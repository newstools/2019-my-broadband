MTN says it has been hard at work capacitating its network in high-density areas and tourist hotspots to carry increased voice and data traffic over the festive season. The group said in a statement on Thursday (12 December), that operations are underway to cater for additional coverage and capacity requirements in selected hotspots. The areas that have been identified for network optimisation are major routes, including: Other areas that have been identified include coastal towns that are popular tourist destinations, it said. “We have embarked on a multi-pronged network optimisation drive to improve network capacity and quality in key nodes in order to ensure that our customers enjoy seamless network experience,” said Giovanni Chiarelli, chief technology and information officer at MTN SA. “We will be working very closely with our vendor partners to monitor network performance around the clock in near real time, and senior management and regional staff will be on standby to attend to any technical issues that may arise.” Chiarelli said that the network optimisation will also entail the deployment of new base stations and technology upgrades on selected 3G and LTE stations, even in the most remote areas. MTN said it will also keep track of its network performance on Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day when demand is expected to peak. Where required, the company said it will deploy mobile base stations in cases where demand exceeds capacity. “This network upgrade exercise seeks to enrich the experience of our customers who will be travelling throughout the length and breadth of this beautiful country either on holiday or visiting loved ones.”
