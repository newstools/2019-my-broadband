The Acer Predator Triton 500 is an incredibly impressive gaming laptop that packs hardware which makes it stand out from competitors. This includes 32GB of DDR4 RAM, two ultra-fast NVMe SSDs, an Intel Core i7-8750H processor, and a GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU. The hardware, which includes several RGB lighting features, is also clearly meant to let people know that it is a powerful gaming device. While the Triton 500 sounds incredible on paper, we decided to use popular benchmarking software 3DMark to see if it stood up to our lofty expectations. 3DMark is PC software that allows users to run various graphics-focused tests to benchmark the gaming capabilities of their system. Users can also share their results online, which allows them to see how their computer stacks up against others from around the world. There are numerous tests that can be done using 3DMark, but we chose two of the most strenuous ones available – Fire Strike and Time Spy. The results of these benchmarks are below. Fire Strike is designed to serve as a DirectX 11 benchmark for powerful gaming PCs. “Fire Strike is very demanding, even for the latest graphics cards,” the benchmark’s description states. 3DMark recommends that users who struggle to achieve decent numbers of frames use the simpler Sky Diver test instead. When we booted up FireStrike, the Triton 500 not only handled it with ease – it absolutely smashed it. The Triton 500 scored 16,226, which is better than 81% of all results. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-331600" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Firestrike-640x241.png" alt="Firestrike" width="640" height="241" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Firestrike-640x241.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Firestrike-600x226.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Firestrike-768x289.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Firestrike-1200x451.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Firestrike.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> We also tested the Triton 500 using Time Spy, which is the DirectX 12 benchmark for gaming PCs. Time Spy offers native support for various new features including asynchronous compute, explicit multi-adapter setups, and multi-threading. Graphics tests are all rendered at a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution – which indicates that this test is only for truly high-performance computers. Again, the Triton 500 performed remarkably in the test, finishing with better results than 67% of all other tested devices. It scored significantly better than the expected score given by 3DMark for 4K gaming PCs – which is a great indication of just how powerful this device is. These benchmark results are further proof that the Predator Triton 500 is a remarkable gaming laptop. This confirms the premium gaming experience that we experienced previously – with the Triton being capable of running new releases like The Outer Worlds and Gears 5 on maximum settings while reaching 100FPS. The Acer Predator Triton 500 even has a Turbo Boost button which allows you to overclock your GPU and increase your fan speeds to their maximum capabilities with a single press. If you’re looking for an incredible laptop gaming experience, there is no need to look further than the Acer Predator Triton 500. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326303" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_8-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_8-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_8-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_8.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326295" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_4-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_4-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_4.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326299" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_6-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_6-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_6-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_6.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326291" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_2-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_2.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326297" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_5-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_5-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_5-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Predator-Triton-500_5.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
