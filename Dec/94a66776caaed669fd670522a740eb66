MTN also confirmed that MoMo will run on the Ericsson Converged Wallet. MTN said MoMo will be available to consumers via USSD on *120*151#. MTN customers can also dial *151# for free to use the service. Additionally, MoMo Android and iOS apps will be available by 30 January 2020. “The introduction of this mobile money service is a pivotal step in MTN’s strategy and represents MTN’s participation in the next phase of increasing convergence we are seeing between financial services and mobile technology,” said MTN SA CEO Godfrey Motsa. The aim of the app is to give 11 million “unbanked” South Africans access to financial services, and also assist the “thinly served” portion of the country’s adult population. “MoMo aims to bridge this gap with this innovative mobile money offering, providing a payments solution that encourages financial inclusion,” said MTN.
