Qualcomm has announced its new flagship mobile processor, the Snapdragon 865. The chipset is expected to be available in upcoming flagship Android phones in 2020, including the Samsung Galaxy S11 and Note 11 series. Notably, it does not support built-in 5G capability, but will need to be paired with Qualcomm’s X55 5G modem to enable these network features. Qualcomm said that the Snapdragon 865 will be exclusive to 5G phones, meaning no 4G devices will include Qualcomm’s premium chip. In addition to the announcement of the 865 chip, Qualcomm has launched the Snapdragon 765, a lower-tier chip that will offer integrated 5G support. According to The Verge, this could indicate that 5G support may soon no longer be limited to flagship devices and could be employed in mid-to-high-range phones. The full specifications of the processors are due to be revealed later today, during the keynote address at Qualcomm’s annual Snapdragon Tech Summit. Qualcomm also announced a new in-display fingerprint sensor named the 3D Sonic Max. The new sensor offers a larger recognition area and the ability to authenticate with two fingers. The company said this would greatly improve the accuracy of the scanner.
