2019 has seen various new subscription services competing for their share of the market. This ultimately benefits the end-user, who now has more options to choose from. Whatever your preferred form of media consumption is – there is probably a subscription service out there for you. Here are some of the best subscription services on the market that you can gift to your friends and family. Perhaps the best-known digital subscription service of them all, Netflix truly popularised the video subscription service model. Offering a seemingly endless list of movies and series, Netflix is still the most popular video subscription service today. Netflix is available in three plans – Basic, Standard, and Premium. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-234064" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Netflix-logo.jpg" alt="Netflix logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Netflix-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Netflix-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Netflix-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Showmax is MultiChoice’s answer to Netflix and offers a variety of high-quality shows not available on Netflix – including local originals. Additionally, DStv Compact or Compact Plus subscribers can get a 50% discount on their Showmax subscription, while the service is free to DStv Premium subscribers. There are also special Vodacom data bundles dedicated specifically to watching Showmax – such as 1GB for just R50. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175761" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Showmax-logo-dark.jpg" alt="Showmax logo dark" width="640" height="430" />  Vodacom’s streaming service continues to collect an impressive range of local and international shows and movies to offer subscribers. Some popular shows available on Video Play include The Bold and the Beautiful, Isidingo, The Lion King, the Fast and the Furious, Black Panther, and Avengers: Infinity War. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312847" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Win-a-free-year-of-free-entertainment-with-Video-Play.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Win-a-free-year-of-free-entertainment-with-Video-Play.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Win-a-free-year-of-free-entertainment-with-Video-Play-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Win-a-free-year-of-free-entertainment-with-Video-Play-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Spotify is the best-known name in music streaming subscription services by a comfortable distance. Spotify offers a variety of popular songs across almost endless genres – if a song has played on radio, it is probably available on Spotify. A free version of Spotify is available, but this version includes adverts and limits the number of song skips a user may use. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228599" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Spotify-logo.jpg" alt="Spotify logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Spotify-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Spotify-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Spotify-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> YouTube is a huge platform, which feeds into their music subscription service offering a vast array of music. One of the benefits of YouTube Music Premium is that any music on the video platform is also available on its music streaming service – meaning users can access a lot of lesser-known and self-published music. YouTube Premium also offers users ad-free viewing of YouTube’s video platform for an additional R12 per month, which is another extremely tempting proposition. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-260403" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/YouTube-Music-640x427.jpg" alt="YouTube Music" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/YouTube-Music.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/YouTube-Music-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Microsoft offers a highly compelling gaming subscription service which allows users to pay a monthly fee and access a wide variety of popular games. While Xbox Game Pass was originally created for the Xbox One console, it is now also available on PC. There is also an option to access both the Xbox One and PC libraries of games. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-308150" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Xbox-Game-Pass-header.jpg" alt="Xbox Game Pass header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Xbox-Game-Pass-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Xbox-Game-Pass-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Xbox-Game-Pass-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
