Former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng has claimed a victory against the SABC in the Western Cape High Court, according to a report by the City Press. Motsoeneng won a court challenge against an application brought by the SABC to force him to pay the legal costs incurred by the public broadcaster. The former SABC COO took legal action against the broadcaster following his termination in June 2017, challenging the SABC for charging him on the basis of comments made during a press conference in April 2017. Motsoeneng argued that the SABC should charge him on the basis of Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s recommendations instead of the comments he made, which the public broadcaster said brought the company into disrepute. He later withdrew this charge and claimed victory against the SABC when it attempted to force him to cover its legal costs but was denied by the court. A source told the City Press that the SABC is spending “far too much money” on legal cases, particularly those brought by disgruntled former employees who were fired for being appointed by Motsoeneng under irregular conditions. The SABC denied these allegations, stating that it had followed recommendations by the parliamentary ad hoc committee and the Public Protector. “The SABC is on record for saying it will not litigate through the media,” the broadcaster told the City Press. The difficult financial position of South Africa’s state-owned enterprises – including the SABC, Eskom, and South African Airways – means that taxpayers may end up paying for bailouts through increased taxes. The government is considering additional tax measures for 2020, despite the fact that overburdened taxpayers are faced with the highest taxes in South African history. Increased taxes could also further frighten the existing taxpayers in the country, which may result in more individuals and companies leaving South Africa.
