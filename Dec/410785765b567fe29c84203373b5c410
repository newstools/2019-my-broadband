Tesla Powerwall is returning to South Africa, Rubicon sales director Greg Blandford has told MyBroadband. Pre-orders from Rubicon open on 2 December and the first shipments will arrive at the end of the year. Package deals with solar panels and inverters will be available at launch through Tesla’s Powerwall Certified Installer network in South Africa. The demand for backup power solutions in South Africa has spiked recently due to Eskom load-shedding. Those who can afford backup power solutions, like Powerwall, can mitigate the effects of load-shedding and keep essential devices like lights, PCs, TVs, and routers running despite their power being out. Powerwall, together with Backup Gateway, will retail at R139,900 in South Africa. This includes VAT and excludes installation. “This is in line with international price points,” Blandford told MyBroadband. He explained the pricing breakdown as follows: Installation costs will typically range from R10,000 to R15,000, and Blandford said it could possibly be higher for more complex installations or for clients that are far away from major city centres. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-328961" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-Powerwall-2-installed.jpg" alt="Stock image of Tesla Powerwall 2 installed at a home" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-Powerwall-2-installed.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-Powerwall-2-installed-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-Powerwall-2-installed-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The original Powerwall was available in South Africa from early 2016. Blandford said that local suppliers sold the batteries as quickly as they could land stock in the country. Tesla unveiled Powerwall 2 in October 2016, just over a year after CEO Elon Musk introduced the original Powerwall. Powerwall 2 can provide 13.5kWh of usable energy, and can be completely discharged without damage to the battery. It has a built-in AC inverter and can supply 5kW of continuous power to a home or office. Since it has a built-in inverter, Powerwall can be installed with new or existing solar panels, or without solar panels and used purely as a backup device in the event of a power outage. When combined with a solar energy system, Blandford said, Powerwall’s grid-forming feature enables solar panels to remain operational during a power outage. Tesla states that this transition to backup mode happens seamlessly during an outage. Powerwall will be available throughout South Africa and distributed from Rubicon in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. Pre-orders may be placed through the Rubicon website, or through Tesla Powerwall Certified Installers. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-190210 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tesla-Powerwall-2-dimensions-1.jpg" alt="tesla-powerwall-2-dimensions" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tesla-Powerwall-2-dimensions-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tesla-Powerwall-2-dimensions-1-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> (function() { var scribd = document.createElement("script"); scribd.type = "text/javascript"; scribd.async = true; scribd.src = "https://www.scribd.com/javascripts/embed_code/inject.js"; var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(scribd, s); })();
