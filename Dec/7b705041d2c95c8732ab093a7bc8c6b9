Bolt has announced that it will launch its own food delivery service in South Africa in the next few months. Named Bolt Food, the service launched in Estonia in August 2019, in Lithuania in November 2019, and is planned to launch in South Africa, Latvia, and Finland in the coming months, the company said. Bolt said that South Africa would be one of the first three countries in which the service will be offered. “Bolt’s focus on Europe and Africa sets us apart from our competitors, and the success of this strategy is clear, with South Africa now one of our top markets globally,” said Bolt co-founder and CEO Markus Villig. “South Africa is our largest country market in Africa, and Johannesburg is our largest city of operations in Africa,” he said. Bolt also announced that it had greatly increased its South African operations this past year by launching ride-hailing services in up to 34 secondary towns and cities across all nine provinces. The ride-hailing platform doubled its operational footprint across the country and now includes previously-unserviced locations such as eMalahleni, Mthatha, Vereeniging, Richard’s Bay, Thohoyandou, Mahikeng, and Potchefstroom. Bolt employs over 150 permanent staff in South Africa, who provide a variety of support services to drivers and riders using its ride-hailing platform. The company said its staff complement is set to increase in 2020 as part of its continued expansion strategy. “Bolt’s growth is based on offering the best prices for passengers and the lowest commissions for drivers, and this combination has enabled us to grow more quickly and cost-efficiently than any other ride-hailing platform,” said Bolt South Africa country manager Gareth Taylor. “Ride-hailing makes it possible for more people to enjoy the convenience of getting from one place to another, without the costs of car ownership or the inconvenience of public transport,” Taylor said.
