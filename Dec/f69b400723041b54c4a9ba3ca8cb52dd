Zando is working tirelessly to address order delays and to provide feedback to customers about their expected delivery dates, the company told MyBroadband. This is according to Zando MD Grant Brown, following complaints about delayed orders on Facebook and Hellopeter. MyBroadband also received emails from Zando clients, who complained about their online orders not being delivered on time. Clients on Facebook and Hellopeter stated that orders from late November and early December have not been delivered on time, and many were still waiting to receive their purchases. Clients also stated that Zando was not responding to questions about their orders in a timely manner, after which Zando posted a notice to its Facebook page about its delayed responses. The notice, posted on 18 December and shown below, said that Zando apologises to clients for delayed responses and that the company was experiencing high volumes of calls, emails, and social media messages. “Our customer service team is working hard to get back to you as soon as possible,” it said. Brown told MyBroadband that Zando firstly apologises to customers who have been impacted by order delays. “In preparation for the 2019 Black Friday period, Zando upscaled its operations and customer service teams. However, due to the high volume of orders received over the Black Friday period, we, unfortunately, have had a delay in delivering orders to some of our customers.” “The large number of orders have, in turn, resulted in a high number of customer queries, which has caused a backlog in our customer service department.” “We have adopted an all-hands-on-deck approach and we are working tirelessly in addressing the queries being received across all our channels, including social media.” Zando previously stated that it saw a big growth in sales during Black Friday 2019. The company experienced a 40% increase in sales compared to Black Friday 2018, which equated to 40 orders being placed every minute. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-333066" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Zando.png" alt="Zando" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Zando.png 960w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Zando-400x400.png 400w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Zando-430x430.png 430w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Zando-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
