The South African Police Service (SAPS) has arrested a suspect in Cape Town for illegally selling pirated Internet streaming devices and online content subscriptions. The investigation followed information received by the SAPS provincial commercial detective unit regarding pirate activities which let users illegally view MultiChoice content, as well as that of other international TV providers. “We are proud that we have been able to support the South African Police in this important investigation and arrest,” said Joe Heshu, Group Executive for Corporate Affairs at MultiChoice Group. “Content redistribution is a growing problem and has emerged as one of the main forms of piracy over recent years, particularly when it comes to live content such as high-profile sports events.” “It is important for us to work with the relevant law enforcement agencies to ensure we swiftly and purposefully address this criminal activity.” Security firm Irdeto, a subsidiary of MultiChoice, worked alongside SAPS in this investigation. Anti-piracy director at Irdeto, Frikkie Jonker, said that content theft has become a fully-fledged criminal enterprise that must be fought. “To effectively combat piracy, content owners, operators and service providers must rely on cutting-edge anti-piracy technologies to identify the source of pirated content and allow for its immediate shutdown.” “Irdeto is committed to continuing to work proactively with customers, partners and law enforcement to identify and prosecute the parties involved in large commercial streaming piracy networks.” The accused appeared in court on 5 December, and the case was postponed until February 2020. The accused was released on R2,000 bail. SAPS said it is planning more arrests as it focuses its attention on other pirate Internet streaming operations in South Africa.
