2019 has seen many successful game launches across various consoles and platforms. These range from sports games to open-world RPGs, and comprise brand-new IPs as well as new iterations from popular franchises. 2020 is expected to be the year that both Sony and Microsoft launch their next-generation PlayStation and Xbox consoles respectively – meaning that it is likely to be a year full of impressive games with improved graphics and features.
