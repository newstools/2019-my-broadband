The Acer Swift 3 is a capable ultra-thin laptop suited to both working professionals and students. It forms part of the wide range of Acer notebooks that cover multiple use-cases, from run-of-the-mill office work and multimedia editing to gaming and high-demand workstation requirements. The Swift 3 is intended to help mainstream computer users get work done seamlessly from anywhere. To put this to the test, we tested out the device. The Swift 3 boasts a 14-inch 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display with good viewing angles and high brightness levels – this is great for bright or dark environments. The laptop’s entire chassis is made with a magnesium-aluminium alloy, which ensures a solid but lightweight build. Our model came in a steel-grey brushed finish that looks refined and professional. The surface is easy to clean and did not show any signs of fingerprints or stain marks after repeated handling. The Swift 3’s components are intended for high-performance multitasking while maintaining enough power to last for a typical work day. Our device boasted a 10th-generation Core i5 processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM and 256GB of lightning-fast NVMe solid-state storage. The Swift 3 we were given to review also had a dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX250 GPU with 2GB of VRAM. Logging on and getting started was made easy thanks to the laptop’s built-in fingerprint sensor. The keyboard and trackpad were great – even after I had just started working on the laptop, I very rarely made no mistakes when typing quickly. Multitasking was also swift and seamless, with apps and programs opening quickly. Acer claims that the laptop can run for 12-and-a-half hours on a single charge, but heavy use will manage a respectable 7 hours. Carrying the laptop around in one hand or under your arm is easy, and it is also comfortable to work on while placed on your lap. The 75W charging brick is small and light, which makes the whole setup easier to carry around. Another commendable feature of the Swift 3 is its variety of ports and connectivity options. Thanks to this, you will have no problem connecting it to an external storage or a display. On the left side of the laptop, you will find ports for Thunderbolt 3 USB-C, USB 3.1, and HDMI connectors, as well as a small port for the charger. The right side of the laptop sports a 3.5mm audio jack and a USB 2.0 port. Whether you require the Acer Swift 3 for work, assignments, or light gaming, it is unlikely to disappoint. The Swift 3 is available in a variety of configurations from the Acer Shop.
