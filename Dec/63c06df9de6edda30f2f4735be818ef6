MTN has introduced new “Hello World” roaming data bundles, the company announced on 20 December. The bundles are aimed at MTN clients who plan to travel and can be used in 21 countries where MTN has operations in Africa and the Middle East – such as Botswana and Nigeria. MTN said the data bundles are available to contract, top-up, and prepaid customers – and are “competitively priced from as little as 29c per MB”. The bundles are priced as follows: “As the world gets smaller, the demand for data roaming continues to grow. However, data roaming services can be costly,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, Executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA. “These roaming bundles are meant to give customers the opportunity to enjoy their travels and share memorable experiences and moments with loved ones without the inconvenience of looking for a Wi-Fi hotspot, using a local SIM card, and the anxiety of a bill shock.” Additionally, MTN customers are able to opt in or opt out of roaming bundles. “Our hope it that these bundles will bring a bit of festive cheer to customers who are finalising preparations to travel for the holidays or visit family and friends.”
