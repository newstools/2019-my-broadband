Plex has launched a free streaming service for all its account holders. The company announced in September that it would partner with Warner Bros. to offer movies and shows before the end of 2019. Viewers will now have access to thousands of movies, TV shows, extreme sports films, music documentaries, and Bollywood musicals free of charge. Content available includes shows and movies from Warner Bros. and other major production houses like Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Lionsgate, and Legendary. Unlike other streaming services that rely on a monthly subscriber fee for funding, Plex’s revenue will be driven by ads. However, Plex has said that these will be “only about one-third the amount of ads you’d expect on cable television”. The library will be available to all free Plex account holders in over 200 countries, including South Africa. Current movie titles featured include Lord of War, Rain Man, Raging Bull, The Terminator, and Apocalypse Now, with more to be added. Although certain shows and movies may be unavailable in particular areas due to local content licensing agreements, Plex stated that the “vast majority” of content will be accessible worldwide. The Plex app is supported on smart TVs and streaming boxes from all major manufacturers, as well as gaming consoles.
