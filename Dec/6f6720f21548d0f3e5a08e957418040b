Windows 10 saw a surprising decrease in desktop operating system market share in November 2019, according to data from NetMarketShare. It is still the dominant desktop operating system, boasting 53.33% of market share, but is down nearly 1% from October 2019. This is in contrast with previous months, which saw a significant increase in the market share of the latest Windows operating system. The operating system with the second largest market share, Windows 7, saw a negligible decrease to 26.86% in November. Windows 7 had seen a much larger decline in its market share over the past few months, falling from 36.43% in April to 26.94% in October. This historic decrease is largely due to the fact that Microsoft will stop supporting this older operating system from 14 January 2020. Of the other popular operating systems, MacOS X 10.14 and 10.15 have a combined market share of 8.08%, while Windows 8.1 has a market share of 3.32%. Microsoft has encouraged users to upgrade from older operating systems like Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, to its latest operating system – Windows 10. The fact that Windows 7 will lose support in January 2020 means that upgrading from Windows 7 is particularly urgent. While the official free upgrade period which allowed users to upgrade from Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 has expired, it is still possible to make the switch at no cost. This is thanks to an exploit which allows users to upgrade to Windows 10 by manipulating their device’s system clock.
