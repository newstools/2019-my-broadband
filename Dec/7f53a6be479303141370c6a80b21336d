The ASUS ROG Strix Scar III is a mobile machine built for serious gaming enthusiasts. While the ASUS Zephyrus series is tailored to an ultra-thin gaming experience and the TUF range focuses on affordability, the Strix Scar III is unashamedly built for the hardcore gamer. Those in the market for a notebook that boasts both impressive hardware and a premium finish should consider this laptop. ASUS kindly supplied us with a ROG Strix Scar III to try out – here are our thoughts. The Scar III has a sharp black rectangular design which is the result of a collaboration between ASUS and BMW Designworks. The lid has a brushed metal finish, with a pronounced mirrored ROG logo, while the rest of the chassis is made of robust plastic, with the interior featuring a carbon fibre-like matte pattern. Narrow bezels line the top and sides of the 17.3-inch 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display, which boasts a 144Hz refresh rate and a 3ms response time. These specifications, together with its coverage of 100% of the sRGB colour gamut, makes this panel one of the best of its kind for portable gaming and multimedia editing. The ASUS ROG Strix Scar III also draws the eye through the bright RGB lighting that runs along the sides and bottom of its chassis. The colours and programming of this wraparound light bar are fully customisable using ASUS’s Aura Sync software. The keyboard also features per-key RGB configuration, allowing you to manually adjust each button to a colour of your choice. The lighting configuration of the ROG logo on the lid of the device can also be programmed. With the type of hardware the Scar III delivers, gamers, multimedia editors, and processing-heavy users will be treated to excellent performance. Our unit came was outfitted with a six-core 9th-generation Intel Core i7 chip paired with 16GB of DDR4 RAM. It also had a 512GB M.2 NVMe SSD, allowing for extremely fast application load times and data transfers. Gaming-wise, the Scar III will be able to handle any new title you throw at it. A GeForce RTX 2070 with 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM ensures high frame rates in triple-A titles like Battlefield V, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Far Cry: New Dawn with the settings on high or ultra. The laptop also offers plenty of options for expandability. On the left side of the Scar III are three USB 3.1 ports and a 3.5mm audio jack, while the right side only sports the port for ASUS’s Keystone NFC module, keeping the area clear for optimal mouse movement. The Keystone is a small NFC module which can be used to store all of your gaming and RGB profiles and acts as a lock for your Shadow Drive, a hidden partition you can create to securely store sensitive data. Along the back of the laptop is an HDMI and a USB-C port, as well as the port for the power adapter. A 66Wh battery pack will provide around 4 hours of use under moderate to heavy loads, which is great considering the fact that most gaming will be done while plugged in. Overall, we found the ASUS ROG Strix Scar III to be a great-looking, high-performing gaming machine. The Scar III is available in a variety of configurations from Evetech and Takealot. Our specific review unit is priced at R45,000 on Evetech.
