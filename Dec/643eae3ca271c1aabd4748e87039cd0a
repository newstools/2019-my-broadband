The Pirate Bay is testing a new video streaming feature which will let users watch video content on its platform instantly, TorrentFreak reports. The Pirate Bay is traditionally used as an extensive source of magnet links for downloading various types of content through peer-to-peer file sharing. “In addition to the familiar magnet and trusted uploader icons displayed alongside video and TV show releases, the site also features a small orange ‘B’ graphic,” explained TorrentFreak. This graphic takes the user to a platform called BayStream, where they can stream the listed content within their browser. “Loading times appear swift when the content is actually available,” said TorrentFreak. TorrentFreak highlighted that the service is still highly buggy, such as the fact that accessing the BayStream links from The Pirate Bay proxy sites causes various errors. It is unclear at this point whether the service is run by The Pirate Bay, but BayStream reportedly has links to Sweden, hinting towards a relationship of some kind. The Pirate Bay previously tried to enter the streaming market by testing “Stream It” link alongside its video torrents which were viewable through the Torrents-Time plug-in.
