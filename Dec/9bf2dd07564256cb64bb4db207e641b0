The first question most people will ask you when you tell them you have a new PC monitor is: What size and resolution is it? For PC gamers whose noses are 50cm from the screen when they play, however, size is not first prize. Refresh rate, response time, and G-Sync support are much higher on the priority list. This is highlighted perfectly by Acer’s Predator XB1 gaming monitor range – which includes a 24-inch model which Acer South Africa provided to MyBroadband for testing. The XB1 24-inch model has a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution over a – you guessed it – 24-inch TN panel with LED backlighting. When setting up the display the first thing you notice is all the specs listed on the box, including the one which states this is the official display of the Intel Extreme Masters gaming tournament. Other specifications include: That last line references the stand which comes with the display, and it is worth a few words. All parts clip together smoothly, and there is only one screw at the base which must be tightened to keep all elements in place. The display can then be turned and tilted, and raised and lowered with ease – allowing me to position it at exactly the right height for gaming. The photos below show the adjustments in action. Unfortunately, the smoothness with which you can move the monitor is not captured in mere images. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-330917" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor05.jpg" alt="Acer Monitor" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor05.jpg 933w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor05-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor05-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor05-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-330921" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor06.jpg" alt="Acer Monitor" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor06.jpg 933w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor06-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor06-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor06-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-330919" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor02.jpg" alt="Acer Monitor" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor02.jpg 933w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor02-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor02-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor02-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Following the stand adjustments, it was time to game. I used a DisplayPort cable to connect the monitor to my gaming PC. An HDMI port is also included with the display. The colour settings out of the box were good, and all that was required was to set the monitor’s refresh rate to 144Hz in Windows for maximum speed. After the customary “dragging Window around” test was done to ensure the refresh rate was active, the choice of game was simple: Doom. With fast action and colourful scenery (and alien body explosions), it tested the abilities of the monitor nicely. As I have no friends, organising a quick match in Counter-Strike was not on the cards, but the bots did look crisps as they flitted around the screen dodging what was to come. Of course, an explanation is no match for seeing it in person – and I encourage you to keep an eye out for any store demo models on display, as they are worth taking a look at. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-330925" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor12.jpg" alt="Acer Monitor" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor12.jpg 933w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor12-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor12-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor12-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Of course, the monitor must also look good as a piece of hardware – otherwise, it has no place in a gaming setup. Colour-coding is essential, and fortunately, my red-and-black gaming PC was perfectly matched by the red-and-black design of the Predator XB1. As shown in the photo below, the monitor’s aesthetics definitely enhance the image of amazingness that is my rig is trying to portray. (Minus the blue gaming mouse which snuck into the shot.) In summary: the Predator XB1 looks good, runs well, and leaves gamers with no room for excuses when they perish at the hands of friends in a Friday night LAN. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-330923" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor03.jpg" alt="Acer Monitor" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor03.jpg 933w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor03-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor03-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor03-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-330929" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor07.jpg" alt="Acer Monitor" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor07.jpg 933w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor07-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor07-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Monitor07-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
