South Africa has a huge debt problem and millions of citizens are facing a “financial meltdown” in 2020. This is according to debt experts who were quoted in a report by the Sunday Times. The report stated that the middle class is particularly hard hit, and that a lack of salary increases and bonuses in 2019 will see more people borrowing money in the new year as the price of living increases. This is despite 10 million people in South Africa suffering with bad debt – meaning they have missed multiple loan repayments. Of those with bad debt, each person has an average of 8 loans. These people also spend “63% of their after-tax income on repayments”. It is also not only individuals with jobs who have debt, stated the report. South Africa has an “incredibly high number” of unemployed people who are in debt, and many are borrowing money to pay for food and transport. Additionally, borrowing money to pay for food is facilitated by retailers – who provide lines of credit to customers. Debt Rescue CEO Neil Roets said those affected the most by debt are between 25 and 35. “This group wants to be seen to be living a certain lifestyle,” he said. The country’s debt problem extends beyond consumers, however, and several of the biggest contributors to huge amounts of local debt are the state-owned enterprises. Eskom is leading the list, and as of December its debt was sitting at R450 billion – with 62% of this debt government-guaranteed. The matter is compounded by the fact that Eskom load-shedding has cost South Africa over R8.5 billion this year. The cost of load-shedding considers GDP from the supply side and uses assumptions about the ability of an industry to mitigate the cost of downtime. Other state-owned enterprises including SAA and the SABC are in similar situations, requiring billions of rand from the government in bailouts to stay afloat.
