AMD is set to unveil a new graphics card in early 2020, according to a report by TechRadar. The report referenced GPU filings by Gigabyte with the Eurasian Economic Commission – and were said to contain the Radeon RX 5600 XT range from AMD. The new card will sit between the high-end RX 5700 XT and entry-level RX 5500, which was revealed in October. AMD’s RX 5500 card competes with Nvidia’s budget graphics chips, including the GeForce GTX 1060 and GTX 1650. The card is also made with the same 7nm Navi architecture that is used in the more powerful Radeon RX 5700 XT. Details about the RX 5600 XT are minimal, but point to a card with 6GB of RAM and a 192-bit memory bus width – and that an OC version of the card will be available. The report added that Gigabyte will launch 32 new GPUs in the near future, including new RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT graphics cards. No firm date has been provided, but it is speculated that the cards may be launched at CES 2020 in January.
