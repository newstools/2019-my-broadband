Sony has announced that one of its games will be available on other consoles for the first time. In a joint statement with Major League Baseball (MLB), Sony announced that baseball simulation game MLB The Show will have a shared licence. “The historic expansion of the long-standing partnerships will bring MLB The Show, for the first time ever, to additional console platforms beyond PlayStation platforms as early as 2021,” said the companies. At this point, it is unclear which consoles the game will launch on, as neither MLB nor Sony was willing to disclose this information. It is also unclear whether any future PlayStation exclusives will make their way onto other consoles. This news is the latest in Sony’s apparent willingness to open up the historic exclusivity of its PlayStation platform. In October, Sony told Wired that it’s PlayStation 4 cross-play efforts have moved out of beta, meaning that the console can now support cross-play for any titles that decide to use this feature. Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said that Sony has made this decision to ensure that it doesn’t get complacent despite the PlayStation 4 beating Microsoft’s Xbox One sales numbers. “The track record of the incumbent platform winning the next time around is not a great one,” said Ryan. “So the major thrust of my executive energy is to avoid complacency.”
