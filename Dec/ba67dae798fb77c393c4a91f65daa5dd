Rain has started bundling Huawei’s outdoor 5G CPE with its 5G packages, the company confirmed to MyBroadband. This follows a MyBroadband reader stating that he had his indoor 5G router replaced with the outdoor unit – a Huawei 5G CPE N5368X. “We are now bundling the Huawei 5G CPE X with our 5G offering. It is a router than can be used indoor as well mounted outdoor,” said Rain. “It comes with a 10-metre flat power-over-Ethernet cable which makes installation very easy,” added the company. Using an outdoor 5G router can improve signal strength for the end user, allowing for faster speeds and overall improved performance. Huawei has stated that the 5G CPE was designed with “simplified installation and optimal experience in mind”. It supports all mainstream 5G frequency bands and meets the requirements for large-scale commercial use of 5G. The CPE 2.0 promotes 5G development and marks a new milestone in the search for ever better means of communication,” stated Huawei’s website. Rain recently told MyBroadband that it has big expansion plans for the future, which will see it grow its 4G and 5G network coverage. The company said it wants to build its network in a big way and compete directly with fibre operators across the country. “Currently Rain has 3,200 4G sites, and we have 250 5G sites,” said Rain CEO Willem Roos. “In terms of 4G sites, the Rain network is probably larger than Cell C’s, and probably approaching the size of Telkom’s network – the scale is significant.” He said that by the end of 2020, Rain plans to have 5,000 4G sites and 700 5G sites in South Africa.
