Vivo has officially launched its smartphone brand in South Africa, making its new devices available through local channels. The Chinese smartphone manufacturer has rolled out two handsets which will be available from 7 December 2019 – the Vivo Y11 and Vivo Y91C. Both are mid-range devices with impressive specifications that will compete with Samsung and Huawei’s budget offerings. The Y11 uses a Snapdragon chipset and the Y91C has a MediaTek chip. Both devices sport modern, full-screen designs reminiscent of flagship smartphones. Both smartphones run Vivo’s FunTouch operating system, which is based on Android. The Vivo Y11 and Y91C run Android 9.0 and Android 8.1 respectively. “We are very excited to be bringing this technology to South Africa,” said Vivo Mobile South Africa marketing director Hawa Hyath. “VIVO is a hugely successful global brand that is known for its innovation and style. With global R&D centres, VIVO is consistently refining their offering to bring consumers the very best phone offering – in our pursuit of perfection we always aim to address user pain points thereby continuing to innovate and provide best user value.” “By launching ahead of the holiday season we are also giving consumers the choice to use the phones’ superlative cameras to capture holiday moments,” Hyath said. “Additionally the Y11’s front-facing selfie camera with AI face beauty technology ensures perfect selfies are never left to chance.” Vivo’s new Y11 and Y91C smartphones will be available in South Africa from 7 December 2019 from Vodacom and selected retailers.
