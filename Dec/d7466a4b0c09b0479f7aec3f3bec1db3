Huawei will release an upgraded version of its foldable smartphone, the Mate X, next year. This was revealed in an interview between Frandroid and Huawei’s head of consumer business, Richard Yu. Yu said that the revamped device will boast a faster processor, improved hinge, and tougher screen. He further stated that the current Mate X is scheduled for a release in Europe in early 2020. The Mate X was launched in China in November after a long delay owing to the ongoing US-China trade war. It differs from Samsung’s Galaxy Fold and Motorola’s new Razr in that its screen wraps back around the device, instead of folding towards the front. Yu also divulged more details about Huawei’s next P-series flagship during the interview. The P40 will reportedly have an improved camera and faster performance in a seemingly unique new design. It should be noted that OnLeaks and 91Mobile revealed renders of what the P40 could look like yesterday. These appear to indicate a similar rectangular camera design that can be seen in leaks of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S11. One notable characteristic, however, is the quad-curved screen. Each corner of the phone appears to have the display curve over the edge rather than meet the end at a right angle, with the metal back wrapping around to the front. According to Yu, the P40 will launch at the end of March 2020.
