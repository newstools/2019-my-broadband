CS:GO players from Goliath Gaming will represent South Africa at the upcoming DreamHack Delhi event. The tournament, which will take place from 6 – 8 December, will pit players from various countries against each other for a prize pool of $55,000. Dean “massacRe” Davids, captain of the team, said the players are excited about the opportunity – which will be the first time these players compete on a global stage. “As a gamer, being invited to an event like DreamHack with the opportunity to represent your region on the global stage is something incredible. We’re going to give it our best shot and hope to make those in SA proud.” Teammate Rikus ‘ZIPZIP’ Klue said that the team has been practising hard ahead of the tournament to ensure that they are as prepared for the tournament as possible. “We will be wrapping up our preparations with a week-long bootcamp before we depart to Delhi,” said Klue. The full team is as follows: Alongside this CS:GO tournament, DreamHack Delhi will host a variety of competitions across titles such as Street Fighter V, Super Smash Bros, Tekken 7, and PUBG. “Last year’s DreamHack hosted in Mumbai was historical as it was the first DreamHack festival ever to be held in Asia,” said DreamHack Co-CEO Marcus Lindmark. “This made DreamHack Delhi a natural next step in our effort in making the DreamHack experience the perfect culmination of the gaming year in India.”
