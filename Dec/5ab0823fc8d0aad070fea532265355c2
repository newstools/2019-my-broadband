Huawei’s recently-unveiled MatePad Pro is an intriguing entry to the premium tablet market and is set to take on Apple’s iPad dominance in this area. To see how the devices stack up, we compared the specifications of Huawei’s MatePad Pro against Apple’s 2018 iPad Pro. Many reviews have pointed out that the MatePad Pro mimics the sleek and slim design of the iPad Pro. Although there are similarities, Huawei’s tablet distinguishes itself in several ways. The MatePad Pro sports 4.9mm bezels on its display, with a 10.8-inch 2,560 x 1,600 LCD screen that offers 280 pixels per inch (ppi). This gives the device a screen-to-body-ratio of 90%. It also features a hole-punch selfie camera in the top right of the screen (when held vertically). The iPad Pro features slightly larger bezels around its 11-inch 2,388 x 1,688 LCD display (265 ppi), with the front camera in the top bezel. When it comes to form-factor, the devices weigh roughly the same, while the iPad Pro is marginally thinner. The iPad Pro is available in grey and silver, while the MatePad Pro has four more colour options:  blue, white, green, and orange. Performance-wise, both tablets boast specifications on par with their manufacturer’s flagship smartphones. The MatePad Pro comes with Huawei’s fastest mobile processor, the eight-core Kirin 990, which is paired with 6GB RAM in the 128GB LTE version, and 8GB RAM in the 256GB LTE model. The iPad Pro employs the A12X Bionic processor, which is combined with 4GB RAM in the 64GB, 256GB and 512GB models, while the top-of-the-line 1TB build gets 6GB RAM. To keep the tablets powered throughout the day, the MatePad Pro features a 7,250mAh battery, while the iPad Pro boasts a larger 7,812mAh pack. Both the MatePad Pro and iPad Pro offer support for a stylus and attachable keyboard covers, and the latest styluses from Huawei and Apple can be attached magnetically to the sides of the tablets for wireless charging. In the wake of the US-China trade war, several Huawei devices do not support Google services and apps on its Android-based OS. The MatePad Pro is one of these devices, and runs EMUI 10 on top of Android 10. However, Huawei has said it is working on launching replacement apps which will see Google’s services replaced. Additionally, the MatePad Pro allows Huawei smartphone users to mirror their devices in a window on the tablet. So effectively, it can show Google apps running on its display. The iPad Pro uses Apple’s iPadOS, a mobile operating system designed specifically for the company’s tablets. It works in much the same way as iOS on smartphones, but has been praised for its multitasking and file management features, closely aligning its capability with that of a laptop. Where Huawei has got Apple beat, though, is in the pricing of its flagship tablet. When comparing the LTE models of the tablets, a significant price gap can be observed. The 128GB LTE MatePad Pro is priced at 3,799 yuan in China, or just under R8,000, while the 256GB edition will cost you 4,499 yuan, which equates to just over R9,200. The iPad Pro’s 64GB LTE unit costs R17,699 locally, and the 256GB variant is priced at R20,499. It must be noted that the MatePad Pro’s pricing is a direct currency conversion, and does not include import fees, transport costs, taxes, and so on. The table below compares the components of the LTE versions of 10.8-inch Huawei MatePad Pro with the 11-inch Apple iPad Pro. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-332996" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MatePad-Pro_1-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MatePad-Pro_1.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MatePad-Pro_1-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MatePad-Pro_1-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-332994" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iPad-Pro-1-1-640x430.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iPad-Pro-1-1.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iPad-Pro-1-1-595x400.jpeg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iPad-Pro-1-1-300x202.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
