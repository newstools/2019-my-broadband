2019 certainly had its fair share of powerful new smartphones. All the biggest players – Samsung, Huawei and Apple – came to the table, while smaller manufacturers and old favourites also weighed in with unique and interesting devices. The mid-range segment showed extensive growth, with Samsung and Huawei exchanging blows via their A-series and Y-series devices respectively. New flagships boasted bigger and better cameras, with improvements in performance and battery life optimisation also making their way to top-end handsets. The hype over foldable displays, meanwhile, was met with the reality of the developmental challenges presented by this new technology. Samsung had to delay the release of its Fold after various design issues caused malfunctions. Huawei finally released the Mate X, although it has so far only been launched in China with no support for Google services or apps. The foldable Motorola Razr was also launched, but will only be available from January 2020. Until these devices become more widely available, we can appreciate the more traditional flagship smartphones which headlined the past year’s releases. The following is a list of five of the best smartphones from 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-331836" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/S10-Plus-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/S10-Plus.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/S10-Plus-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/S10-Plus-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300552" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Pro-header.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 Pro header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Pro-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Pro-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Pro-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319595" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4.jpg" alt="iPhone 11 Pro 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-331834" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mate-30-Pro-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mate-30-Pro.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mate-30-Pro-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mate-30-Pro-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-331830" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Note-10-Plus-1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Note-10-Plus-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Note-10-Plus-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Note-10-Plus-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
