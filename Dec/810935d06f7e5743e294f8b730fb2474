Mobile operator Rain is making good progress in the roll-out of its data network and will significantly expand its infrastructure in the coming year, say investors African Rainbow Capital (ARC). In an investment update published on Friday (6 December), ARC said that key to achieving this is the network’s contractual roaming agreement with Vodacom. “(This agreement) essentially is one of Rain connecting its devices to a specified number of Vodacom’s towers to establish and expand its 4G network. “At the same time, Vodacom purchases data from Rain which it can on-sell to Vodacom customers. The net result of this relationship is that Rain can sustainably fund its tower network roll-out. By the end of November Rain had about 3,150 active 4G roaming sites,” ARC said. The group noted that Rain has also launched a 5G network in September 2019, making South Africa one of the first countries in the world to have a 5G network. “By end of November rain rolled out 250 5G towers and aims to roll out 700 5G towers by December 2020, ultimately having 2,000 5G towers in key metro areas in South Africa,” it said.
