The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is now more popular on Steam than it was at launch four years ago, according to the game’s developer. CD Projekt Red’s community lead Marcin Momot tweeted a screenshot of the player count on Steam on 29 December, claiming a new record for the number of concurrent players at 93,835 people. This is more than the previous peak of 92,268 players it had at launch in May 2015. At the time of writing, the PC version of The Witcher 3 was still the eighth most-played title on Steam. The game is currently available for R150 on the Steam Store. The uptake was likely driven by the release of the new Netflix series The Witcher on 20 December. The show, which is based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski, has received mixed reviews from critics – but appears to be a hit with viewers, with a 93% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Although Netflix did not disclose viewership numbers, it ranked the title at number 2 on its list of most-popular series, and number 6 of all its releases (including movies) of 2020.
