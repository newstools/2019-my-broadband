Whether you’re a fan of blockchain technology or an investor looking for a potentially large return, it can pay to have Bitcoin in your investment portfolio. Many South Africans who purchased cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum saw impressive returns on their investments, especially during major boom periods such as in 2017, when the price of Bitcoin increased from around $1,000 to almost $20,000. As with any investment, there is also the risk of your cryptocurrency dropping in value – and Bitcoin’s price has subsided from its highs in December 2017. This should not dissuade South Africans from purchasing a small amount of cryptocurrency to gain exposure to the market, however, and to learn more about the technology which drives it. In South Africa, a cryptocurrency investment can also help to shield individuals from a stagnant economy and volatile rand.
