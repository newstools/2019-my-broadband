MyBroadband has released its November 2019 customer satisfaction ratings, which show that Cybersmart and Supersonic are the best Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in South Africa. These ratings are based on 13,203 responses from South African broadband subscribers who used MyBroadband’s web-based, Android, and iOS speed test apps between 1-30 November 2019. After users performed a speed test, they rated their ISP based on their overall satisfaction with their provider. These customer satisfaction ratings were then used to rank South Africa’s ISPs and mobile operators, with an equal weight given to the mobile app and web-based results. [Test your speed now: MyBroadband Speed Test | Speedtest.co.za] The table below provides an overview of the ratings of prominent fibre, ADSL, and fixed-LTE service providers in South Africa. It shows that Cybersmart, Supersonic, and Mind the Speed are the top ISPs, while Telkom, Rain, and MWEB have the worst customer satisfaction ratings. One of the biggest movers was Cool Ideas, which dropped towards the bottom of the table after topping the rankings in 2017. This decline is partly linked to the recent crippling DDoS attacks on the Cool Ideas network which left many subscribers without Internet access. It is also noteworthy that Afrihost started to climb up the rankings after a mediocre performance earlier in the year.
