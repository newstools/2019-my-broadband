South Africa will take several months to determine how best to deal with its debt, said Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Eskom has amassed 454 billion rand ($31 billion) of debt to date. Freeman Nomvalo, who was named Eskom’s chief restructuring officer on July 30, has proposed options to reorganize the debt. National Treasury is now doing further work on them, Gordhan said in reply to a question from a lawmaker in parliament in Cape Town on Tuesday. “We will engage with lenders to Eskom to see what appetite they have to resolving the debt issue,” he said. Eskom anticipates a R20-billion loss for the full economic year due to lower demand and prices in the summer months, it has said previously. “The Eskom turnaround remains a long and difficult journey,” Jabu Mabuza, Eskom’s chairman and acting chief executive officer, said. “The ultimate goal is to make Eskom profitable.” The government has said the utility is too big to fail and allocated it R138 billion over the next three years to enable it to keep operating. The government plans to split the utility into generation, distribution and transmission units under a state holding company — a reorganization it says will make it easier to raise financing and improve efficiency. This month it was announced that Andre de Ruyter, currently the CEO of packaging company Nampak Ltd., will take the helm at Eskom on Jan. 15.
