OnePlus will reportedly release a more affordable smartphone as part of its 2020 line-up. This is according to a leak posted by @OnLeaks and 91mobiles, which posted information and renders of a device that will supposedly be named the OnePlus 8 Lite. According to the reports, the mid-range smartphone sports either a flat 6.4 or 6.5-inch display, with a hole-punch front camera in the top of the screen. The back of the phone features a curved glass panel with a dual-camera system. 91mobiles said the device will likely feature an in-display fingerprint sensor in an OLED display. The design shown in the renders is reminiscent of leaks of Samsung’s Galaxy S11. OnePlus smartphones have gained popularity thanks to their high-end specifications and affordable price-points.
