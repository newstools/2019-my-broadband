OfferZen has several initiatives planned for 2020, including a drive to grow South Africa’s technology sector. The company told MyBroadband that it will continue to invest in making South Africa “a great place to be in tech”. It will also double-down on the initiatives it has in place. “We are also evolving our business model to enable us to partner with our companies and help them build winning tech teams,” said OfferZen. “That goes beyond helping them with access to talent – it extends to helping them with their employer value proposition, accessing and attracting top graduate talent, and helping them build world-class hiring practices.” OfferZen said if it can help companies with the above, they will “be more internationally competitive” for talent, as well as more successful as a business. Additionally, OfferZen will continue to collaborate with Investec, and its community of software developers, to make programmable banking a reality in South Africa. OfferZen joined forces with Investec in 2019 to build a programmable bank account for developers – “a first step to enabling the tech community with financial systems access”. “The initial response has been overwhelmingly positive,” said OfferZen. This will provide programmable access to an Investec bank account, which includes access to a hosted code editor on the online banking platform. Bank account API access is also planned for the future – and will provide access to transactions and the ability to make payments via API.
