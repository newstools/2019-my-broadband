Huawei South Africa has launched a promotion on component replacements running from 1 August – 31 December 2019. This promotion includes discounted prices on batteries and screens for a large range of Huawei smartphone models. As smartphones now typically have more expensive components than in previous years, these deals offer great value for those who need to replace their battery or their screen and are still satisfied with their current Huawei device. This allows them to extend the life of their smartphone and save money instead of buying a whole new device as a replacement. More information on these promotions can be viewed on the Huawei HiCare app. Huawei offers customers the option to replace both their screen and battery for only R699, including the cost of labour. The offer is valid for the following Huawei devices: If you are one of the careful few who have managed to keep your smartphone screen intact, but you have still noticed some natural degradation in battery performance, you can opt for a battery replacement at R199. Owners of a wide selection of smartphones from the Huawei Mate series, P-series, Y-series, and the Nova series are eligible for this promotion. The price also includes the cost of labour.
