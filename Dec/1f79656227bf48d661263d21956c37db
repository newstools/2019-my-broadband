South Africans could see a 5G smartphone launch locally sooner than expected – and it could come from Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo. Vivo recently entered into the South African market through the launch of two new mid-range devices, but the company said it has big plans for its future in the country. These plans include the launch of 5G smartphones in South Africa, which could be among the first of their kind in the country. “We hope to lead the 5G consumer pathway in South Africa,” said Vivo South Africa marketing director Hawa Hyath, who was speaking at the launch of the company’s Y-series smartphones in Johannesburg. Hyath said the 5G smartphones which Vivo planned to bring into South Africa would be part of its X-series hardware range and would be priced from around R10,000 and could launch as early as July 2020. She added that Vivo was in discussions with networks regarding the rollout of these devices. When it comes to competing in the South African market, Vivo has begun by launching two mid-range devices – the Y11 and the Y91C. The company aims to compete against Huawei and Samsung in the mid-range smartphone market space, as well as potentially roll out premium devices as its customer base grows. “VIVO is a hugely successful global brand that is known for its innovation and style,” Hyath said. “With global R&D centres, VIVO is consistently refining their offering to bring consumers the very best phone offering – in our pursuit of perfection we always aim to address user pain points thereby continuing to innovate and provide best user value.” “By launching ahead of the holiday season we are also giving consumers the choice to use the phones’ superlative cameras to capture holiday moments,” Hyath said. She added that the Vivo brand is aimed at younger customers and places a focus on innovation and style.
