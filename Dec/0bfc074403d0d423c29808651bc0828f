2019 was a good year for OfferZen, which saw it launch a large developer survey and the first phase of a programmable banking initiative. OfferZen, a recruitment platform for software developers in South Africa, told MyBroadband that it also focussed on working closer with its community and companies to “make South Africa a better place to be in tech”. “As the biggest tech talent marketplace in the country, with the biggest community of software developers, we have a vested interest in this mission,” said OfferZen. The company launched several initiatives during the year, which included: Two standout events from OfferZen in 2019 were its developer survey and the launch of programmable banking with Investec. “Over 3,000 developers in South Africa responded to our #SADevNationSurvey, which allowed us to put together the State of South Africa’s Software Developer Nation report.” “We also collaborated with Investec to help them build a programmable bank account for developers, a first step to enabling the tech community with financial systems access. The initial response has been overwhelmingly positive,” said OfferZen. This will provide programmable access to an Investec bank account, which includes access to a hosted code editor on the online banking platform. Bank account API access is also planned for the future – and will provide access to transactions and the ability to make payments via API.
