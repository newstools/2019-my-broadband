Qualcomm has announced two new Snapdragon processors for entry-level laptops that support Windows on ARM-based devices. The 7nm chips, the Snapdragon 8c and 7c, were revealed at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Tech Summit. These processors are aimed at affordable mainstream devices, such as Samsung’s Galaxy Book and budget Windows 10 notebooks. The Snapdragon 8c succeeds the Snapdragon 850, and comes with a Kryo 490 CPU, Adreno 675 GPU and X24 LTE modem – with the X55 5G modem as an alternative. Qualcomm claimed that the new chip boasts a 30% increase in performance over the Snapdragon 850. The Snapdragon 7c, meanwhile, employs a Kryo 468 processor, Adreno 618 graphics and the X15 LTE modem. It is intended for use in the cheapest Windows 10 devices. Tom’s Hardware noted that the 8c and 7c may drive developers to create more ARM-compatible apps for Windows 10, as the current selection is lacking. The new chips are less powerful than Qualcomm’s flagship computer processor, the Snapdragon 8cx. A variant of the 8cx known as the SQ1 is used in the Microsoft Surface Pro X. The SQ1’s performance was slammed in several reviews of the Microsoft device. It remains to be seen whether the 8cx will perform better in other upcoming devices, like the Samsung Book S and Lenovo’s Project Limitless 5G laptop.
