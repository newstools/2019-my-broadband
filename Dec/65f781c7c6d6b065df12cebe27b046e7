Police in Australia have rolled out cameras that capture photos of drivers who are using their phones illegally. The government in the state of New South Wales is using the cameras, which are connected to a system that employs artificial intelligence to flag photos of car occupants who appear to be using a phone or mobile device. The images are then manually reviewed by authorities to eliminate false positives. The New South Wales’s Centre for Road Safety stated that a trial application of the AI cameras captured more than 100,000 drivers guilty of illegal phone use. The centre estimated that the cameras could act as a deterrent that may prevent 100 fatal and serious injury crashed over five years. During the first three months of the plan, first-time infringers will receive a warning. Following this, the fine will be $344 AUD (R3,410) and five license demerit points, or $457 AUD (R4,530) in school zones, with 10 demerit points. Although South Africa’s traffic authorities do not currently use similar technology to capture offenders, South Africa’s Vumacam employs an AI camera system to identify unusual activities in suburbs and on roads. These cameras can be used to warn authorities and security companies about potential criminal activity, traffic flows, and road accidents.
