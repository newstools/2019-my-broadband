Earlier this year, Huawei launched its new Mate 30 Pro premium smartphone, which boasts cutting-edge hardware and an impressive new design. Huawei has implemented its “Horizon” display design on the Mate 30 Pro, which features a display panel that curves all the way around the front of the smartphone. The device’s launch followed shortly after Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10+ was unveiled, which is one of its competitors in the high-end market. The most apparent change with the Galaxy Note 10+ compared to its predecessor is its cutout front camera design, which trades the traditional notch for a similar design to the Galaxy S10. Huawei’s Mate 30 Pro retains the same notch as the previous-generation Mate 20 Pro, which houses a 32MP front-facing camera and the hardware necessary to facilitate Huawei’s Face ID 2.0 facial recognition feature. The device runs the EMUI 10 operating system, which is based on the latest version of Android, although it forgoes Google Mobile Services (GMS) for Huawei Mobile Services (HMS). This means that all third-party Android applications will work as normal on the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, and the device will have access to Huawei’s own ecosystem of applications and features. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10+ runs Android 9.0 with GMS support. Like the Mate 30 Pro, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ boasts a high-resolution AMOLED display that is almost bezel-less, and it features a quad-lens rear camera systems which includes a 3D time-of-flight lens to improve bokeh and zoom features. It also includes an S-Pen stylus, which is stored and charged in the chassis of the smartphone. Both the Mate 30 Pro and Galaxy Note 10+ also feature in-screen fingerprint sensors and the latest chipsets from their manufacturers. These devices offer high-end specifications across the board, from their massive batteries to their impressive high-resolution screens. The biggest difference between them, however, lies in their camera systems. While both handsets have quad-camera systems which include 3D TOF lenses, the Mate 30 Pro’s superior sensor and higher-resolution primary camera delivers better-quality images. This is according to DxOMark, which provides an industry standard for camera quality through its exhaustive tests and review scores. Huawei’s Mate 30 Pro sits at the top of the rankings at the time of writing, with a primary camera score of 121. This is compared to the Galaxy Note 10+’s camera score, which is 117. There is little separating both smartphones at this high level, but the Huawei Mate 30 Pro’s better camera and potentially cheaper price tag (it is not available in South Africa yet) could tip the scales in its favour in certain situations. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331834" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mate-30-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mate-30-Pro.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mate-30-Pro-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mate-30-Pro-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320617" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-3.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 30 Pro 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320609" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-2.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 30 Pro 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315847" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 10" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315845" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 10 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329813" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-Note-10.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-Note-10.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-Note-10-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-Note-10-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
