Motorola has launched its new One Hyper smartphone. The device falls somewhere between a mid-range and flagship handset, and it will ship with the latest version of Google’s mobile operating system, Android 10. The One Hyper’s display does not have a notch, as its 32MP front camera is housed in a pop-up mechanism on the top right of the device. On the rear of the phone, the dual-camera system consists of a 64MP wide lens and 8MP ultrawide sensor. The camera also supports Motorola’s AI software, allowing for low-light shots and intelligent photographic optimisation. The back of the phone sports a fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication. The Motorola One Hyper boasts one of Qualcomm’s most popular mid-range chips, the Snapdragon 675, paired with 4GB of RAM. The device has a 4,000mAh battery, which Motorola claims provides 38 hours of typical use between charges. It offers 128GB of internal storage, with a MicroSD slot that supports up to 1TB of expandable storage. The One Hyper is now available in the United States at $399 (R5,820).
