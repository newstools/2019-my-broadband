Registry Africa Limited (RA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ZACR, announced that it will offer .africa domains for $1 as part of its Asante promotion between February and March 2020. The promotion will see the wholesale price of .africa domains drop to $1 while the price of .joburg, .capetown, and .durban city domains will be reduced to R15. These prices exclude South African VAT where applicable. “With the number of registered .africa domains currently at 23,000, we are confident our much-anticipated $1.00 promotion will set .africa firmly on the path to the 25,000 domain name milestone,” said RA CEO Lucky Masilela. “Once again, the Asante Sana Promotion is aimed at saying thank you to the Registrars and Resellers (RaRs) that have largely been responsible for the phenomenal success of our African gTLDs.” RA encouraged its partners across the globe to pass on this wholesale saving of $1 per .africa domain name to their end-user clients and registrants. “The Fourth Industrial Revolution is being powered by information. Young Africans must fully participate in this digital revolution by being active and visible online and this can be achieved by registering a .africa domain,” Masilela said. RA said that a dedicated campaign microsite is available at asante.africa, which registrars can access to obtain the digital marketing collateral that they might need to help make the RA African gTLD promotion a success. “Our wholesale price promotion scheduled for February and March 2020 is our way of saying ‘Asante Sana’, or ‘thank you very much’ to our Registrars and Resellers who have contributed immensely to connect Africa to the world and the world to Africa. Together, we’re helping realise the dream of a Bright Continent,” Masilela added. The promotional campaign is for domain creates only. Premium names are excluded, and the promotional price is valid for one year only with renewals also excluded.
