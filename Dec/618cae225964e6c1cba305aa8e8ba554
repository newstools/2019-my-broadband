Black Friday took place on 29 December, and saw many South Africans shopping online. MyBroadband staff were no exception, and ordered discounted items from a range of local online stores. To see how well these stores coped with the load placed on them over this shopping week – the week of Black Friday to Cyber Monday, 2 December – we documented our orders and the subsequent delivery dates. The results of the test are detailed below. MyBroadband staff members placed orders from a range of online stores, and ordered a variety of items. The table below details the online store, the item which was purchased, when it was ordered, and when it was delivered. While certain orders had not been delivered at the time of writing, this was not unexpected. Stores including Makro, OneDayOnly, and Digicape stated at the time of ordering items that deliveries may only arrive in several days. Digicape and OneDayOnly, for example, stated that deliveries will take place within 5-10 working days after the order was placed. Makro and Game both stated on their online checkout pages that orders will take between 7-10 working days to be delivered. It must also be noted that of the orders received, all the correct items were shipped. The items were also received in good order, and no broken or damaged items were recorded by staff members.
