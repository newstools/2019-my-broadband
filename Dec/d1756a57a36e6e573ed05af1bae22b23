Japanese blog Macotakara reported that Apple will launch a budget iPhone in 2020 which will be named the iPhone 9. This budget smartphone has been rumoured for a long time and had been functionally known as the iPhone SE 2 due to the belief that it would be smaller and more affordable – much like the original iPhone SE. The new name is presumably based upon the expectation that the device’s design will be based on the iPhone 8. This includes a 4.7-inch LCD display and a home button with integrated Touch ID. The LCD display would make the iPhone 9 the only 2020 iPhone not to ship with an LED display. The device is expected to not include Face ID, and is aimed at users who wish for a smaller device similar to the older generation of iPhones. The iPhone 9 is expected to sport the company’s A13 bionic chip, but is expected to weaker specifications in other areas – such as offering 3GB RAM and a single-lens camera – to keep the device’s price low. The device will reportedly be priced at $399, making it substantially cheaper than any other modern iPhone. Softpedia believes that the iPhone 9 will launch in the first half of next year.
