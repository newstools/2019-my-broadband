The PC monitor market in South Africa showed declines over the last quarter, according to research from International Data Corporation (IDC). Despite this, the overall Middle East and Africa (MEA) PC monitor market saw year-over-year growth of 7.2% in units and 3.2% in value. IDC’s quarterly PC Monitors Tracker shows that overall shipments totalled 1.04 million units worth $160.55 million. “The Middle East and Africa experienced a successful quarter despite the region’s second-largest market, South Africa, suffering declines,” said IDC senior research analyst Nourhan Abdullah. “The revival in the regional market was mainly spurred by a rapid recovery in Turkey as a result of the Lira stabilizing against other currencies.” The top three vendors in MEA PC monitors market remained unchanged in Q3 2019, with Dell continuing to lead the way, followed by HP and LG Electronics. Shipments increase 27.1% YoY, with a large portion of this growth spurred by the strong performance of gaming monitors, which almost doubled in units sold compared to the same period last year. The commercial segment remained relatively flat with unit growth of just 0.5%. “Shipments of gaming monitors across MEA totalled 124,023 units worth $28.02 million in Q3 2019,” IDC said. “The top three brands in this space control 55.7% share of the market’s volume, with LG maintaining its lead ahead of Samsung in second place and AOC in third.” IDC said it expects the MEA PC monitors market to grow 10.7% YoY in units during Q4 2019 due to the strong performance of the Turkish market and increased sales during the Christmas and end-of-year period. In the long term, demand for PC monitors is expected to decline in favour of smartphones, laptops, and tablets.
