It’s been a great year for TV fans, especially if you have a lot of money to spend. The launch of Samsung’s 8K QLED TV was a definite highlight, along with the increasing prevalence and affordability of OLED panels. 4K is the new standard for TV resolution, and as high-speed broadband continues to become cheaper and more content becomes available through platforms such as Netflix and Showmax, it only makes sense to buy a high-end television. There are a number of great options available in South Africa from major brands like Samsung, LG, and Hisense. We looked at the best TV from each of these manufacturers that are available to buy in South Africa. Samsung launched its new QLED TVs in South Africa earlier this year, which were headlined by an impressive 8K range. The Q900 8K QLED TV is available in a number of sizes, up to a whopping 98-inch panel. The TV boasts AI-powered upscaling features in addition to HDR support and boasts a resolution of 7,680 x 4,320. This means that even if you are watching 4K content, it will look far better than on a standard 4K display thanks to the upscaling effect. The Samsung Q900 8K QLED TV is available in the following models: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303974" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900.jpg" alt="Samsung Q900" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> LG has an impressive collection of OLED TVs, headlined by the C8 range.
