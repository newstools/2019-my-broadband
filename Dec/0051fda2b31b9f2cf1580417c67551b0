Microsoft has officially revealed its next-generation Xbox console – the Xbox Series X. The company pulled the wraps off what it called its fastest and most-powerful gaming system during an announcement at the Game Awards yesterday. The new console has a simple rectangular build and looks similar to a small desktop PC, although it can also be placed and used horizontally. “Xbox Series X will be our fastest, most powerful console ever and set a new bar for performance, speed and compatibility, allowing you to bring your gaming legacy, thousands of games from three generations and more forward with you,” Microsoft said. The company claimed the industrial design of the Series X gives the new console four-times the processing power of the Xbox One X. This is thanks to a custom-built CPU from AMD. “Powered by our custom-designed processor leveraging the latest Zen 2 and next generation RDNA architecture from our partners at AMD, Xbox Series X will deliver hardware accelerated ray tracing and a new level of performance never before seen in a console,” Microsoft stated. The console will be able to run games in 4K at 60FPS, with the “possibility” of up to 120FPS. It will also have 8K capability, with variable refresh rate support. For quick loading times, the Series X will employ an NVMe SSD. The company did not reveal specifics about the console’s GPU, but Xbox CEO, Phil Spencer, has previously stated that the graphics processing power will be eight-times that of the Xbox One, or two-times that of the Xbox One X. Alongside the new console, Microsoft revealed a new wireless controller that will ship with the Series X. The remote will be slightly smaller and will sport a dedicated share button. It will be supported one existing Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs. The Xbox Series X is slated for a launch at the end of 2020, setting it up for a battle with Sony’s next console, the PlayStation 5.
