Eskom has announced that it will be implementing stage 2 load-shedding on Sunday between 09:00 and 23:00. This will follow stage 1 load-shedding that will take place between 23:00 on Saturday and 09:00 on Sunday. “The load-shedding is required overnight and all day to cater for further trips and to create capacity to replenish water reserves for our pumped storage schemes,” said Eskom. “Sufficient water and diesel reserves are necessary to limit the level of load-shedding in the coming week.” Eskom said that as of 19:00 on Saturday, unplanned breakdowns totaled 11,600MW, meaning that it was continuing to use water resources at its pumped storage systems to supplement capacity. However, the national power utility has not used any of its open cycle gas turbines on Saturday in order to conserve emergency reserves. Eskom asked customers to reduce their power usage as this will help to avoid or lessen the level of load-shedding. “As we are experiencing rainy and cooler weather conditions in some parts of the country, we ask that you use efficient heating to keep warm and switch off your geysers over peak periods.” Eskom said it will keep South Africans informed about the status of the electricity system and its recovery efforts. #POWERALERT 2
