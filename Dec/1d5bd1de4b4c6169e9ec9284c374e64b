Microsoft has added the ability to make phone calls from your Android smartphone via your Windows 10 device. “Today, we’re pleased to announce the general availability of the #YourPhone app Calls feature, which allows you to receive and make phone calls on your PC,” tweeted Microsoft. The Your Phone app is available for Windows 10 and Android, and allows users to link their smartphone to their Windows 10 device. This pairing functionality includes support for features such as texting, sharing and accessing files, and receiving and managing your phone’s notifications. Users can also mirror their device’s screen, allowing them to work on their Android smartphone without touching it. The software, which requires Android 7.0 or later to work, is available for free on the Microsoft Store. This feature could tempt some Windows 7 users to finally make the switch to Windows 10. Microsoft has been trying to convince these users to make the switch for months ahead of the end of support for the older operating system – which will take place on 14 January 2020. Recently, Microsoft announced that beginning 15 January, it will show Windows 7 users a full-screen notification that they should move to Windows 10. Despite months of decreasing market share, Windows 7’s adoption appears to be stabilising, with 26.86% of all desktop operating systems still using this old software.
