MTN has acknowledged a lawsuit filed against it by the families of US troops and contractors in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In a statement from MTN, the company said a complaint for the violation of the anti-terrorism act was filed on 27 December. “The complaint was filed on behalf of American service members and civilians, and their families, who were killed or wounded in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2017,” said MTN. “The complaint alleges that several Western businesses supported the Taliban by, inter alia, making payments to ensure the protection of their infrastructure.” “The defendants named in the complaint are six different groups one of which is MTN and certain of its subsidiary companies including MTN Afghanistan.” MTN told MyBroadband it has no additional comment on the matter at this stage. MTN said it is reviewing the details of the complaint and is consulting its advisers. However, it “remains of the view” that it conducts its business in “a responsible and compliant manner in all its territories”. It therefore intends to defend its position where necessary. The Wall Street Journal reported that the plaintiffs in the case are the families of 143 American troops and contractors who were killed or wounded. CNN reported that other defendants in the complaint were DAI Global, the Louis Berger Group, and Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp. The report added that not only is MTN accused of paying money to the Taliban, it also allegedly deactivated its cellular network at night at the Taliban’s request.
