Apple has launched iOS 13.3 and iPadOS 13.3 on all supported devices. The update brings several significant changes, including improvements to the Screen Time feature, which allows parents to set monitor how their children use their devices. Parents will now be able to set limits on their childrenâ€™s Messages and FaceTime usage, as well as who their children may communicate with. The new update will also see layout changes being implemented for certain publications on Apple News+. Additionally, iOS and iPadOS 13.3 add support for NFC, USB, and Lightning FIDO2-compliant security keys in Safari. Fixes have also been implemented for the Mail app, while some wireless chargers which were not operating as efficiently as intended have also received a fix. The update can be downloaded through the Settings app by navigating to General > Software Update. WhatsApp is working on bringing dark mode functionality to its iOS app, as spotted in the beta version of the messaging platform as far back as October 2018. Last month, WABetaInfo found that WhatsApp was reworking its iOS dark mode feature, and was now testing two different modes. One dark theme configuration uses deep black colours, while the other uses slightly lighter shades.
