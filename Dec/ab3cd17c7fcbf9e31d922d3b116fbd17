FNB has expanded its app-based payment ecosystem by adding more QR code payment channels in South Africa. From 1 December 2019, customers can now make QR code payments when shopping or filling up at Engen service stations across the country. FNB said this would be the first phase of its expanded QR code roll-out, with support for the payment method soon to be introduced at major retailers across the country. “We are fortunate in that our market leader position and continued digitisation of our banking platform enables us to benefit from scale,” said FNB Merchant Services CEO Thokozani Dlamini. “Consequently, we are able to reach a significant number of merchants in SA, while providing them with industry-leading and affordable banking solutions.” “This coupled with our initial partnership with Engen, which has the largest service station footprint in South Africa, will go a long way in helping us to accelerate the adoption of digital payment solutions in the country,” Dlamini said. FNB’s QR code payment system is powered by Masterpass, and it has seen impressive adoption, with double-digit monthly growth since its launch on the FNB App. “We continuously strive to improve our payments solutions and enhance our customers experience by providing them a range of solutions that are secure and convenient when making purchases,” Dlamini said.
