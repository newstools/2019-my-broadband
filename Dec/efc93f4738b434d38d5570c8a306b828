Like many people in the modern workplace, I rely heavily on my smartphone for informative notifications and rapid communication. This is especially true when I’m out of the office, whether I’m at an event or just out and away from my laptop. In addition to syncing my email with my Gmail account and enabling notifications for these messages, my phone’s Android operating system is also connected to my Google account, which means it has access to my bookmarks, notification preferences, and the passwords I have stored in Google’s password locker. On Windows PCs, this functionality only exists through the Google Chrome browser, and in most instances, this makes Chrome the only application I need on my laptop at any given time. For this reason, I was excited when Acer provided us with the Chromebook Spin 13 to review and, after trying out this device, I am convinced that it is a great fit for modern professionals. Immediately upon starting up the Acer Chromebook Spin 13, I was struck by the familiarity of Chrome OS’s setup process. It was very much like setting up an Android smartphone, although I had the advantage of a keyboard and trackpad in addition to a touch screen. Once this is complete, you are presented with a basic desktop screen and a single taskbar which offers Google Docs, YouTube, Chrome, Gmail, and the Google Play Store. This taskbar reflects what applications you have open, and allows you to instantly access the most important Google apps at a single touch. It is immediately apparent when using the Acer Chromebook Spin 13 that its software offers enough functionality for most daily usage, but it’s the connected Google account experience which takes it to the next level. Using the same Google account on a Chromebook and a smartphone means you can effortlessly share files across both devices, as well as access all your emails and other communication. The Acer Chromebook Spin 13 is a great device, and its Chrome OS platform delivers a responsive and powerful collection of applications, with hardly any compromises compared to a standard work experience on a Windows laptop. The Acer Chromebook Spin 13 is a Chromebook that packs a serious amount of performance, thanks to its Intel 8th-generation processor and high-speed flash storage. It’s also an extremely slim and lightweight device with excellent battery life, making it an ideal companion for professionals who need a portable workstation. The most impressive components of the Acer Chromebook Spin 13 are its high-resolution display and its stylus, which is sheathed within the lower chassis of the laptop. It’s 13.5-inch IPS LCD display has an impressive 2,566 x 1,504 resolution, making the device great for streaming media as well as fine drawing work with the included stylus. Acer has fitted its Chromebook Spin 13 with all the components needed for a great professional laptop, while also delivering a slim and portable machine which can sync easily with your Android smartphone. Provided you have an Internet connection wherever you are working – or mobile data and a smartphone that can act as a hotspot – the Acer Chromebook Spin 13 is a fantastic portable notebook with excellent battery life and impressive integration with Google’s cloud platform. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331075"
