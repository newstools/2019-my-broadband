While 2019 has seen the launch of numerous high-end graphics cards, mid-range GPUs from Nvidia and AMD are still popular among South African gamers. This is according to local PC hardware retailers. The GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card was launched by Nvidia in January, offering great value in the mid-range market. Nvidia also launched its more affordable graphics cards – the GTX 1650 and GTX 1660 – in March and April respectively. In July, Nvidia then added Super editions of its GTX 2060, 2070, and 2080 graphics cards to its range of high-performance GPUs. AMD also launched a variety of new graphics cards to compete with Nvidia in 2019. The Radeon VII is a competitor to Nvidia’s RTX 2080, although there were significant issues with a lack of stock being provided to South African distributors. In June, AMD launched the RX 5700 and 5700 XT graphics cards, which compete with the RTX 2060 and 2070 respectively. Raru told MyBroadband that its best-selling GPUs for 2019 were the mid-range 10-series cards. “Their relatively affordable price and power increase in that tier has made for some really good price-to-performance cards.” The GTX 1660 is an upgrade of the GTX 1060, and offers improved gaming while still coming in at under R5,000. Nvidia’s GTX 1650 is an upgrade of the GTX 1050 and offers a 70% increase in performance while only drawing 75W of power – making it great for budget builds. Wootware told MyBroadband that the RX 570 4GB graphics card from AMD was extremely popular this year. “The RX 570 4GB from AMD has had a very strong showing throughout the year, due to it topping many price-performance charts for 1080p gaming,” said Wootware. The RX 570 is available for under R3,000, making it a great budget graphics card for new gamers. AMD’s RX 580 is another great option for gamers looking for budget graphics cards, as it offers high-quality performance for just a few hundred rand extra. Wootware also highlighted that various higher-end graphics cards were highly regarded by customers. “Nvidia’s Super series refresh has been incredibly popular, with the 2070 Super being the most popular out of the range. More recently, AMD’s 5700 XT series of graphics cards have also been a hit with customers.” The RTX 2070 Super competes at a similar level to the RTX 2080 despite costing less. The 5700 XT, meanwhile, competes with the original RTX 2070 and offers great value as it is available for under R8,000.
