Link Africa has expanded its wholesale fibre network through the acquisition of a leading ISP’s fibre network. MyBroadband asked Link Africa which company it had acquired its additional nationwide fibre optic network from, but it said it was unable to respond. Link Africa also did not state how much it had paid for the fibre network acquisition. The company’s network now has over 400 points of presence across South Africa and reaches 8,500km, making it one of the biggest network providers in the country alongside Openserve, Liquid Telecom, and Dark Fibre Africa. “The BBBEE level 1 contributor status of Link Africa will provide an unparalleled platform to partner with its private and public sector clients to drive growth and transformation of the South African digital economy,” Link Africa said in a statement. Link Africa CEO Terence Moodley said that this acquisition transforms Link Africa into a key player in the South African fibre market. “It also provides a platform for our clients to expand GSM coverage in metropolitan and major towns across all provinces, improves our fibre coverage in most major commercial and retail centres across the country and will help provide substantially more affordable fibre services,” Moodley said. “This deal also positions Link Africa in a strategically excellent position as 5G and the government-supported Wholesale Open Access Network (WOAN) looms ever larger on the horizon.” He said that Link Africa’s fibre network clients will continue to experience the same high levels of service, with the added benefit that Link Africa will have a far wider reach. Link Africa added that it would make further investment into the expansion of its fibre network to expand its portfolio of wholesale services.
