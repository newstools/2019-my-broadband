Capitec has launched a mobile game named Livin’ it Up. The game is designed to let users test their money skills in a virtual world so that they can invest and save better in real life. Players are required to use money management strategies to deal with work and life events, including load-shedding, while trying to save enough money to achieve their characters’ long-term goals. “Users play as different characters, all trying to achieve typical financial goals South Africans are striving to save for – like putting a sister through university or buying a car,” said Capitec. Jean Rossouw, Head of Financial Education at Capitec Bank, said that the bank wants people to think differently about their money while simultaneously having fun. “The emphasis is on how you plan and prioritise your spending to balance your immediate ‘wants’ with the dreams you have for your future,” said Rossouw. The game was built by games and animation solutions provider Sea Monster. Sea Monster CEO Glenn Gillis said that Livin’ it Up is the most important game the company has made. “Gaming allows the audience to become the character. By giving people agency and a safe space to learn, messages are subtly imparted and resonate deeply,” said Gillis. Livin’ it Up is free to download and play, and is available for both Android and iOS.
