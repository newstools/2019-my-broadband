Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has reversed the appointment of Newyear Ntuli as administrator of USAASA, according to a report by EWN. The report stated that the minister made the decision after EWN informed her department about “misconduct” allegations against Ntuli by employees at his previous employer – the SA Post Office (SAPO). It added that Ntuli resigned from his position at SAPO, and Ndabeni-Abrahams was not aware of any allegations against him. This is despite SAPO forming part of her department’s portfolio. Ntuli was named as administrator of USAASA during the minister’s recent overhaul of several government and regulatory agencies, and was set to start at USAASA on 1 January 2020. The overhaul included the merging of ZADNA, ICASA, and the FPB – and the merger of Sentech and Broadband Infraco – and was announced on 19 December 2019. USAASA – the Universal Service and Access Agency of South Africa – is an SOE whose goal is to “ensure that every man, woman, and child, whether living in the remote areas of the Kalahari or in urban areas of Gauteng, can be able to connect, speak, explore, and study using ICTs”.
