Windows 10 Mobile will receive its final set of updates today, after which the mobile operating system will officially be deemed unsupported. This applies to all Windows 10 Mobile products, including Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise. “Windows 10 Mobile users will no longer be eligible to receive new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free assisted support options or online technical content updates from Microsoft for free,” Microsoft said. Since Windows 10 Mobile is the final version of the Windows mobile operating system, this means that Microsoft will officially remove itself from the mobile operating system market. Windows 10 Mobile has been all but dead for a long time already, but it has been continued to be supported with updates. Microsoft recommends that users instead use Android or iOS for their smartphones, as the company believes that these operating systems are where users will get the most frequent and in-depth updates – even for Microsoft’s own apps. The company announced on Friday that it would also be cancelling all support for Microsoft Office apps on Windows 10 Mobile. “Microsoft remains committed to providing a great Office experience on phones for consumer, commercial, education, and government users through the iOS and Android apps which continue to be supported,” said the company.
