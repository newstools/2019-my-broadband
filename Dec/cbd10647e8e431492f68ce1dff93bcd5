Teraco CEO Lex van Wyk is stepping down at the end of the month, the company has announced. Van Wyk’s role as CEO will be taken up by Jan Hnizdo, who has been an executive director at Teraco since 2011. Teraco was started by Tim Parsonson and Lex van Wyk in 2008 with the idea of offering vendor-neutral data centres in South Africa, and van Wyk has been CEO since 2013. “Since launching, Teraco has established itself as the largest provider of data centre colocation space in Africa, with more than 50MW of available critical power load,” said Teraco. “As the first vendor-neutral data centre in Africa, Teraco also launched Africa’s largest Internet exchange, NAPAfrica, in 2012. This changed the way the African continent accessed content, while also making the Internet more easily available and at a significantly-reduced cost.” “It has been an honour for me to help build such a phenomenal business, but after 11 years, I feel that the timing is right to step aside,” said van Wyk. He added that Hnizdo’s placement as CEO has been carefully planned over the last few years. “The current management team is focused and stays in place with the same goals. Importantly, Jan has been an outstanding part of the leadership team and has played an integral role in Teraco’s success over the past nine years,” said the company. “During this period, we have grown revenue 20 times and Teraco has moved from a startup phase to the leading position that we enjoy today.” Van Wyk will remain a shareholder in Teraco and will continue to serve on the board in the capacity of non-executive director.
