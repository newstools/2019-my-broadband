Vodacom has announced that South Africans can now purchase locally-built Mara smartphones at participating outlets. Mara Phones opened its first South African manufacturing plant in Durban in October, from where it produces two high-quality budget smartphones – the Mara Z and Mara X. Terminals Managing Executive at Vodacom, Davide Tacchino, said that the network is proud to be associated with the devices. “Vodacom is proud to offer the ‘Made in Africa’ Mara smartphones to our customers, not only because it provides South Africans with the opportunity to connect to the things that matter most to them, but also because this supports our commitment to African innovation,” said Tacchino. CEO of Mara Phones Ashish J. Thakkar stated that the company is grateful to Vodacom for its support of the Mara product. “Mara phones offer an opportunity to create a strong mobile device sector in the country which would lead to economic growth & job creation. We are appreciative to Vodacom for their commitment and support to Mara Phones and look forward to building on this solid partnership from strength to strength,” Thakkar said. The Mara Z is the higher-end option, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 CPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB storage, and 13MP cameras on the rear and front. It runs on the Android 9.0 mobile operating system and retails at R3,999. The cheaper Mara X sports a Mediatek MT6739 processor, 1GB of RAM, 16GB storage, a 13MP rear, and 5MP front camera. It runs Android 9.0 Go and is priced at R2,999.
