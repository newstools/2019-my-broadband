Dear Santa. I have been very well behaved this year and I would like you to bring me several presents for Christmas. Please note that the gifts are all components for my gaming PC, and therefore I will need them delivered before 25 December to ensure I get maximum holiday-gaming time. You are welcome to deliver the items on 14 December, my first day of leave. I do not have a chimney, but the braai outside has one. Feel free to use this for a dramatic entrance. Please also feel free to clean the braai grill while you are there. My list is below. With 8 cores and 16 threads, and a 4.4GHz turbo mode, the Ryzen 7 3700X will be the foundation of the gaming PC. Please do not confuse the Ryen 7 with a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 3 – I know old people are prone to this. Even more importantly, do not give me a Ryzen 2700X. I need third-gen, Santa. In fact, just print this article, show it to the salesperson at the shop, and point to the picture below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331346" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ryzen-7.jpg" alt="Ryzen 7" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ryzen-7.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ryzen-7-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ryzen-7-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Santa, this very important. The MSI RTX 2080 Ti. Not the RTX 2080. Not the RTX 2080 Super. The RTX 2080 Ti. It must also be the MSI Gaming X Trio version, as it has RGB lighting and a cool backplate. So help me Santa, if you bring me the MSI Ventus OC version instead of the Gaming X Trio I will make you go back to the North Pole. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331362" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RTX-2080.jpg" alt="RTX 2080" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RTX-2080.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RTX-2080-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/RTX-2080-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> To house these new components, I will need a new case. Think of the PC case like your sleigh – it must look good, be strong, and have lots of cooling so that the presents do not overheat. Keeping in the Christmas spirit, I will take a red NZXT H700 case. Please handle with care, as the tempered glass side panel cannot have any scratches on it. Please also do not touch the case after eating chips/toasted sandwich/food that gives you greasy fingers. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331374" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NZXT.jpg" alt="NZXT" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NZXT.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NZXT-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NZXT-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This one will be simple for you. A 34-inch widescreen, 100Hz refresh rate, and G-Sync support – obviously, as I will have an Nvidia card and FreeSync won’t sync to keep games in sync. I won’t be greedy and ask for 4K, so 3,440 x 1,440 will be okay. A slight curve is important to ensure equidistant eye distance from the screen, with an IPS display backlit by LEDs ensuring the image is clean. And make sure it comes with a South African plug. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331378" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ASUS-Monitor.jpg" alt="ASUS Monitor" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ASUS-Monitor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ASUS-Monitor-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ASUS-Monitor-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> That is it for 2019. I think this list has been a considered and conservative one, and should not be a problem for you. Next year I will ask for liquid cooling, LED-covered M.2 SSDs, and a new keyboard and mouse. All the best. Staff Writer.
