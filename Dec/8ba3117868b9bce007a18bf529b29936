LG has revealed its upcoming line-up of thin-and-light Gram laptops for 2020. The range includes four builds – a 17-inch, 15-inch, 14-inch and a 2-in-1-convertible. Gram laptops are designed to be lightweight and compact with long battery life, and LG said that the new generation will add better performance to the mix. The 2020 line-up of LG’s Gram laptops will boast 10th-generation Intel processors and up to 24GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM. With Iris Plus graphics, LG claimed these will boast double the graphics processing power of the previous-generation laptops. The 17-inch and 15-inch models will get an 80Wh battery, while the 14-inch and convertible models sport 72Wh packs. All of the devices will support the new Wi-Fi 6 standard, which allows for better connectivity and power efficiency. No release date or pricing has been announced, but more information may be revealed when LG displays the new laptops at CES in January 2020.
