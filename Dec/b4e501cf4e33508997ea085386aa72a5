The flagship 2021 iPhone will have no charging port, 9to5Mac reports. This is according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who previously made several correct predictions for unreleased Apple devices. If Kuo’s report is to be believed, the top-of-the-range iPhone set to launch in 2021 will do away with Apple’s proprietary Lightning port and switch to a “completely wireless experience”. Although the leak does not reveal how users would be able to charge the phone, iPhone models have featured Qi wireless charging capability since 2017. Apple would likely have to ship the phone with a wireless charging pad if it plans to rely entirely on wireless charging. The report does not detail any plans to switch the iPhone’s connection type from lightning to USB-C. Apple started using USB-C in its iPad Pro in 2018, which lead to anticipation that the company would eventually introduce the widely-used standard in the iPhone. In September, Kuo also leaked details about a successor to Apple’s budget iPhone SE coming in 2020. That device could feature the same chassis as the iPhone 8 with a 4.7-inch screen. Kuo predicted that Apple will follow this device up with another budget offering the following year which will be named the iPhone SE2 Plus. The iPhone SE2 Plus will boast a larger all-screen display of either 5.5 or 6.1 inches.
