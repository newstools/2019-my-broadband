Developers have successfully installed Windows 10 on flagship mobile devices, WindowsLatest reports. Microsoft has been working with Qualcomm on a version of Windows 10 for ARM which would be able to run on mobile chipsets, and developers have already managed to load the operating system onto a number of devices. A developer with the alias Leon1Ice confirmed on Twitter that he installed Windows 10 ARM on a OnePlus 6 smartphone and was working to port the software to the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S. Loading Windows 10 ARM on the OnePlus 6 required the installation of drivers for Lenovo’s Always Connected Yoga C630 laptop, and only basic touch functionality is available through this workaround. Developers have also managed to install the operating system on the Google Pixel 3XL, OnePlus 6T, and the Samsung Galaxy S8, with varying degrees of success. Microsoft’s Windows 10 for ARM has been implemented on its new Surface Pro X 2-in-1 device, which runs a proprietary chipset developed in partnership with Qualcomm. The ARM processor allows the Surface Pro X to boast better battery life while maintaining performance, but it does lack compatibility with many Windows 10 apps. Microsoft is working with developers to help them port their x86 Windows apps to ARM64 devices, which means that the number of applications able to run on Windows 10 ARM should increase in future.
