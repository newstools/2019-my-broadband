2019 was a bruising for South Africans. Load-shedding returned with a vengeance, SAA was placed under business rescue, and the economy continued to struggle. Despite these challenging conditions, South Africa’s technology and telecommunications market remained vibrant. Rain launched the country’s first commercial 5G service in September, Telkom tried to buy Cell C, and MultiChoice listed on the JSE. This year also saw the highly anticipated launch of Discovery Bank and Remgro making a big play in the telecoms market through CIVH. 2019 was also a busy year in the international arena, with Huawei getting caught in the middle of a trade war and Google’s founders stepping down from their position as executives at the company. This year also saw Facebook announcing its digital currency initiative called Libra, and WeWork’s failed listing, which exposed how much trouble the company really is in.
