South Africa boasts some of the best mobile networks in Africa, and MyBroadband recently conducted drive tests to see exactly how good these networks are. These drive tests were conducted in South Africa’s 4 major metros – The City of Tshwane, The City of Johannesburg, The City of Cape Town, and eThekwini Municipality. The network tests were conducted using a specialised network testing vehicle with high-end smartphones which ran a custom version of MyBroadband’s Android Speed Test app. To ensure we were able to test the latest technologies which were available on the cellular networks, we used three of the latest phones: The results showed that MTN had the fastest average download speed across all four metro areas, closely followed by Vodacom in second place. Telkom placed third in all metro areas. The detailed drive test results for each metropolitan area are listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332538" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Devices.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Devices.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Devices-600x317.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332542" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pretoria.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pretoria.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pretoria-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pretoria-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332544" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pretoria-graph.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pretoria-graph.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pretoria-graph-600x240.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332546" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Johannesburg.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Johannesburg.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Johannesburg-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Johannesburg-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332548" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Johannesburg-graph.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Johannesburg-graph.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Johannesburg-graph-600x240.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332550" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cape-Town.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cape-Town.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cape-Town-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cape-Town-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332552" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cape-Town-graph.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cape-Town-graph.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cape-Town-graph-600x240.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332554" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Durban.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Durban.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Durban-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Durban-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-332556" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Durban-graph.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Durban-graph.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Durban-graph-600x240.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
