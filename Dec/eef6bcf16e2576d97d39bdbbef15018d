Smartphone cameras have become so advanced that they can replace DSLR cameras in many situations, offering everything from impressive optical zoom to great colour ranges and HDR capabilities. Manufacturers are constantly working to improve their handsets’ camera offerings, and it has now become common to see high megapixel counts and 3D depth-sensing features on flagship devices. If the quality of your smartphone camera is important to you, and you are undecided about which of this year’s smartphones to buy, DxOMark has released its rankings across various photography categories to help inform your decision. The DxOMark camera scoring system is one of the best indicators of a smartphone camera’s performance and is employed across the industry to compare the quality of mobile camera systems. DxOMark tested 31 smartphone main cameras in 2019, noting that manufacturers have made great strides in improving their camera scores over the past year. Overall, the Huawei Mate 30 Pro and Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro Premium Edition top the DxOMark rankings, making them the best choices for consumers looking for great photography features in any situation.
