Samsung recently refreshed its lineup of Galaxy A Series devices with the launch of its Galaxy A30s and Galaxy A50s handsets, which add even more features while shipping at around the same price as the previous versions. The most impressive of these two devices is the Samsung Galaxy A30s, due to its attractively-low price tag and flagship-level specifications. Unlike most other smartphones in the R4,000 – R5,000 price range, the Galaxy A30s boasts a powerful camera system, OLED display, and an in-screen fingerprint sensor. It is also a great-looking device, with a full-screen notched display and a prismatic holographic pattern on the back. Samsung provided MyBroadband with a Samsung Galaxy A30s to review, and we were blown away by the mid-range smartphone’s features. The Samsung Galaxy A30s is an attractive handset – it sports an OLED display with a fingerprint sensor underneath and a chassis design that mirrors flagship trends. Its camera system is also very impressive, comprising a 25MP primary sensor and two other lenses on the back paired with a 16MP selfie camera. Samsung has also packed great memory specifications into its mid-range device, with the Galaxy A30s boasting 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. For its price, the Samsung Galaxy A30s is one of the best smartphones available on the market. It offers a ton of flagship features, including support for Samsung Pay, while maintaining an extremely attractive price tag. The device’s camera app includes a selection of intelligent shooting modes, such as Live Focus, ultra-wide shooting, Selfie Focus, and Smart Beauty. On the performance side, the Galaxy A30s pairs a Samsung Exynos octa-core chipset with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. These memory specifications are on par with many flagships, which is impressive in a device the third of the price. This hardware translates to a great gaming experience too, with the device’s built-in Game Booster functionality learning how you use your smartphone to optimise battery life and performance. Battery life is great on the Samsung Galaxy A30s thanks to the 4,000mAh cell it packs into its thin chassis with 15W fast charging support. If you are concerned about security, the Galaxy A30s has you covered. Thanks to the inclusion of Samsung’s Knox platform, the device can secure your files, Samsung Pay data, and other information using the in-screen fingerprint sensor to verify your identity. Samsung’s Galaxy A30s is available from many retailers in South Africa and is priced from R4,495. Below are the full specifications of the Samsung Galaxy A30s provided to MyBroadband. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-329861" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-1-clean-640x430.jpg" alt="Galaxy A30s 1 clean" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-1-clean-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-1-clean-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-1-clean-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-1-clean-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-1-clean-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-1-clean.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-329863" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-2-clean-640x430.jpg" alt="Galaxy A30s 2 clean" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-2-clean-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-2-clean-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-2-clean-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-2-clean-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-2-clean-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-2-clean.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-329859" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-header-1-640x430.jpg" alt="Galaxy A30s header 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-header-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-header-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-header-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-329855" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-6-640x430.jpg" alt="Galaxy A30s 6" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-6-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-6-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-6-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-6-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-6-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-6.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-329853" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-5-640x430.jpg" alt="Galaxy A30s 5" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-5-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-5-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-5-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-5-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-5-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Galaxy-A30s-5.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
