MTN has released a statement to investors in reply to the Competition Commission’s Data Services Market Enquiry report. “We respectfully disagree with the analysis and recommendations contained in the summary report and, as we study the full report, will continue to engage constructively and vigorously defend against over broad and intrusive recommendations,” said MTN. This comes after the report stated that Vodacom and MTN must cut data prices by 50% and give users free mobile data. “The detailed report from the Competition Commission is yet to be released. We are currently studying the summary report and will not be able to comment in more detail until we have seen the full
document,” said MTN. MTN said its South African business has substantially reduced the effective price of data in the country, and has invested heavily in its network to accommodate growing data demand with limited spectrum availability. “MTN Group has invested over R50 billion in the South African network in the last five years and has pledged a further R50 billion of investment over the next five years as part of delivering a world-class network for all South Africans.” “We remain committed to providing high quality, affordable data and connectivity to our customers in all our markets. We will continue with our pricing transformation initiatives across all our markets,” it added. MTN reiterated that the release of new spectrum will assist its ability to service more customers with more data.
