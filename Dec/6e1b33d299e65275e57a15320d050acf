ICASA has announced it is investigating the impact of the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter regulations. “ICASA is seeking public comments and submissions on the published notice of intention to conduct a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations,” said the regulatory body. “The outcome of this impact assessment would assist the Authority to better understand whether the amendment Regulations achieved the Authority’s expectations.” Those wishing to submit public comment in relation to the regulations must do so within thirty working days of the date of the notice’s publication. The End-User and Subscriber Service Charter was amended by ICASA in February 2019. These regulations require mobile operators to roll over unused data, prevent automatic out-of-bundle data billing, and allow for data transfers between customers. The changes also require that mobile operators provide consumers with an option to opt out of usage depletion notifications for voice, SMS, and data services. ICASA highlighted that these regulations do not apply to entities such as MVNOs and resellers. MTN previously told MyBroadband that there could be confusion down the line as a result of how the regulations have been written. “The regulations apply to all licensed operators. In respect of consumer services, this could create confusion with respect to licence-exempt resellers and MVNOs.”
