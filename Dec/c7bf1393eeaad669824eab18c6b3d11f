Research by Kaspersky has found a number of issues with biometric security which could have negatively affected the confidentiality and integrity of fingerprint recognition systems. This is due to the prevalence of malware used to attack biometric processing systems, which have been proven to have significant shortcomings. “Biometric data is increasingly part of everyday life, augmenting and replacing traditional authentication methods, such as those based on logins and passwords,” Kaspersky said. “However, like many other technologies that have lately been rapidly evolving, biometric authentication systems have proved to have significant generic drawbacks.” With that in mind, Kaspersky security experts conducted research into cyberthreats that targeted computers used to collect, process, and store biometric data with Kaspersky products installed in the first nine months of 2019. They found that 37% of the systems included in the research faced at least one attempt of malware infection. “An analysis of threat sources has shown that the Internet is the main source of threats for biometric data processing systems – threats with this source were blocked on 14.4% of all biometric data processing systems,” Kaspersky said. “This category includes threats blocked on malicious and phishing websites, along with web-based email services.” A graph detailing the main sources of threats for biometric data processing and storage systems is shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-332010" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kaspersky-biometric-threats-640x385.jpg" alt="Kaspersky biometric threats" width="640" height="385" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kaspersky-biometric-threats-640x385.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kaspersky-biometric-threats-600x361.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kaspersky-biometric-threats-768x463.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kaspersky-biometric-threats.jpg 875w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “Our research shows that the existing situation with biometric data security is critical and needs to be brought to the attention of industry and government regulators, the community of information security experts, and the general public,” said Kaspersky ICS CERT senior security expert Kirill Kruglov. “Though we believe our customers are cautious, we need to emphasise that infection caused by the malware we detected and prevented could have negatively affected the integrity and confidentiality of biometric processing systems.” “This is particularly the case for databases where biometric data is stored, if those systems were not protected,” Kruglov said. To defend against cyberattacks, Kaspersky advised the following:
