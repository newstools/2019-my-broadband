Internet Solutions has sold its fibre network assets to Link Africa, the company has confirmed. Link Africa announced the acquisition earlier today, but declined to state which company it bought the fibre assets from. Neither Link Africa nor Internet Solutions (IS) were willing to disclose how much the deal is worth. “Internet Solutions confirms it has sold its fibre assets to Link Africa for an undisclosed sum,” an Internet Solutions spokesperson said. “The transaction is in line with the company’s strategy to disinvest in certain Layer 1 and 2 assets as it refocuses its investments to software-defined technologies.” “The company will continue to provide fibre services to its clients through its strategic partnerships with Link Africa and other fibre providers,” Internet Solutions said. With the acquisition, Link Africa said that its network now has over 400 points of presence across South Africa and reaches 8,500km. Link Africa stated that this makes it one of the biggest network providers in the country alongside Openserve, Liquid Telecom, and Dark Fibre Africa. “This deal also positions Link Africa in a strategically excellent position as 5G and the government-supported Wholesale Open Access Network looms ever larger on the horizon,” said Link Africa CEO Terence Moodley. Moodley said that Link Africa’s fibre network clients will continue to experience the same high levels of service, with the added benefit that Link Africa will have a far wider reach.
