Cell C has been under significant strain this past year, but the company said it has seen success in the second half of 2019. After posting an R8-billion loss and being forced to implement a radical turnaround strategy, it has made steps towards recovery. “Cell C has certainly had a rough start to the year, but a significantly-improved second half with some great successes,” Cell C told MyBroadband. The company said it was proud of the initiatives it had launched, as well as the success of signing an extended roaming agreement with MTN. Cell C said the implementation of the expanded roaming agreement was its biggest success of 2019. “Our biggest success for the year was the finalisation of the extended MTN roaming agreement and the implementation of our turnaround strategy, which so far is showing promising results, under the leadership of our CEO, Douglas Craigie Stevenson, who was appointed earlier in the year,” Cell C said. In addition to this progress, Cell C said it also valued the awards it had received over the past year, and its various social responsibility initiatives. “Our win at the Ask Afrika Orange Index for the Overall Telecommunications Industry Award for the second year in a row was a testament to our commitment to put our customers first,” the company said. “Just confirming that was topping the BrandsEye report for customer service and consumer positivity. One of the projects we are really proud of is the launch of our Innovation Challenge, which will help bolster the small business sector in the ICT arena.” “Our Wi-Fi project offering public access Wi-Fi to citizens all over Cape Town and the Free State has also been a great success,” Cell C added. Additionally, the company also won several Loerie awards for its marketing campaigns.
