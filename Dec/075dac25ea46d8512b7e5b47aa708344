Eskom has announced that stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented today, 5 December 2019, from 16:00 until 23:00. “Eskom regrets that Stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented from 16:00 to 23:00 today due to a shortage of capacity,” it said. The struggling power utility has managed to avoid load-shedding for almost a month, with the last controlled blackouts being implemented early in November. Load-shedding has been a lingering threat in South Africa since Eskom’s systems collapsed in the first quarter of the year. This new bout of load-shedding follows after Eskom permanently shut down several power generation units at older power stations due to its inability to fix them. This also hampered the power utility’s available electrical capacity to meet demand, which increased the risk of load-shedding going forward. Eskom did not clarify on what had changed since the power utility posted on Twitter this morning that it expected no load-shedding today. #PowerAlert Eskom regrets that Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 16:00 to 23:00 today due to a shortage of capacity. @CityPowerJhb @City_Ekurhuleni @CityTshwane @CityofCT @eThekwiniM @SABCNewsOnline @ewnupdates @IOL @eNCA @SAgovnews @News24 @SowetanLIVE — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) December 5, 2019
