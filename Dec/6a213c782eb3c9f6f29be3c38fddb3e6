Huawei’s Watch GT 2 is a formidable entry to the market, with features and a price that deserves the attention of South African consumers. Huawei has kept pace with the massive growth in the smart wearable market in recent years, and unveiled the second generation of its flagship Watch GT in September 2019. I had never understood the appeal of a smartwatch, but after several days with Huawei’s Watch GT 2 – which was provided to us by Huawei – I was converted. The Watch GT 2 comes in two sizes – 42mm and 46mm. The first sports a 1.2-inch 390 x 390 OLED touch display, while the latter has a 1.39-inch 454 x 454 screen. The watch models are also available in a variety of designs, with a range of easily-interchangeable Quickfit wristband types to choose from. Material types for these include leather, metal, milanese, and fluoroelastomer. I had the 42mm Watch GT 2 Sport, fitted with a Night Black case and black fluoroelastomer strap, and it was a very slick-looking device. The look is understated but stylish, making it ideal to wear on any occasion. The Watch GT 2 features two physical buttons on the right side of the watch’s face. The top button can be held down to turn the device on and off or pressed to open a scrollable menu. The bottom button serves as a quick-access shortcut and can be programmed to open applications within the settings menu. The AMOLED touch display is bright and allows for easy viewing, as well as quick and fluid navigation with swipes and touches that were responsive. By default, the display lights up when the wearer lifts their wrist and turns the watch to their face. However, an always-on setting is also available. Users can then select from one of 25 free watch faces through the Huawei Health store app. The Huawei Health app makes the integration between the Watch GT 2 and any Android or iOS smartphone seamless. The syncing process is simple to perform, and I encountered no issues with getting the device to work with my smartphone, which was running Android 9.0. In-depth information about your activities, optimised control over notifications, and easy firmware updates are all available in the app. Once synced with your phone, the watch employs vibrations for alerts such as messages, incoming phone calls, and app notifications. Wearers are also able to monitor their heart rate, the weather in their area, number of steps taken, distances covered, and more. The range of available training modes is extensive and covers many kinds of sports, including running, cycling, swimming, hiking, and climbing. You can also connect the device to your wireless earbuds and control music playback and volume on many different music apps on your phone via the watch. Other noteworthy features include a compass, sleep and stress-level tracking, a flashlight setting, and a barometer. The watch was very comfortable to wear over long periods and I barely noticed it was on my arm until the occasional vibration informed me of a notification on my smartphone. The comfort level meant I rarely thought to take it off, and the impressive battery life didn’t require me to either. After more than 36 hours of moderate use without charging, the Watch GT 2’s battery was still at more than 75%. Huawei claims the 42mm delivers a week of typical use, while a single charge on the 46mm version will last up to two weeks. Charging the smartwatch then takes less than an hour, and the included magnetic charging puck can be connected to an adapter via a USB-C-to-USB-A cable. Below are the specifications of the Huawei Watch GT 2. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-329559 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_2--640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_2-.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_2--595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_2--300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-329563 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-329561 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_3-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_3-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_3-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-329555 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_5-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_5.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_5-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT-2-Sport_5-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
