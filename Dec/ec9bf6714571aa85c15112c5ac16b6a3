I like tech, especially hardware and gadgets that are at the top of their respective fields. Whether it is a smartwatch, a TV, or earphones – I want them all. Below are seven epic tech items available in South Africa which I would love to have. Available from the iStore, Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are popular among iPhone users. They offer a number of improvements over the standard AirPods – including the ability to switch active noise cancellation on or off with a single gesture. The AirPods Pro also offer up to 4.5 hours of listening time with a single charge, and more than 24 hours of listening time with their wireless charging case. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-325121" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AirPods-Pro-headline.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AirPods-Pro-headline.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AirPods-Pro-headline-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AirPods-Pro-headline-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Splurge on one of Samsung’s new 8K QLED TVs for your living room – you know you want to. At R66,999 for the 65-inch version, the 8K display is the most expensive item on the list. These 8K QLED TVs are the pinnacle of home entertainment, and they offer the best TV-viewing experience we have ever seen. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278331" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-8K-TV.jpg" alt="Samsung 8K TV" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-8K-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-8K-TV-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-8K-TV-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If you are willing to invest in a hobby which requires you to have a licence, the DJI Mavic 2 Pro is a dream come true. Not only does the Mavic 2 Pro fold up to fit in your hands, it also offers an incredibly robust design, up to 31 minutes of flight time, a 4K gimballed camera, and the ability to take HDR photos. It’s a bit expensive at R29,000, but if you’re looking for one of the coolest drones available, your search stops here. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331614" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DJI-Mavic-2-Pro.jpg" alt="DJI Mavic 2 Pro" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DJI-Mavic-2-Pro.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DJI-Mavic-2-Pro-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DJI-Mavic-2-Pro-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Reading is great, but why should you have to lug around a bunch of heavy books all the time? Instead, you can load countless volumes on a single, lightweight tablet with an E-Ink display and ensure there are no annoying message notifications to distract you while you read. The Kindle Paperwhite delivers all of this for R3,499. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303034" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kindle-Paperwhite.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kindle-Paperwhite.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kindle-Paperwhite-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Nintendo made a big comeback with its Switch console, which is both a mobile gaming station and a living-room console. It’s priced at around R5,999, although you will need to buy some games for it, too. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199254" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Nintendo-Switch-neon-docked.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Nintendo-Switch-neon-docked.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Nintendo-Switch-neon-docked-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Nintendo-Switch-neon-docked-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> When it comes to smartwatches, Huawei has the competition firmly beaten in terms of battery life. The company’s Watch GT 2 Sport boasts an incredible two weeks of battery life and includes all the features you’d expect from a smartwatch, such as a heart rate sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and more. The 46mm model of the Watch GT 2 even allows you to make calls through its built-in microphone and speaker, as well as save music directly to the device. It is priced at R4,999. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329387" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Watch-GT2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The gadgets above are great for almost anybody, but this last product is for the true tech enthusiasts.
