2019 was an exciting year in the South Africa IT and telecommunications market with many exciting developments and big changes. This year saw Rain launching the country’s first commercial 5G products and Telkom starting to roam on Vodacom’s network. Cell C, which continues to struggle financially, concluded a new agreement with MTN which gives it nationwide roaming. Another big development was MultiChoice’s listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) – the first new listing in 2019. 2019 was also a year where many South African companies and government institutions were targeted by cyber-criminals. A group which called itself “Shadow Kill Hackers” compromised the City of Johannesburg’s IT systems and demanded a ransom to not leak data which they said they stole. Local Internet service providers (ISPs) were also targeted by cybercriminals through DDoS attacks that saw many broadband users left without connectivity. To give an overview of these events and others which shaped the South African IT and telecoms market, here are the biggest stories of the year. Rain launched its new 5G service in September, offering “unlimited ultra-fast Internet” with speeds of up to 700Mbps. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-325773" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Rain-5G-unbox-header.jpg" alt="Rain 5G unbox header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Rain-5G-unbox-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Rain-5G-unbox-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Rain-5G-unbox-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In November, Telkom confirmed that it was in discussions with Cell C to acquire the embattled mobile network.
