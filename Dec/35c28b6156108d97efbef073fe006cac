Eskom announced that it is currently implementing stage 2 load-shedding until 23:00 on Wednesday 11 December. The power utility said that capacity remains limited, but it has made good process in the recovery of its electricity generation system, largely due to the recovery of power generation units following localised flooding at our power stations. “Breakdowns (UCLF) are at 13,302MW as of 04:36 this morning,” Eskom said. “We continue to use diesel for our open-cycle gas turbines and water at pumped storage schemes to supplement capacity.” “As the generating plant continues to perform at low levels of reliability, any unexpected shift such as an increase in unplanned breakdowns could result in a change in the load-shedding stage at short notice.” Eskom added that the probability of load-shedding remains high for the rest of the week and reminded customers that load-shedding is no cause for alarm, regardless of the stage. “Load-shedding is a responsible act and highly-controlled process, implemented to protect the country from a national blackout.” The power utility said it would keep South Africans informed of the status of the electricity system and its recovery effects.
