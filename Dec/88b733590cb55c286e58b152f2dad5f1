South African Airways (SAA) has suffered greatly due to the strike initiated by NUMSA and SACCA and requires a radical restructuring to move forward. This is according to a statement from Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, who said that SAA is unable to continue in its current form. “The strike initiated by NUMSA and SACCA caused immense damage to the reputation, operations, and the deterioration of the finances of SAA,” Gordhan said. “The airline group will now go through a radical restructuring process which will ensure its financial and operational sustainability. There is no other way forward.” Gordhan added that the South African government is committed to a viable, sustainable, and profitable national airline, and it is exploring various solutions to achieve this vision. “It is our collective responsibility as South Africans to support SAA in its efforts to restore sales confidence among its customer base and rebuild revenues in the shortest possible time,” he said. “We therefore reassure customers and encourage them to buy tickets with confidence.” Gordhan stated that SAA is determined to remain open for business, adding that the airline would intensify its marketing campaigns to rebuild confidence in the airline.
