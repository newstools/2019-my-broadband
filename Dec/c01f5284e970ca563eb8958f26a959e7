Worldwide shipments of smart wearables have increased by almost 95% compared to the same period last year. This is according to the latest report on wearable shipments for Q3 2019 from the International Data Corporation (IDC). The growth was largely thanks to the surge in demand for wireless earbuds such as Apple’s Airpods and other earbuds from manufacturers like Samsung and Huawei. These devices make up almost half of the market, followed by smart wristbands and smartwatches. Research director for IDC’s Wearables Team, Ramon T. Llamas, said that wireless earbuds have become the new “go-to product” in the wearables market. “This began with multiple vendors removing the headphone jack from their smartphones, driving the move toward wireless headphones. It continued with wireless earbuds incorporating additional features that either augment or expand the audio experience,” Llamas said. He also indicated that a drop in pricing helped push shipments of wireless headphones. The IDC report revealed that Apple continued to dominate the wearable market. The company increased its wearables market share from 23% in Q3 2018 to 35% in Q3 2019, totalling 29.5 million shipments in the last quarter. Xiaomi recorded the second-largest number of shipments, followed by Samsung, Huawei, and Fitbit.
