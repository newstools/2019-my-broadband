At a recent showcase, MultiChoice announced that DStv customers would soon be able to go “dishless”. This development means viewers will go online to subscribe to a DStv package and watch online – without needing a decoder, satellite dish or smartcard. For now, there are two ways DStv customers going away for the holidays can keep watching their favourite shows: on a decoder at their holiday home or streaming online with DStv Now. You also have the option to Reconnect your DStv decoder at your holiday home, but this means you’ll be paying two DStv subscriptions for the duration of your holiday. For more help, visit here. DStv Now is a streaming service available to all DStv subscribers – like Netflix or Showmax. It doesn’t cost anything extra, except for any data you might use. Register for DStv Now and keep watching your favourite channels on holiday, just like you do from your couch at home. Not everyone has Wi-Fi access at home or while on holiday. Find a Wi-Fi hotspot and open the DStv Now app on a smartphone or tablet. Go to the Catch Up section of the app and find your favourite series, sports highlights or a movie you’d like to watch. Hit the download button; they’ll stay on your device for 30 days. Get DStv Now » This article was published in partnership with MultiChoice.
