The MyBroadband November 2019 mobile app ratings revealed that MTN has the highest customer satisfaction rating of all mobile operators in South Africa. These ratings were gathered through the MyBroadband Speed Test App, which gives users the ability to test their network quality and rate their mobile operator. The rankings are based on thousands of individual customer satisfaction ratings from mobile users across South Africa. These ratings give a good overview of which operators have the happiest customers, and which operators should improve. MTN topped the list with an average score of 4.44, followed by Vodacom with 3.69, Telkom with 3.30, Rain with 3.26 and Cell C with 3.19. The most significant change in the rankings was Telkom climbing two spots from July 2019 and Rain dropping two places over the same period. Telkomâ€™s improvement is likely related to the operator solving its roaming problems, which frustrated many of its subscribers earlier this year. Rain, on the other hand, experienced significant network deterioration over the last few months which is reflected in its customer satisfaction ratings. The table below provides an overview of the customer satisfaction ratings in November 2019.
