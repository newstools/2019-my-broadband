Mozilla is set to launch a standalone VPN service for Windows 10 devices. Like other virtual private networks, the Firefox Private Network (FPN) encrypts a user’s data traffic and hides their location from websites and ad trackers. Mozilla previously announced a beta of FPN would be available as a Firefox browser extension to a limited number of testers in the United States. That beta has now been rolled out to more Firefox account holders,  allowing participants to sign up and receive 12 free hours of browsing with FPN protection. Mozilla is not the first company to offer a built-in VPN as part of its browser. Other browsers that currently support an integrated VPN solution include Opera and Tor. To use the standalone version, Firefox account holders must submit requests for invitations to the service. Successful applicants will receive access to the VPN at an introductory price of $4.99 per month. This version will let Windows 10 users select servers from more than 30 countries and allow the connection of up to five devices. Sign-ups are currently only available for users in the US. Mozilla further plans to bring FPN to more operating systems, including Android, iOS, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS.
