Microsoft will begin showing Windows 7 users a full-screen upgrade notification encouraging them to switch to Windows 10. “Starting on January 15, 2020, a full-screen notification will appear that describes the risk of continuing to use Windows 7 Service Pack 1 after it reaches end of support on January 14, 2020,” said Microsoft. Microsoft said that the notification will remain on users’ screens until they interact with it. Users will then be able to dismiss the notification, and when doing so, they will be given options to see the notification later or never see it again. Windows 7 operating systems which will display this notification include: Microsoft also explained that the notification will not appear on domain-joined machines or machines in kiosk mode. Microsoft is trying to encourage Windows 7 users to switch to the modern Windows 10 platform before the former loses official support. However, after months of decreased market share, Windows 7 appears to be stabilising, with around 26.86% of all desktop operating systems still using this old software. The official free upgrade period which allowed users to upgrade from Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 has expired, but it is still possible to do this by using a system clock exploit.
