Eskom has announced that it will lower the current stage 4 load-shedding to stage 2 from 23:00 on Friday. Stage 4 load-shedding was previously expected to continue until at least 06:00 on Saturday. However, Eskom confirmed that load-shedding will continue overnight and throughout Saturday to create capacity, “The system continues to be tight, with unplanned breakdowns of about 12,000MW necessitating the use of diesel and water reserves for open cycle gas turbines and pumped storage schemes respectively,” said Eskom in a statement. “With the incessant rain, we continue to experience coal-handling problems at a number of our power stations as a result of wet coal, which has led to generation units being unable to produce power.” Eskom reminded customers that stage 4 load-shedding is “no cause for alarm” as it means that the system is being effectively controlled. “Load-shedding is a highly controlled process, implemented to protect the system and to prevent a total collapse of the system or a national blackout.” “During Stage 4 load-shedding, approximately 80% of the country’s demand is still being met.” Eskom asked South Africans to reduce their electricity usage in a concerted effort, as this could help it to avoid or lessen the level of load-shedding it needs to implement.
