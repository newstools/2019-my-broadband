Long-range electric vehicle batteries are worse for the environment than diesel engines, according to Mazda. The company’s European research director, Christian Schultze, claimed that Mazda used a “responsibly” sized battery in its MX-30 electric car. He said the 35.5kWh battery produces a carbon footprint around the equivalent of a diesel version of the Mazda 3. This battery’s capacity is small when compared with the 100kWh units in Tesla’s higher-end Model X and Model S  cars. According to Mazda, the long-term effects of using a large pack would be worse for the environment than the effects of a diesel engine. The company said more emissions would be created from the manufacturing and disposal of the battery, in addition to the electricity generation required to charge the battery. Mazda’s claims have been met with scepticism from a number of motoring and energy experts. Several publications pointed out that the research does not take into consideration the uptake in renewable electricity reliance. The company used European electricity generation averages from 2016 to perform its calculations. Many countries now rely on more green energy production, which means their electricity needs are served through less CO2 emissions. Charging car batteries would therefore result in lower emissions. Its findings also contradicted previous research done by the International Council on Clean Transportation.
