Rain has had an eventful year, which included the launch of an online RICA system, the continued roll-out of its network, and the rapid growth of its customer base. The biggest moment of 2019 for Rain, however, was when it switched on its 5G network and began offering packages to the general public. Speaking to MyBroadband, Rain CEO Willem Roos said that the launch of Rain’s 5G offering was a big moment for the company. “The highlight for Rain in 2019 was undoubtedly the public launch of Africa’s first commercial 5G network,” Roos said. “Not only was it satisfying to see the strong interest shown by clients, but also the excellent network performance for new rain clients in the coverage area.” Shortly after the launch of its 5G network, Roos announced that Rain planned to grow its 5G network aggressively going forward. Roos said that Rain had 3,200 4G sites and 250 5G sites in October 2019. He said that by the end of 2020, Rain plans to have 5,000 4G sites and 700 5G sites in South Africa. “Our initial 5G network of 250 sites already ‘passes’ 500,000 households. That’s almost an equal size to the two largest fibre network operators in the country,” Roos said. This means that Rain’s 5G fixed-wireless solution may is already positioned as a great competitor to fibre Internet offerings, especially considering the speeds offered by the company’s 5G product. Rain has said that a good percentage of its customers were reaching speeds of 700Mbps, with the average speed being just above 200Mbps. MyBroadband tested out Rain’s 5G offering and found it to be truly impressive. Multiple speed tests on MyBroadband’s speed test platform gave an average download speed of 500Mbps, with speeds peaking at 700Mbps. Judging by these results, it is easy to see why Rain is proud of its 5G offering and excited about the product’s future prospects.
