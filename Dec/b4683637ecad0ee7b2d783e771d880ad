ASUS Republic of Gamers launched two new versions of the companyâ€™s high-performance Strix GL gaming desktops during an event in Johannesburg on 11 December. Attendees had the opportunity to try out the systems in games like Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, FIFA 20, Tekken, and F1. The tower PCs offer both ultimate gaming performance and premium RGB-rich builds. The flagship GL12CX uses the same black chassis as its predecessor, the GL12CM, but boasts overhauled specifications, with support for up to an eight-core i9-9900K processor and a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card. It also comes with liquid-cooling for select processors, customisable Aura-Sync lighting, and a hot-swap bay for an SSD for innovative storage flexibility. The GL12CX is liquid-cooled and factory-overclocked for optimal performance. The CPU is fully-unlocked for overclocking with Armoury Crate software. This software also allows for customisation of the Aura-Sync lighting technology, which can be synced with compatible peripherals and supported games to reflect in-game events and environments. The GL10CS balances power with affordability and can be configured with a six-core i7-8700 with up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM. It also supports up to a GTX 1060 graphics card with 6GB of VRAM, while users can choose either up to 512GB of NVMe SSD or 1TB HDD storage. This machine is ideal for 1080p gamers and content creators. The GL12CX will be priced from R29,999, while the GL10CS will start at R19,999. Both PCs will be available for purchase in late January 2020. Below are the maximum configurations of each gaming desktop and photos from the event. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-332648"
