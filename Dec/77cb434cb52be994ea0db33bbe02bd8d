Grand Theft Auto V remains one of the most popular games in South Africa despite the fact that it was launched in 2013. This is according to statistics from South African online retailer Raru, who said that both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game comfortably outsold any other title. “This is mostly due to the game being very well priced for long periods at a time,” said Raru. Takealot has also confirmed that Grand Theft Auto V is one of its most popular titles, claiming that only FIFA 20 is more popular on its platform. Takealot said that its best-selling console for 2019 was the PlayStation Classic, and added that gamers appear to be very interested in playing older games. “Retro gaming remains an incredibly popular pastime for many,” said Takealot. “We have seen that nostalgia and classic games continue to remain on-trend.” According to Raru, Nintendo Switch games perform remarkably well considering that they are usually exclusive to the Switch console. PlayStation remains a strong format, said Raru, while digital code sales for PSN, Xbox, and Steam remain extremely popular. Raru also highlighted that Pokémon Sword and Shield is already one of the top 10 most sold titles of the year despite the fact that its launch date was Friday 15 November.
