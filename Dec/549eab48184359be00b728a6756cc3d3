Building on the tremendous demand for AV over IP, NETGEAR has added new additions to the M4300 line of switches, 16, 24, and 48-port 10 Gigabit models. Additionally, two new 100 Gigabit network switches was added to its M4500 range. Distributed by Duxbury Networking, the new M4500 series 100 Gigabit Network Switches are purpose built to streamline audio-visual solutions over IP by reducing the complexity and cost of networked deployments but are equally applicable to standard IT network deployments. The M4500-32C and M4500-48XF8C combine the configurability of an AV matrix switcher with the power and scalability of Ethernet to support hundreds of AV over IP endpoints, at a price point that is dramatically lower than comparable matrix switchers. Removing the need for complicated Layer 3 PIM routing, these new switches offer NETGEAR-engineered IGMP Plus, which greatly simplifies system architectures with the same well-known L2 techniques across the entire AV over IP network. The M4500-32C 32-port 100Gbps switch can be leveraged to aggregate the edge switches for a complete setup for large projects of up to 320×320 SDVoE (10G) devices in a single architecture. The M4500-48XF8C switch is already preconfigured out-of-the-box, enabling true AV and multicast Zero Touch network configuration. So, installers simply need to connect AV endpoints, and power on the switch. <img class="size-large wp-image-331498 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Netgear-switches-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Netgear-switches.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Netgear-switches-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Netgear-switches-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “NETGEAR is driving the technology transition for the audiovisual space by offering more managed switches that can ease the move from the traditional complexities and expense of disseminating video and audio to big screens,” said Tobie van Schalkwyk, product manager for NETGEAR at Duxbury Networking, distributor of NETGEAR switch solutions. “We can now offer customers a range of port options to meet the needs of smaller deployments such as in home or small business and the 100G option will address the growing demands of providing the highest quality video to the stadium level displays.” The M4300-16X is the world’s first 16-port 100M/1G/2.5G/5G/10GBASE-T copper switch with an option for PoE+ across all ports in full provisioning mode. The M4300-16X is a half-width 1U switch that comes either with a non-PoE power supply or with a power supply capable of providing 500W of PoE power to the 16 ports. The M4300-24XF is a 24-port 10GBASE-X SFP+ fibre switch with two shared 10GBASE-T copper ports. The M4300-24XF is a half-width 1U switch that dramatically lowers the cost of fibre-based project installations up to 24 nodes. NETGEAR is also introducing the M4300-48XF, a 48-port 10GBASE-X SFP+ fibre switch with two shared 10GBASE-T copper ports. The M4300-48XF is a full-width 1U switch for fibre-based project installations up to 48 nodes. “All M4300 models are certified for Software Defined Video over Ethernet (SDVoE) devices for the ultimate in AV over IP deployments. They are also ideal in any IT deployment that need fast, reliable and cost-effective networking,” said Van Schalkwyk.
