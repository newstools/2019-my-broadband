Apple will open orders for its new Mac Pro 2019 computer on 10 December. YouTuber Marques Brownlee spotted that Apple has begun sending notifications regarding the computer’s release date to various people it perceives as potential customers. “Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR. The wait is almost over. Available to order December 10,” the notification stated. Apple’s latest desktop computer has a massive price tag and powerful specifications, and it is not targeted at mainstream consumers. Instead, it is aimed at professionals in the creative sector – such as movie editors – who need very powerful hardware to achieve their goals. The Mac Pro 2019 can be configured with up to a 28-core Intel Xeon processor and 1.5TB of system memory. It has eight internal PCI slots, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and two USB Type-A ports. The Mac Pro can also be fitted with up to two Vega II Duo graphics modules, each of which features AMD Radeon Vega II GPUs, meaning that with a fully-kitted system, users can access up to 128GB of HBM2 video memory. The desktop can also be fitted with an Afterburner video editing module, which can process six billion pixels per second, allowing users to process three 8K streams simultaneously. The base model of the new Mac Pro 2019 will have an eight-core Intel Xeon processor, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an AMD Radeon Pro 580X graphics card. Apple’s new Mac Pro 2019 is priced from $5,999 – or R84,999 in South Africa – but the Pro Display XDR monitor and stand will cost another $4,999 and $999 respectively.
