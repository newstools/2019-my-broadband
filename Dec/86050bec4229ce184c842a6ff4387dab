Cell C announced its partnership with the Explore Data Science education initiative for a year-long data science course at an event in Johannesburg today. Explore Data Science is an educational institution run by actuaries and engineers which offers a variety of courses in the field of data science. “South Africa has a couple of changes we’re trying to fix. One of those is youth unemployment,” said Mark Schroeder, COO of Explore Data Science. “We believe we can get people ready for the workforce 10 times cheaper than the current education platforms. We teach problem-solving skills, learning how to learn, and curiosity; underlying that we have technical skills teaching that is of course also very important.” Cell C Chief Human Capital Officer Juliette Mhango said that the Explore Data Science programme aligns with Cell C’s business and transformation objectives. “We are finding that the youth are not equipped with the skills to get into business, so we’re trying to equip the youth with these skills which they can use both now and into the future.” 10 Cell C employees will also take part in the course so that they can develop their data science skills. Explore Data Science accepts students based on their aptitude rather than their matric or university marks. To be accepted, students must undergo a rigorous process that includes an aptitude test, a coding boot camp – to test that the learner can learn digital skills quickly and efficiently – and an in-person interview. “The journey is not easy. There are challenges that you will face during your time at Explore,” one former student told the group who will be taking this course.
