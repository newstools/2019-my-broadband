Telkom has unveiled its Big Deal for December 2019. The deal offers customers two contracts which include a MiFi and a WiFi router, and a total 60GB of data, for R399 per month. “Keep the December vibes jolly with an enormous 60GB of data for your home and when you’re out and about,” said Telkom. The deal includes the following: The 20GB data package is accessible on the Wi-Fi router, while the 10GB data package is meant to be used with the Mi-Fi router. This deal will run until the end of December 2019 and is only available on a 24-month contract. Telkom recently made a bid to acquire Cell C, which would have won it a business boasting approximately 22 million mobile subscribers. However, this bid was rejected by Cell C on Friday 29 November. “Telkom has received written notice from the Cell C board of directors rejecting its non-binding proposal,” Telkom said in a statement to shareholders. “The Telkom Board continues to believe the Offer is a compelling proposition that would have created significant value for all stakeholders including Telkom’s shareholders.”
