2019 was a big year in the South African IT and telecommunications market, with new policies and corporate action headlining the news. The telecommunications sector dominated headlines with stories related to Cell C’s financial woes, Telkom looking to buy Cell C and Remgro’s big telecoms plans. MultiChoice’s JSE listing and Webafrica looking for someone to buy the company also made headlines. Another topic which was of particular interest to consumers was the continued Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on local ISPs. These attacks took many ISPs offline which left many consumers and businesses without connectivity. The past year has also seen many big moves from South African IT and telecommunications executives. These included the resignation of two top Vodacom C-level executives and a few high-profile tech CEOs stepping down. Here are the biggest executive moves in 2019. Community Investment Ventures Holdings (CIVH) has announced that Raymond Ndlovu is its new CEO and will lead the company’s newly-announced executive team. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329959" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Raymond-Ndlovu.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Raymond-Ndlovu.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Raymond-Ndlovu-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Teraco CEO Lex van Wyk is stepping down at the end of 2019. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-88067" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lex-van-Wyk.jpg" alt="Lex van Wyk" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lex-van-Wyk.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lex-van-Wyk-250x166.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Vodacom CFO Till Streichert  resigned only days after the company announced that its CTO Andries Delport would be leaving. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-330183" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Till-Streichert.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Till-Streichert.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Till-Streichert-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Vodacom CTO Andries Delport resigned from Vodacom and is set to join CIVH as Chief Technology Officer to help oversee Remgro’s telecommunication assets. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258737" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Andries-Delport.jpg" alt="Andries Delport" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Andries-Delport.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Andries-Delport-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Reunert executive director and Nashua CEO Mark Taylor resigned in preparation of leaving the country. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315373" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mark-Taylor.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mark-Taylor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mark-Taylor-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mark-Taylor-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cell C appointed Douglas Craigie Stevenson as chief executive officer (CEO) in August. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315773" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Douglas-Craigie-Stevenson.jpg" alt="Douglas Craigie Stevenson" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Douglas-Craigie-Stevenson.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Douglas-Craigie-Stevenson-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Douglas-Craigie-Stevenson-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> SA Post Office CEO Mark Barnes resigned in August, citing differences on a forward strategy in relation to the structure of the group, in particular the location of Postbank. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-232195" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Mark-Barnes.jpg" alt="Mark Barnes" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Mark-Barnes.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Mark-Barnes-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The .ZA Domain Name Authority (ZADNA) announced that Vika Mpisane has been terminated as the organisation’s CEO.
