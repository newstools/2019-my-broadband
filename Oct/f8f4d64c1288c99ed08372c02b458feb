DStv is set to cut three popular channels from its network at the end of October – History, Crime + Investigation, and Lifetime. The contract term for these channels, which are all produced by the American broadcasting company A&E Television Networks, ends on 1 November 2019. MultiChoice said the decision to cut these channels forms part of its “ongoing efforts to refresh our content line-up and optimise the suite of channels on offer”. “We are continuously reviewing our content line-up and channel selection to improve our entertainment offering to our customers,” MultiChoice said. “This process includes ongoing engagement with various content partners to ensure we can provide more compelling content offerings for customers.” MultiChoice said it will soon announce the introduction of two new channels to DStv – an established global brand and a new innovative brand. “Both channels will bring exciting new titles and genres that viewers will really enjoy, including among others blue chip documentaries, history and factual reality shows,” MultiChoice said. The company added that it continues to increase its investment in local shows and content, which it said have great resonance with customers and are a key driver of engagement.
