Google recently launched its Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones at its Made By Google event. The new Pixel devices offer improved camera systems as well as 90Hz displays. They also boast impressive voice recording software that can transcribe speech as it records. This followed after Apple launched its iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max smartphones last month, which also boast an improved camera system. The new iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are more rugged than before, boasting an IP68 rating and what Apple claims to be the toughest glass ever implemented on a smartphone. We compared these two premium smartphone ranges to get an idea of how their features and specifications match up. Both the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL use the latest version of Google’s own operating system – Android 10. The iPhone 11 range uses Apple’s latest operating system – iOS 13. The Pixel 4 and 4 XL both boast Motion Sense capabilities, which allow you to control your device with simple gestures. By using an integrated Soli radar chip, the Pixel 4 can read your gestures in front of the smartphone without you directly touching it. Google stated that the Motion Sense gesture processing happens offline on your device and can easily be turned off. Both smartphone ranges offer IP68 build quality, which means that they are both dust- and water-resistant. They all also offer FaceID biometric security technology, and neither range offers a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel 4 and 4 XL have 5.7-inch and 6.2-inch OLED displays respectively, each of which offers a 90Hz refresh rate. Both Pixel smartphones pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage. The Pixel 4 sports a 2,800mAh battery while the Pixel 4 XL has a larger 3,700mAh battery. In contrast, the iPhone 11 Pro has a 5.8-inch OLED display, while the Pro Max sports a 6.5-inch OLED screen. While Apple does not disclose its RAM or battery numbers, it is believed that the smartphones have 6GB of RAM. It is known for certain that both iPhone 11 Pro smartphones include Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip as well as up to 512GB storage space. The Pixel 4 and 4 XL use an identical dual-lens camera system. This includes a 16MP telephoto lens and a 12.2MP wide lens, and is capable of recording 4K video at 30fps, or 1080p video at up to 120fps. The front camera of the Pixel uses an 8MP wide lens, and also includes a TOF 3D camera. It can record video using Auto-HDR technology up to 1080p at 30fps. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max both offer triple-lens systems comprising a 12MP wide lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens. They are placed in a square module in the corner of the phone and are capable of 2x optical zoom. The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are capable of shooting 4K video in 60fps, and offer a variety of impressive features such as time-lapse and slow-motion. The camera system also allows users to film with two cameras – allowing the user to use both the front and rear camera systems simultaneously. The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro launched in South Africa on 27 September with the 64GB versions priced at R14,999 and R21,999 respectively. It is not yet clear whether the Pixel 4 range will come to South Africa.
