Microsoft has launched new keyboards which contain two new keys. The new keys are: These dedicated keys allows users to access Microsoft Office or the Windows 10 emoji picker with a single press. The keys are available in a new Bluetooth Keyboard and a new Ergonomic Keyboard â€“ priced at $49.99 and $59.99 respectively. The Verge stated that the keyboards were launched at a Microsoft Surface event held last week, but the company did not place much focus on them. It added that the Office key will replace the right-hand Windows key, and can also be used with various letters to directly open apps in Office. For example, Office key + W opens Word and Office key + X open Excel, instead of the Office suite. The emoji key will open the emoji picker in Windows 10, and cannot be linked to a specific emoji. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-323092" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keys.jpg" alt="Keys" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keys.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keys-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keys-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323088 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keyboard-640x321.jpg" alt="Keyboard" width="640" height="321" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keyboard-640x321.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keyboard-600x301.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keyboard-768x385.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keyboard-1200x602.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keyboard.jpg 1594w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
