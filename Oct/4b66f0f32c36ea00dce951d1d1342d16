With most economically-active people in South Africa using smartphones, it is now necessary for many businesses to have their own mobile apps to remain competitive. Android and iOS smartphone apps make it possible for a business to occupy a space on their clients’ home screens and improve loyalty among their customers. The value of mobile apps, however, goes far beyond improved client interaction and creating a direct marketing channel visible to clients at all times.
