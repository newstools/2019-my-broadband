US President Donald Trump has joined Amazon’s Twitch game streaming platform. The decision to create an official channel on the platform is peculiar given that Trump blamed video games for mass shootings in Texas and Ohio in August. The service is also owned by Amazon, a company with whose leadership the president has bumped heads on various occasions. At the time of writing, Trump’s official Twitch account has more than 33,000 followers. It is very unlikely that the president will be streaming any Fortnite games, though. The channel has one video thus far – a livestream of an election rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota yesterday.  The video garnered a total of just over 10,000 views. Trump is the third 2020 presidential candidate to sign up for the service. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders also joined Twitch in July of this year and has posted more than 60 campaign videos on the channel, which draws 88,000 followers. He has also set up a way for people to donate to his presidential campaign. Twitch has more than 15 million daily active users, with Americans comprising about 21.32% of viewers.
