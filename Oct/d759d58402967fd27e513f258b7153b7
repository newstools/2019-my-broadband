MyBroadband Insights has released its Q3 2019 Mobile Network Quality Report, which shows that MTN has the best mobile network in South Africa. The report is based on 314,751 speed tests which were performed by thousands of MyBroadband Android Speed Test App users across South Africa between 1 July and 30 September 2019. The research shows that South Africa had an average mobile download speed of 24.68Mbps and an average upload speed of 9.03Mbps. MTN had the highest average download speed at 35.31Mbps, followed by Vodacom on 31.19Mbps, Telkom on 22.42Mbps, Rain on 16.71Mbps, and Cell C on 17.18Mbps. To determine the best mobile network in South Africa, a “Network Quality Score” was calculated for each network using download speed, upload speed, and latency. The Network Quality Score out of 10 then shows how the network performed in relation to other networks. MTN reigned supreme with a Network Quality Score of 10.00, followed by Vodacom on 8.72, Telkom on 6.23, Rain on 5.88, and Cell C on 5.58.
