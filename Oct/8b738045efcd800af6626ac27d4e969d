Motorola officially revealed its new budget-friendly Motorola One Macro smartphone today, following numerous leaks of the device in the last few weeks. The Macro is the fifth smartphone in Motorola’s One line-up, following the One Zoom, One Action, One Vision, and original One. Just like the other smartphones in the range, the Macro’s name is derived from the phone’s standout feature, the rear camera’s 2MP macro lens, which allows for super close-up photography. The rear camera system also features a 13MP main sensor and 2MP depth sensor, while the front camera has an 8MP lens. Other specifications include an octa-core Mediatek Helio P70 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB built-in storage, and a 4,000mAh battery. The Macro One has so far only been launched in India at a price of Rs9,999 (R2,135) and is expected to come to the US, Latin American, and European markets on 24 October 2019. Local availability and pricing are yet to be confirmed. Below are the specifications for the Motorola One Macro. <img class="size-medium wp-image-322724 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-One-Macro-spec-595x400.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-One-Macro-spec-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-One-Macro-spec-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-One-Macro-spec.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 85vw, 595px" />
