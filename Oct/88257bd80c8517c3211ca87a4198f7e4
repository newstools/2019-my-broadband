Microsoft revealed its own smart wireless earphones, the Surface Earbuds, on Wednesday. The Earbuds are the company’s first attempt at an in-ear version of wireless headphones, after introducing the Microsoft Surface Headphones late last year. Microsoft said the unique design of the Earbuds is “ultra-comfortable” and features four anchor points for a secure fit. The Earbuds boast omnisonic sound and can be controlled by voice and touch, and each bud contains dual microphones for optimal call quality and voice recognition. They also sport native Spotify support on Android, allowing the user to instantly play music and control their playlist by tapping and using gestures close to the Earbuds. The Earbuds also offer unique integration with the Office365 suite, which includes seamless voice access to Outlook’s calendar and emails. During a presentation, Microsoft will be able to translate your speech into one of more than 60 languages and display it in captions on a screen. Microsoft claims the batteries for the Earbuds will last up to 24 hours. A wireless charging case will be included with the Earbuds. The Surface Earbuds will cost $249. An official release date has not been announced. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-322040" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Earbuds-640x359.jpg" alt="Surface Earbuds" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Earbuds-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Earbuds-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Earbuds-768x431.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Earbuds.jpg 1042w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-322042" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-earbuds-2-640x381.jpg" alt="Surface earbuds 2" width="640" height="381" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-earbuds-2-640x381.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-earbuds-2-600x357.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-earbuds-2-768x457.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-earbuds-2.jpg 908w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
