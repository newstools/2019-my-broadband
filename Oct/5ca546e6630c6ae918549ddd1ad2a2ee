More details have been leaked by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo regarding the rumoured iPhone SE 2 smartphone. According to Kuo, the iPhone SE 2 will be priced from $399, making it an attractive option for users who want an Apple smartphone without paying a fortune. It will use the same body as the iPhone 8, meaning that it will feature a 4.7-inch LCD display without a notch, as well as a Home button. Apple’s iPhone SE 2 will also offer Touch ID biometric security, said Kuo, although Face ID is unlikely to be available. It is only expected to have a single-lens camera – just like the iPhone 8 – but will follow the modern iPhone range’s lead by replacing 3D Touch with a software-based system. The iPhone SE 2 will run Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip and will include 3GB of RAM, Kuo said. “Though most of iPhone SE2′s hardware spec will be similar to iPhone 8′s, we think the excellent computing power offered by A13 and 3GB LPDDR4X, and the more affordable price will be great selling points,” Kuo said. Kuo also expects that the iPhone SE 2 will ship in 64GB and 128GB versions as well as in three colours – silver, space grey, and red. The analyst speculates that the iPhone SE 2 will be highly successful due to its low price point. “We estimate iPhone SE2 shipments in 2020 will reach 30–40 [million] units,” said Kuo.
