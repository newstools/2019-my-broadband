Google will reportedly replace Google Home and Google Home Mini devices that have stopped working as the result of a recent firmware update. This is after several users reported that their devices had been acting up over the course of the year. In some cases, the devices had become completely unresponsive, with all four LEDs lighting up. While a reboot or factory reset fixed the issue on a couple of the devices, many were still unusable. Following a flurry of reports since September, Google investigated and confirmed the cause of the problem was a faulty automatic firmware update. In a statement sent to 9to5Google yesterday, the company said that it would introduce an update for the issue soon. It will also provide replacements of all bricked devices, including those that are no longer under warranty. “We are aware that a small number of Google Home and Google Home Mini devices are affected by an issue that causes the device to stop working. We have a fix that will prevent the issue from happening and will be rolling it out soon. We are replacing affected devices,” Google said.
