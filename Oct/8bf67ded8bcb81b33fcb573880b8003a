FNB Connect has launched two new voice-focused mobile plans which offer unlimited calls to any local network, 24 hours per day. “Voice calls are still very important to our customers and South African consumers at large, despite the rising demand for data services. Contrary to popular belief, our analysis shows that higher income groups still use voice services more than the average consumer,” said FNB Connect CEO Len Pienaar. “We want to give all our customers the opportunity to talk again. We want to allow our customers to be able to call friends and family and talk, and not worry about that airtime balance ticking down,” he said. FNB Connect’s new voice offerings are significantly cheaper than its previous voice-focused offerings, which offered customers 4,000 minutes for R399 per month. The new Talk Max and Talk Max Pro mobile plans offer unlimited minutes and are available on a month-to-month basis. Both of these mobile plans offer unlimited voice minutes, but there is a fair usage policy (FUP) which is detailed below: “The fair usage requirements ensure that customers use the packages for their everyday cell phone needs and not misused for commercial or other purposes. This will ensure that the offering remains viable for us whilst fulfilling the needs of our customers,” Pienaar said. “We remain committed to providing customers with added value and convenience that ensures customer satisfaction and lessens customer’s angst around their telco spend.” Below are the pricing and details for FNB Connect’s new Talk Max and Talk Max Pro mobile plans:
