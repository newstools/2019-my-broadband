Microsoft has announced that its OneDrive Personal Vault is now available to consumers in countries around the world, including South Africa. OneDrive is Microsoft’s cloud storage solution which allows users to sync documents and Windows settings across a range of devices. The new Personal Vault feature uses two-factor authentication (2FA) protection to secure files, adding a second identity verification method to provide a more secure location for storing sensitive documents. Gaining access to this protected area of your OneDrive storage will require the use of a linked mobile authenticator app, PIN, fingerprint scan, facial recognition, or a code sent via SMS or email. Every time a user wants to open their Personal Vault, they will have to confirm their identity. In addition to this second layer of authentication, Personal Vault also includes a host of other security features. The “Scan and shoot” feature, for example, lets OneDrive app users scan documents or take photos which save directly into their Personal Vault, without ever having to save them locally in a photo gallery or camera roll. The Personal Vault will also close and lock after a period of inactivity, and Windows 10 PC users will have the added benefit of Personal Vault files being synced to a Bitlocker-encrypted space on their hard drive.
