Disney has revealed “basically everything” coming to its new streaming service when it launches in the United States next month. The company published a comprehensive list of shows on Twitter, as well as a three-hour-long video on YouTube detailing the lineup. Disney+ will offer a great selection of series and movies from as far back as the 1940s and 1950s – including Treasure Island, The Sign of Zorro, and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea – to the entire Star Wars film lineup until Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The streaming service will also host its own share of originals, which includes Star Wars live-action series The Mandalorian, and a remake of The Lady and the Tramp. Exclusive content is available from Disney films, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, and National Geographic, among others. There is no information on whether Disney+ will launch in South Africa following its US launch. Additionally, if Disney+ were to launch in South Africa, it is uncertain whether its lineup of shows will be as extensive as it is in the US due to local licensing. Disney+ will launch on 12 November in the United States and will be priced at $6.99 per month. Below are some of the best shows which will be available at launch below, along with Disney’s three-hour video detailing all the new content: <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323382" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl-640x333.jpg" alt="pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl" width="640" height="333" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl-640x333.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl-600x313.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl-768x400.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl-1200x625.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-140196" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Simpsons-600x400.jpg" alt="The Simpsons" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Simpsons.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Simpsons-250x166.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323380" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wall-e-640x333.jpg" alt="wall-e" width="640" height="333" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wall-e-640x333.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wall-e-600x313.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wall-e-768x400.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wall-e-1200x625.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wall-e.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323384" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the_mandalorian_-_h_-_2019-640x361.jpg" alt="Mandalorian" width="640" height="361" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the_mandalorian_-_h_-_2019-640x361.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the_mandalorian_-_h_-_2019-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the_mandalorian_-_h_-_2019.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-274691" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Iron-Man-3-header.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Iron-Man-3-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Iron-Man-3-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Iron-Man-3-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-314585" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Before-the-Flood-640x356.jpg" alt="Before the Flood" width="640" height="356" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Before-the-Flood-640x356.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Before-the-Flood-600x333.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Before-the-Flood-768x427.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Before-the-Flood-1200x667.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Before-the-Flood.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
