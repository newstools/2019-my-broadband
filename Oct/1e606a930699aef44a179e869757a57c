More people are buying entry-level and mid-price phones, global smartphone sale trends have shown. Brands like Honor and Xiaomi offer very capable options in the lower tier, priced under R3,000. If, however, you require a slightly more powerful device that does not break the bank, the mid-range has many options. A good example of this is how Samsung is increasingly competing against Huawei at the mid-range level with its Galaxy A Series. To see what some of the best mid-range options cost, we compared several offerings in this category. Prices are taken from Takealot. For a smartphone at this price-point, the A70 boasts some impressive flagship-like features, like a rear triple-camera system (32MP+8MP+5MP), a 6.7-inch bezel-less AMOLED 2,400 x 1,080 display and a massive 4,500mAh battery. It also comes with built-in storage of 128GB and supports the use of dual SIMs. In balancing affordability and capability, Expert Reviews states that the A70 has “the right ingredients”. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-304080" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A70.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A70" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A70.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A70-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A70-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
