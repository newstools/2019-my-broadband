It can be difficult to find a laptop which delivers good performance while still being small and light enough to carry around on a daily basis. The ASUS ZenBook series – specifically the ZenBook S13 – addresses this demand by offering a high-end CPU, discrete graphics, and an ultra-portable design. All the features of a conventional professional laptop are included in the device, such as a fingerprint sensor, webcam, and sleek aluminium finish. In addition to this array of features, it still manages to pack some serious hardware into a chassis that also houses a high-resolution display with barely any side bezels. The ZenBook S13 is an impressive piece of hardware, and we were very excited when ASUS provided us with a unit to try out for ourselves. When opening up the ZenBook S13, you will immediately notice the ultra-thin bezels and high screen-to-body ratio. This is attained by combining the device’s NanoEdge display technology with a small lip at the top of the display which houses the webcam and other hardware. ASUS states that this unique design gives the ZenBook S13 the world’s slimmest bezels and a 97% screen-to-body ratio. The ZenBook S13 has not compromised any performance to deliver its small form factor and lightweight design, as it packs both an Intel Core i7 processor in addition to a discrete Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card. These chips are paired with PCIe NVMe storage as well as 16GB of RAM to deliver ultra-fast performance across a wide variety of applications. The full specifications of the ASUS ZenBook S13 provided to us for review are listed below. With it’s slim and lightweight aluminium unibody frame and ultra-thin profile, the ZenBook S13 makes a great companion for professional users. The device weighs only 1.1kg and takes up much less space than conventional laptops while being fast enough to handle even the most demanding tasks. This is not necessarily the most important thing for daily laptop users, however, as battery life can also be a major consideration. The ASUS ZenBook 13 not only boasts a 50Wh cell with up to 15 hours of battery life, but it also includes fast charging technology that can charge your device up to 60% capacity in 49 minutes. This, paired with its military-grade quality testing, makes the ZenBook S13 one of the most reliable laptops on the market. When we tested the device, we were immediately impressed by its form factor and display design. Thanks to its bezel-less display, the device seems more than big enough to use as a desktop replacement when open, and small enough to fit in any carrier bag when closed. Battery life was particularly impressive, as was the build quality of the extremely thin chassis, which impressed us with its durability and lack of flex. Harmon Kardon speakers were certainly a welcome touch, and the great sound quality rounded out a product that delivers every modern notebook feature in a smaller and lighter form factor. The ZenBook S13 is a great all-rounder, capable of handling professional tasks while being light and reliable. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321940" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-5.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook S13 5" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-5.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-5-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-5-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321938" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-4.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook S13 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321934" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-2.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook S13 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321932" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-1.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook S13 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
