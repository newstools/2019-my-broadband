Now is the time to leverage the power of the Guzzle to look ahead to the festive shopping season trends and special retail calendar dates. Guzzle offers insights into the current state of festive shopping. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-322622" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Festive-shopping.png" alt="" width="500" height="333" /> Black Friday is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States and is marked by the start of Christmas holiday shopping. The name Black Friday was a phrase coined by the police to describe the mayhem surrounding the congestion of shoppers and automotive traffic which resulted in traffic accidents and sometimes violence. When Black Friday initially became a flagship retail event in South Africa, retailers kept bargain deals a secret until the actual Friday and would normally launch at midnight. Our  research has indicated that around 56% of festive shopping happens before Black Friday, starting after the pay day in September. Shoppers are expected to start buying early in order to save their December salaries for the Christmas or new year holiday period. This may be the biggest Black Friday week yet, landing after pay day and a few days closer to Christmas. Last year most retailers released deals information a couple of days before (Tuesday and Wednesday), allowing shoppers to do their research and prepare for the big day. Guzzle served a total of 6.8 million page views to more than 400,000 users during Black Friday week (only) in 2018. A 30% increase is expected for this year. Back to school shopping can be expensive for parents and guardians as they buy backpacks, outfits, stationery and so much more. Parents and guardians are better advised to explore the school supplies market to ensure they save a little on discounted prices in certain retail stores. Guzzle insights show that back to school shopping will also start early (early to mid-December), as the new school year will kick off early in January 2020. Stationery shopping will run into February though, due to some parents waiting for the January salary.
