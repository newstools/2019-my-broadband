South African iPhone users who have downloaded the latest update for Apple’s iOS operating system – iOS 13 – are reporting serious issues when placing or receiving cellular calls. The problem is exclusive to customers who are running any version of iOS 13 and is particularly prevalent on Vodacom’s mobile network. MyBroadband has received reports from multiple affected users, with all of them stating that within the first 10 seconds of placing or receiving a call, they are suddenly cut off and the call is ended. A number of users on social media have complained about the same problem, with all of them adding that they are running iOS 13. Vodacom confirmed that it was aware of this issue in response to individual complaints on Twitter. In its responses to complaining customers, Vodacom said that a “new feature” added in iOS 13 was responsible for the issue. “iOS 13 has added a new feature that Apple users should disable,” Vodacom said. The company said that to fix the problem of dropped calls on its network, its customers should disable Voice over LTE (VoLTE) in their device’s settings menu. “Go to Settings > Mobile Data > Mobile Data Options > Voice & Data and turn off 4G, VoLTE,” Vodacom instructed customers. The network confirmed that the problem was related to the VoLTE setting in another tweet. We are aware of an issue with iOS 13 – please make sure your VoLTE is disabled, this should end your dropped call saga, Vodacom said. IOS 13 added a new feature which apple users should disable. Go to settings>mobile data>mobile data options>Voice & Data and turn off 4G, VoLTE — Vodacom (@Vodacom) October 20, 2019  It is unclear what change in iOS 13 caused this problem on Vodacom’s network in South Africa. The company has also not elaborated on how the VoLTE option in iOS 13 interferes with cellular calls on its network. MyBroadband asked Vodacom for additional feedback, but the company did not comment by the time of publication.
