Huawei has announced that its Mate X foldable phone will go on sale from 15 November. The phone’s launch has been repeatedly delayed, partly due to the ongoing US-China trade war and its effect on the manufacturer’s ability to use Google Mobile Services. As a result of the trade embargo, the Mate X will not have support for Google apps and services, just like the recently unveiled Mate 30 devices. The device will take on Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which was finally released in September after Samsung revised several components that were causing it to malfunction. Motorola is also expected to launch its foldable Razr smartphone on 13 November. The Mate X features an octa-core Kirin 980 processor and 5G connectivity, and its dual-cell 4,500mAh battery can reportedly reach an 85% charge in 30 minutes. As opposed to the book-like folding of the Samsung Galaxy Fold, the Mate X folds outwards, with the display wrapping around the edge of the device when closed. In its unfolded state, the display measures eight inches, while the folded position provides 6.6 inches of front screen space and 6.38 inches on the back. The initial Mate X release is limited to China, with the 512GB version priced at 16,999 yuan (R35,250). Huawei told the Verge that it will asses the possibility of a worldwide release in due course. “Our strategy is based on carriers’ 5G roll out in different regions. So far, Huawei has made the Huawei Mate X available in the China market on November 15. A global launch plan is under review,” Huawei said.
