Motorola wants to launch a flagship smartphone that will compete with the top Samsung, Apple, and Huawei devices, TechRadar reports. Speaking at a media briefing, Motorola announced three new smartphones, and used a graph to show how its various smartphone products compare to each other. This graph also mentioned an unnamed “flagship” device which was positioned above all of its new smartphones. Motorola did not provide any specifications for this flagship device, nor did they provide any hints as to when such a device could be announced. However, it is likely that the new version of the company’s iconic foldable Razr cellphone, which is expected to be announced on 13 November, will be the premium smartphone that Motorola has mentioned. When Motorola released its Z-series in 2016, it was a flagship device, and competed in the same bracket as the Galaxy S7. Likewise, in 2017, the Z2 Force was on similar footing to the Galaxy S8 in terms of its specifications. However, 2018 saw the company re-position the Z-series as mid-range devices, with the third-generation Z-series smartphone sporting an older processor and an inferior display to 2018’s premium devices. Likewise, this year’s Z4 uses a Snapdragon 675 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and a single-lens rear camera system – firmly embedding it in the mid-range market.
