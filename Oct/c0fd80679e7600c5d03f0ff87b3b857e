Microsoft has unveiled its new dual-screen Surface device, which it has named the Surface Neo. The device comprises two 9-inch screens separated by a hinge in the middle, allowing the Surface Neo to open up and offer a full-size 13-inch display. This hinge provides 360 degrees of movement, allowing you to position the Surface Neo in whatever posture suits your needs. Microsoft said the dual-screen device will run the Windows 10 X operating system, which is designed specifically for dual-screen computing devices. The Surface Neo is also compatible with Surface Pen and includes a detachable Bluetooth keyboard which snaps magnetically on and off the screenâ€™s surface. This means that users will be able to use the Surface Neo as a standard laptop with a physical keyboard, as well as detach the keyboard and use the device as a desktop replacement with the added productivity of two screens. The specifications of the dual-screen device remain unknown, but Microsoft said that it is built for productivity and multitasking. Microsoft did not reveal any pricing or release date information for the Surface Neo, although the device is expected to release some time in 2020. Photos of the dual-screen Surface Neo are posted below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-321966" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-1-640x411.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="411" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-1-640x411.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-1-600x385.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-1-768x493.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-321972" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-4-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-4-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-4-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-4.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-321974" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-5-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-5-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-5-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-5.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-321976" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-6-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-6-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-6-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-6-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SurfaceNeo-6.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321980" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Neo-fixed-1.jpg" alt="Surface Neo fixed 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Neo-fixed-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Neo-fixed-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Neo-fixed-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321982" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Neo-fixed-2.jpg" alt="Surface Neo fixed 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Neo-fixed-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Neo-fixed-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Surface-Neo-fixed-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
