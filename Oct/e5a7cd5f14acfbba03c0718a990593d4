Version 78 of the Google Chrome browser is now available for download. The updated version is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and iOS. Google has added its Chrome Password Safety tool to Chrome, which allows users to check if their passwords have been leaked. The feature was previously available as a Google-made Chrome extension, but the company has now implemented it directly into its browser. However, the new version of the feature only works if users have synced their passwords stored on Chrome to their Google account. Another notable new feature in Chrome 78 is a customisation menu, which allows users to implement new themes, change the appearance of their New Tab page shortcuts, and customise their New Tab wallpaper. To enable this feature, users must access the chrome://flags section of their browser, and enable two things – NTP Customisation Menu Version 2, and Chrome Colours Menu. Chrome 78 will also allow users to hover over a tab to see more information about the webpage it contains. This feature is called Tab Hover Cards, and is designed to help power users who use lots of tabs at one time. Finally, Chrome will allow users to force dark mode across all websites – even on websites that don’t support a dark theme. Google doesn’t edit the website’s code to achieve this; rather, it uses “colour theory inversion” to turn light websites into dark versions.
