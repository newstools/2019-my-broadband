Spotify has announced that it is giving Premium subscribers a free Google Home Mini smart speaker valued at $50. The digital music service will offer the promotion from now until 15 November, or while stocks last. The deal does not give subscribers Google’s recently unveiled Nest Mini, however, but the previous-generation version of its smallest smart speaker. The promotion is available to new and current Premium subscribers. Premium members simply can log into their Spotify account through this web page and indicate whether they have an Individual or Family plan and their Google Home Mini will be reserved. An email will then be sent to confirm the allocation. This will be followed by another email which links to Google’s online store, where a discount code will be added to the Google Home Mini, making it free. The offer is not applicable to free trials of the Premium service or Premium Student accounts. Premium Family plan subscribers who claimed a free Google Home Mini speaker during a similar Spotify promotion last year are also not eligible for another unit. There is bad news for South African subscribers, however, as this free offer is not available locally. Upon accessing the redemption page, users in South Africa are presented with the following message: “We’re sorry, but this offer is not available in your country.”
