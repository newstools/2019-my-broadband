Telkom is actively cutting off ADSL subscribers across South Africa as part of its plan to completely decommission its copper network. Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko said they are moving to newer technologies which would help the company save on legacy network maintenance and the cost to replace stolen cables. Decommission its copper network and cutting off ADSL subscribers is paired with Telkom’s aggressive migration strategy. The company began by announcing the closure of its prepaid fixed-line voice services, and has quickly moved on to migrating users on more popular products. It is also contacting subscribers to migrate them from ADSL onto fibre or fixed-LTE. Telkom previously said it made good progress with its DSL to fibre migrations over the past few months, but it could not give an update on this process. “We cannot comment on the below questions [related to disconnecting copper and ADSL subscribers] as the Telkom Group is in a closed period until 12 November 2019,” it said. Telkom said it is actively contacting its ADSL customers to offer them comparable products on newer technologies. It added that these offers are often cheaper or include better speeds and data capacities than the customer’s current packages. Many Telkom customers, however, said they were left without connectivity after their ADSL connection was cut. The reasons for a lack of connectivity include not having any LTE or fibre from Telkom in the area and being offered an LTE connection which does not work. DSL offers a relatively fast and affordable Internet connection to many households, which is not easy to duplicate without fibre connectivity. There are, however, many wireless options which can be used as an ADSL replacement which typically offer higher speeds but with a lower monthly usage limit. Here is a breakdown of technologies and packages which will suit certain segments of ADSL subscribers looking for alternative options.
