Takealot recently partnered with Samsung to offer South Africans the opportunity to win a free TV if the Springboks win the Rugby World Cup. Customers who purchased a selected Samsung TV during the promotional period will receive a full refund from Takealot if the Springboks win the Rugby World Cup. Just under 400 units were made available for three TVs: the Samsung 49-inch Curved UHD TV, Samsung 50-inch UHD TV, and Samsung 55-inch QLED TV. The promotional TVs have now sold out, with no more models available for purchase. Ahead of the final against England this weekend, the 346 customers who purchased qualifying TVs during the promotional period will be refunded the full value of their purchases if the Springboks win the tournament. “As a proudly South African company, Takealot’s #backthebucks promotion is a way to support the Boks and rally even more ‘gees’ around an extraordinary tournament,” Takealot said. “As we head into the finals, now’s the time to unite behind the Bokke and send them good vibes as they tackle England on Saturday.” The Samsung TVs which formed part of the promotion are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-318945" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-318947" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-318941" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TV-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
