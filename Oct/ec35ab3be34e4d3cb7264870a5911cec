Twitter said it is suffering outages on its platform which are particularly affecting TweetDeck users. However, the outage is also preventing some users of its standard platform from seeing new direct messages, while other users are struggling to add media to their tweets – such as photos, videos, and polls. “We’ve been experiencing outages across Twitter and TweetDeck,” tweeted the company. “You might have had trouble Tweeting, getting notifications, or viewing DMs. We’re currently working on a fix, and should be back to normal soon.” TweetDeck is a Twitter account management platform that allows users to manage several timelines and accounts at the same time. While it is typically used by businesses and agencies that need to manage several social media accounts, it is also used by some personal users who prefer its interface. DownDetector reflects a small but noticeable increase in complaints regarding Twitter from South Africans this morning, although it appears that the US and Japan are the countries worst affected. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321864" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Twitter-outage.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Twitter-outage.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Twitter-outage-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Twitter-outage-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-321862" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/downdetector-640x308.png" alt="downdetector" width="640" height="308" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/downdetector-640x308.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/downdetector-600x289.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/downdetector-768x370.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/downdetector-1200x578.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/downdetector.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Twitter also announced yesterday that it has rolled out a feature for its Android, iOS, and web platforms that will filter unwanted direct messages. Users will now find an “additional messages” folder under “Message requests” in their inbox. This means that Twitter users can interact with people they don’t follow without exposing themselves to abuse from strangers.
