South Africans with Cell C fixed-LTE broadband packages from local ISPs will be able to switch to MTN fixed-LTE products before their service is shut down. This follows after Cell C confirmed it was discontinuing its fixed-LTE services through Internet Solutions, which will effectively end the product’s availability to local ISPs. Webafrica’s Greg Wright told MyBroadband that around 60,000 customers would be affected by this change across all ISPs, according to their estimates. “Webafrica has a significant number of these customers,” he said. Cell C has set deadlines for the shutdown of its fixed-LTE base: users with 100GB and 200GB packages will be deactivated on 30 November 2019, and customers on 20GB and 50GB packages will be shut down on 31 March 2020. Axxess said that Cell C fixed-LTE customers have no reason for concern, however, as it will be able to offer an equivalent service on MTN’s network. A MyBroadband forum user recently posted a communication from Axxess which stated that all 100GB and 200GB Cell C services would be replaced by equivalent MTN products during November 2019. Axxess told customers that their packages’ data allocations and pricing would remain the same on MTN’s network – R530 for 100GB and R845 for 200GB. Below is a screenshot of the notification Axxess sent to its subscribers. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-325413" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Axxess-MTN-email-640x369.jpg" alt="Axxess MTN email" width="640" height="369" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Axxess-MTN-email-640x369.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Axxess-MTN-email-600x346.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Axxess-MTN-email-768x443.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Axxess-MTN-email.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MyBroadband spoke to Axxess, which confirmed that it would replace Cell C fixed-LTE packages MTN products. “We will be replacing our Cell C LTE clients’ services with matching MTN fixed-LTE services during the month of November,” Axxess told MyBroadband. “The service size and pricing will remain the same.” Axxess added that customers with 20GB and 50GB Cell C fixed-LTE packages would be offered the same deal soon, although their Cell C services will remain active until next year. “Axxess clients with 20GB and 50GB Cell C services will soon be notified about their replacement dates, but their service will still remain active until March 2020,” the ISP said. MyBroadband reached out to MTN for comment on this replacement service. The mobile operator said it was unable to provide any insight into Cell C’s current plans. “MTN does not have visibility on Cell C’s current plans or options available to Cell C customers around winding down fixed-LTE services and therefore cannot comment,” said MTN SA executive for corporate affairs Jacqui O’Sullivan. O’Sullivan did confirm that MTN would offer wholesale fixed-LTE capability through South African ISP’s, however. “Negotiations with various partners are ongoing, with some already finalised,” O’Sullivan said.
