SEACOM has rolled out fibre services along the N1, which connect Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, and Cape Town, as part of a national expansion. This follows its acquisition of FibreCo earlier this year, and will immediately see Bloemfontein and Worcester benefit from 100Gbps speeds. Colesberg, Beaufort West, Laingsburg, and Touwsrivier will also benefit from 10Gbps speeds as a result of this rollout. According to SEACOM, this will allow customers to benefit from a range of new options, including: According to SEACOM, more capacity will be added along key national routes which connect Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, Durban, East London, and Kimberly in the next phase of its rollout. “Our continued investment in open-access infrastructure enables us to respond to the growing needs of our customers,” said SEACOM. The move the comes after SEACOM recently announced it was cutting off ISPs as part of a new peering policy. SEACOM said it reviewed its open peering policy and decided to change to selective peering with immediate effect. This means that many local ISPs will no longer be able to freely and openly share traffic directly with SEACOM.
