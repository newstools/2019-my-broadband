Google has launched its new Pixel Buds wireless earphones. The Pixel Buds come in a simple, round form factor with a stabilizer arc that tucks into the ear – ensuring that it fits comfortably and does not fall out when you are exercising. They use a hybrid design that allows you to listen to high-quality sound without losing track of what is happening around you. The Pixel Buds achieve this by “gently sealing” the ear to isolate louder outside sounds, ensuring that you remain safe while on the go. These earbuds also use Adaptive Sound technology which dynamically adjusts the volume of your audio as you move into louder or softer environments – ensuring you won’t need to adjust the volume depending on where you are. Each Pixel Bud has two microphones embedded within it which will focus on your voice while minimising environmental sounds – a feature which Google said “extends to the most challenging environments.” Google also said that the Pixel Buds use long-range Bluetooth connectivity to allow users to stay connected to their device as far as three rooms away when indoors, or the distance of a football field if you are outside. They can pair with devices that use Bluetooth 4.0 or later, including laptops, tablets, and devices that use either iOS or Android 6.0 or later. Google’s Pixel Buds will be available in 2020 in the US in four colours – Clearly White, Oh So Orange, Quite Mint, and Almost Black – and will cost $179. No South African pricing or availability information was available at the time of publishing. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323406" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel-buds-2-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel-buds-2-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel-buds-2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel-buds-2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel-buds-2.png 744w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323404" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel_Buds-639x430.png" alt="Pixel_Buds" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel_Buds-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel_Buds-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel_Buds-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel_Buds.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
