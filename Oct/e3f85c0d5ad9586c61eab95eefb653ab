Microsoft’s latest cumulative update for Windows 10 is reportedly causing problems with the operating system’s Start Menu. The KB4517389 patch was released on 8 October and was meant to fix bugs from a previous update, which resulted in issues with printing. Although this problem seems to have been resolved, several users on the Microsoft community forum and Reddit have now reported receiving a “Critical Error” message when trying to use the Start Menu and Search feature after installing the latest Windows 10 update. Microsoft’s support documentation indicates that the company believes the issue is not impacting a large number of users, though it is investigating the complaints. Windows 10 users have vented their frustration at bugs in recent faulty updates, which have caused issues with CPU drain, audio and PIN authentication, among others. Many skeptics of the current OS have stuck to Windows 7, which still enjoys a market share of 30% on desktop PCs. Microsoft is urging users to upgrade to Windows 10, as it is officially suspending support for Windows 7 as of 14 January 2020. After this date, the operating system will no longer receive security updates or software support.
