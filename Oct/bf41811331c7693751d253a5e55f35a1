Eskom has announced it will implement stage 1 load-shedding on Saturday 19 October from 09:00 until 23:00. The power utility stated that the system remains under severe pressure following issues earlier this week, with several generation units being out of service. “Recovery efforts are underway to fix coal handling issues at Medupi and to expedite the return of units that experienced technical problems,” Eskom said. “Our emergency response command centre will be meeting early tomorrow to asses the progress overnight and the prognosis for the weekend and coming week.” This follows after Eskom acting CEO Jabu Mabuza initially stated on Thursday 17 October that Eskom expected no load-shedding on Saturday 19 October. However, this announcement preceded the loss of extra power units at Medupi due to coal and ash handling issues. This setback resulted in Friday’s load-shedding being escalated to stage 2, as well as a change in the projections for the weekend’s controlled blackouts. “We hope to have recovered adequately by Sunday so that South Africans can enjoy watching the Sprinkgboks playing in the World Cup,” Eskom said. “We will keep South Africans informed about the status of the electricity system and our recovery efforts throughout this period.”
