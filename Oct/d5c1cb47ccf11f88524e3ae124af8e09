Google has confirmed that an update to its Google Home and Google Home Mini smart speakers is leaving some of these devices unusable. Rachel Chambers, a Google employee, responded to several complaints from users, stating that the company had noted the issue and was working on solving it. “The team is aware of these specific issues with both Google Home Minis and Google Home devices becoming unresponsive and we’re actively working on a fix,” Chambers said. Affected devices can be identified by the fact that the four lights on the device – which usually indicate whether the device is listening to you – remain on permanently. The issue doesn’t appear to affect any other Google smart speaker devices, such as the Google Home Max and the Google Home Hub. “It has been very difficult for our team to diagnose this issue and we understand why many of you have been frustrated with this ongoing process,” Chambers added. For this reason, Google is replacing all affected devices – regardless of whether they are under warranty – until it is able to come up with a fix. “Our support team will be reaching out to customers on this thread via private messaging to further address this issue and come to a resolution,” said Chambers.
