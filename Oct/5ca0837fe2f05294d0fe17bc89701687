There are few things as scary to computer users as the possibility of deleting files by mistake. This is compounded if these files are deleted from your recycle bin – as it would appear that there is no way to retrieve these files. Thankfully, EaseUS offers powerful data recovery software that can be used to retrieve seemingly lost files from your libraries and storage devices such as memory cards, hard drives, and recycle bin files. EaseUS makes data recovery incredibly simple with its Data Recovery Wizard, which is available as a free download for up to 2GB of file recovery. It is available for both PC and Mac, and you can upgrade to the pro version if you want to recover more than 2GB of files. Executing a file retrieval is incredibly simple, and can be done by someone without previous recovery experience. The process requires just three clicks, and you can preview all available files for recovery before deciding which you would like to restore. To recover your last data, follow the following steps. 1. Launch EaseUS, and select the location that you want to scan for deleted data. Possible locations to scan include specific locations such as Desktop or Documents, or you can select an entire storage device. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-325477" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-1-614x430.png" alt="EaseUS Step 1" width="640" height="448" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-1-614x430.png 614w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-1-571x400.png 571w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-1-768x538.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-1.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> 2. Initiate the two-part scan. First, a quick scan will look for all files in the location that were either deleted or emptied from the recycle bin. Then, a more in-depth scan will begin, which will search the entire data area of the storage device or library, rather than just scanning the file directory. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-325479" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2-614x430.png" alt="EaseUS Step 2" width="640" height="448" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2-614x430.png 614w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2-571x400.png 571w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2-768x538.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-325481" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2b-614x430.png" alt="EaseUS Step 2b" width="640" height="448" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2b-614x430.png 614w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2b-571x400.png 571w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2b-768x538.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EaseUS-Step-2b.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> 3. Look through all recoverable files, and select which files you would like to restore. Then click “recover” and your files will be restored. Do not save these files back onto the same hard drive partition or device that you lost the data from originally. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-325483" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ease-US-Step3-614x430.png" alt="Ease US Step3" width="640" height="448" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ease-US-Step3-614x430.png 614w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ease-US-Step3-571x400.png 571w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ease-US-Step3-768x538.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ease-US-Step3.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The EaseUS data recovery software is multi-faceted piece of software, and it has a variety of valuable features.
