Apple has requested that suppliers increase the production of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro by as much as 10%, reports the Nikkei Asian Review. An anonymous source told the publication that these additional 8 million units will help the Apple satisfy demand for its latest range of iPhones, which is higher than expected. “This autumn is so far much busier than we expected,” said the source. “Previously, Apple was quite conservative about placing orders. After the increase, prepared production volume for the iPhone 11 series will be higher compared to last year,” the source said. According to this source, the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro are the most in-demand smartphones, and Apple is lowering its production for the iPhone 11 Pro Max as a result. This news comes as a surprise given Apple’s history when it comes to managing demand. After the launch of the iPhone X, Apple was reportedly disappointing with its performance in the market. Device assemblers also reported a sharp decline in demand just a few months after the smartphone was released. Apple also cancelled a planned production boost for the iPhone Xr in November 2018, as it did not expect the iPhone Xr to meet its holiday season plans for the device. For now, however, the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro ranges appear to be reversing this trend.
