Discovery has announced major changes to its rewards programmes, shutting down Vitality rewards in favour of a single unified rewards currency – Discovery Miles. “From January 2020, we’ll be phasing out Vitality reward points to make way for one rewards currency, Discovery Miles,” the company stated on its website. If Discovery members have any Vitality rewards points left over on 1 January 2020, they will be converted to Miles at an exchange rate of 1 Vitality reward point to 6 Discovery Miles. “You won’t have to worry about rewards expiring anytime soon, because Discovery Miles remain valid for five whole years,” Discovery added. Activities that previously earned reward points will now earn Discovery Miles, with members able to earn up to 300 Discovery Miles every week by achieving all three Vitality Active Rewards goals – Exercise, Drive, and Money. In addition to being redeemed for various discounts, Discovery Miles can also be converted to cash if you use a Discovery Bank account.
