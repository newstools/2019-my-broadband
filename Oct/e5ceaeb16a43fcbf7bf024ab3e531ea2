Corsair has unveiled the world’s first commercially available 5,000MHz DDR4 RAM. The Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 5,000MHz 16GB kit, consisting of two 8GB modules, is priced at $1,080 (R15,920) when ordered directly from the manufacturer’s website. The Micron-based memory has CL18 timings with tested latencies of 18-26-26-46. While most DDR4 memory modules typically require between 1.2V and 1.4V, these 5,000MHz sticks run at 1.5V. With regards to platform support, Corsair has confirmed that the memory can reach the 5,000MHz speed while running on a valid motherboard sporting a Ryzen 3000 processor. Corsair recommends installing the kit in motherboards from the MSI X570 series that support automated overclocking. This includes the MEG X570 Godlike, MEG X570 Ace, MEG X570 Unify, and Prestige X570 Creation. To keep the kit running smoothly at peak usage, Corsair also bundles a Vengeance Airflow cooler with the memory sticks. Since increased memory size would normally be more beneficial than higher memory speeds, the real-use benefits of such a high memory speed would be negligible in mainstream gaming. However, the 5,000MHz mark represents a notable achievement for the memory maker with regards to advancements in integrated circuit manufacturing.
