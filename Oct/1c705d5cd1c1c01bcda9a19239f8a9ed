Apple users are complaining that iOS 13 is draining their battery in just a few hours, the Daily Mail reported. “Apple iOS 13.1.3 update is killing my iPhone 7 plus battery. Getting 70% battery drain in 2 hrs,” said one user. The user, along with many others, has also claimed that their iPhone is heating up abnormally, and is lagging as a result. This issue does not appear to be limited to older iPhones such as the iPhone 7 –  it has been reported that this issue affects all iPhones that support iOS 13. The problem also has not been fixed in newly- patched versions of the operating system, with users who have upgraded to the latest 13.1.3 version of the OS still complaining about the issue. Just six days after the launch of iOS 13, Apple released its first major update for the operating system – iOS 13.1. This update was nearly a week ahead of schedule, and addressed a bug that allowed attackers to bypass the lock screen of iPhones. It also addressed other bugs and added several features that were not ready to be launched in the initial roll-out of iOS 13. These included Automations within Shortcuts and Share ETA – which allows users to share their estimated time of arrival with their friends and contacts. Apple has since released two further patches – 13.1.2 and 13.1.3, which address more bugs found within iOS 13.
