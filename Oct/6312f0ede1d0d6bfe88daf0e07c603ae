Essential has unveiled images of its new Project GEM smartphone, which sports an extremely tall and slim design. The company tweeted two official images of the new handset, which includes a colour-changing metallic finish and a single rear-mounted camera. “We’ve been working on a new device to reframe your perspective on mobile,” Essential said. “It’s now in early testing with our team outside the lab.” Essential founder Andy Rubin also shared images of the new device on Twitter, stating that it employed a new user interface to accommodate its radically different form factor. Images of the user interface show that it places multiple card-like applications in a portrait orientation. The handset itself has a large physical button and volume rocker along its right edge, and a physical fingerprint sensor below the camera on its rear panel. According to a report by XDA Developers, the new Essential Project GEM smartphone could run Android and may be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 processor. There is currently no release date or pricing information for Essential’s upcoming Project GEM smartphone. The device will be available in a number of different colours which change depending on viewing angle, as shown in the video below:  <img class="aligncenter wp-image-322618" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Essential-GEM-2.jpg" alt="Essential GEM 2" width="640" height="793" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Essential-GEM-2.jpg 1123w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Essential-GEM-2-323x400.jpg 323w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Essential-GEM-2-768x951.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Essential-GEM-2-347x430.jpg 347w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
