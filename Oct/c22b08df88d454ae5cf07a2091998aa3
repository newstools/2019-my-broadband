Google revealed its Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones at its Made By Google event. These new devices both feature improved camera systems and software, as well as a number of new sensors which enable the Motion Sense capabilities. By using an integrated Soli radar chip, the Pixel 4 can read gestures in front of the smartphone, which lets you control the device without directly touching it. Google stated that the Motion Sense gesture processing happens offline on your device and can easily be turned off. In addition to a radar-powered gesture sensor, the Pixel 4 also includes new voice recording software which can transcribe speech while recording audio. The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL boast 5.7-inch and 6.2-inch OLED displays respectively, with both panels boasting 90Hz refresh rates. Google also lauded the capabilities of its dedicated Neural Core platform for on-device processing and offline machine learning. “With 6GB RAM, a 90hz display, and Pixel Neural Core, Pixel 4 is fast and powerful,” Google said. “Pixel Neural Core is the engine for on-device processing, always-on computing, and machine learning, meaning more tasks are done on the device for performance and privacy.” Google has also improved the camera on its Pixel devices, implementing dual-lens systems on the rear of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL by adding on a new telephoto lens. “When you combine this new hardware feature with our Super Res Zoom software, it gives you exceptional image quality – even from a distance,” Google said. Pixel 4 comes in three colours, including Clearly White, Just Black, and a limited edition colour named Oh So Orange. Google said customers can pre-order the Pixel 4 in the United States today, and the phones will ship on 24 October. Pricing is shown below: It is uncertain whether the Pixel 4 will be available in South Africa.
