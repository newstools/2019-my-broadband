Indonesian investigators found scores of problems and missteps in connection with last year’s fatal Lion Air crash, ranging from design flaws in Boeing Co.’s 737 Max airplane to certification failures by U.S. regulators and pilot error. Eighty-nine significant findings are listed in connection with the disaster, according to an extract from the final crash report distributed to stakeholders and seen by Bloomberg News. One major point of focus is a flight-control feature called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which has also been implicated in an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March. A spokesman for Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee declined to comment on the report, which is scheduled to be publicly released later Friday. Boeing declined to comment ahead of the report’s official release. Minutes after taking off on the morning of Oct. 29, Lion Air Flight 610 nosedived into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people on board. Indonesia’s investigation said an angle-of-attack sensor sent erroneous messages that activated the MCAS, “startling” the flight crew. The report said Boeing didn’t submit the required documentation about the MCAS function, and that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration failed to provide sufficient oversight of the company. “The flight crew should have been made aware of MCAS which would have provided them with awareness of the system and increase their chances of being able to mitigate the consequences,” the report said. “Flight crew training would have supported the recognition of abnormal situations and appropriate flight crew action.”
