Uber has launched UberGO in East London, which will become the sixth South African city where Uber is available. UberGO is a more affordable ride option than UberX which uses standard cars with a low fuel consumption such as Toyota Vitz and Toyota Premio, making it a good choice for smaller cities where most trips won’t be very long. The service is already available in Port Elizabeth. UberGO in East London will have the following costs: “In the last year, we have seen the Uber app opened over 100 000 times in East London, which is a clear indication that there is a high demand to use the app,” said Uber country manager Nduduzo Nyanda. “The way people move and work in their cities are changing, and we see positive regulatory momentum for ride-sharing across South Africa.” “We are partnering with cities throughout South Africa to address their growing transportation needs and to shape the future of urban mobility together. Thanks to these efforts, we are excited to be launching in East London” UberGO will only be available in the city of East London, as well as select parts of the Buffalo City Municipality. “While we build supply, demand might be high at launch so riders may not be able to get a ride immediately,” said Uber. “We encourage riders to continue to check the app for availability.”
