The South African Post Office (SAPO) has launched a new marketing campaign promising to deliver parcels without delays or problems. “The South African Post Office now delivers parcels efficiently and without delays with the margins of error reduced to zero percent,” the SAPO said in its latest marketing campaign. “Customers now receive SMS notifying them about their parcel. Call us today – 0860 111 502 our well-trained staff are on standby to assist you,” it added. The Post Office previously struggled to deliver parcels on time, with many customers complaining about long delays and lost packages.

He said ecommerce would play a big part in the Post Office’s future, as it can deliver parcels to areas where other companies do not have a presence. According to Barnes, the move to become a strong ecommerce player would be a big revenue stream for the Post Office. He added that the Post Office was investing in its infrastructure and working with “local and international online retail players”. The biggest hurdle to the SA Post Office’s ecommerce quest is reliability – local online shops and consumers do not trust the organisation to deliver packages on time. If the SA Post Office can indeed deliver parcels on time with zero errors, as promised, it will go a long way towards creating trust among local ecommerce stakeholders. MyBroadband asked the SA Post Office for comment regarding its latest marketing campaign, but the company did not reply by the time of publication.
