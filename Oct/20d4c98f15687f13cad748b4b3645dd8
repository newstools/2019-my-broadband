Facebook is reportedly testing end-to-end encryption in video and audio calls in the Messenger app. Technology and app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted a screenshot of the function within Messenger’s Secret Conversation interface. Wong also added that Facebook plans to deploy its own voice assistant to the app. Facebook first introduced Secret Conversation in 2016, allowing users to chat securely with only the sender and receiver able to read the messages. To use the encrypted functionality, a user must click on their profile picture, scroll to Secret Conversation and turn it on. The user can also enable the automatic deletion of messages after a preset time. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed plans to enhance privacy on Facebook’s platforms by adding end-to-end encryption across all its messaging services earlier this year. The company has already introduced encryption in Whatsapp and wants to employ it on Instagram. The move has upset US lawmakers, with the US Department of Justice expressing its concern about the policy in a letter directed to Zuckerberg. Authorities are worried that the encryption would make it difficult to investigate criminal activities which are facilitated on Facebook’s messaging services such as the distribution of child pornography, terrorism, and extortion.
