9to5Google has published leaked images of a prototype unit of Google’s next laptop, the Pixelbook Go. The report included multiple images of the new device as well as a detailed hands-on video of the prototype. The bottom of the laptop appears to be its most distinguishable external feature, sporting a series of grooves that create a ribbed texture. The lid of the laptop has a more conventional matte finish. For connectivity, the prototype unit sports a USB-C port on each side of the laptop, as well as a 3.5mm audio jack on the left side. The video also illustrates the audio quality of the prototype’s two front-facing speakers, which according to 9to5Google, deliver exceptional sound. The laptop will run Google’s Chrome OS. An earlier leak by 9to5Google revealed that the Pixelbook Go could be available in a range of specifications. The lower-end unit that was provided for this preview features a 13.3-inch full HD touch screen, Intel Core M3 processor, and 8GB RAM. According to the report, the top tier model will boast a 4K “Molecular Display”, an Intel Core i7 processor, and 16GB RAM. The Pixelbook Go is expected to be officially unveiled at Google’s October 15th Pixel 4 event.
