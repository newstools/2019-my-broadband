FNB has opened up its mobile banking app to all consumers in South Africa, regardless of whether they currently bank with FNB. This will allow non-FNB customers to explore the benefits of the bank’s mobile app as well as stand a chance to win one of two R1-million grand prizes by simply downloading the app and using a digital account with no monthly fees. FNB added that existing customers are similarly encouraged to experience the bank’s technology by performing their day-to-day banking via the app or using some of its unique features. “We are delighted to offer all South Africans the opportunity to experience the benefits of managing their money using our app,” said FNB retail chief executive Raj Makanjee. “While FNB offers several interfaces to consumers, we find that our App is a convenient, safe, and cost-effective way for customers to manage their day-to-day banking needs.” The FNB app includes features such as nav Money, nav Wellness, and nav Car, which allow users to manage their monthly spend, health and fitness, and vehicle payments respectively. “We are confident that any consumer can get better value from banking with FNB, which is why we encourage everyone to put us to the test. For the first time in South Africa, any consumer can experience our innovative services that were only available to our customers,” said FNB Consumer CEO Christoph Nieuwoudt. “This includes real-time account opening, Cardless Cash Withdrawals, Bank Card Management, Geo Payments for direct payments to another FNB App user, eBucks suite of services and app-based instant messaging with our bankers.” The FNB mobile banking app is available from the Google Play Store and the App Store.
