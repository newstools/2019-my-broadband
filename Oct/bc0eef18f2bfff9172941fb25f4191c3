In anticipation for the reveal of its first electric vehicle next month, Lexus has unveiled an otherworldly concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show. With the LF-30 Electrified concept vehicle, Lexus imagines several ambitious features, such as gesture control, a luggage-carrying drone, autonomous driving capability, and augmented reality, which could possibly be used in future vehicles. The external shape of the vehicle is that of a coupe with a flowing front that shifts into a more angular rear end. The LF-30 can transport four occupants, with the front two seats’ designs “echoing that of a first-class seat on an airliner”. The rear seats use artificial muscle technology to mold to the body shape of the passenger. A massive windshield covers the car all the way from the front, over its top and towards the rear. Lexus envisions that the glass opacity could be adjusted and be used as a display for media, navigation and augmented reality elements such as starlit skies. Artificial intelligence could help streamline personal preferences like temperature and audio for the vehicle’s occupants using voice recognition. For improved handling, the LF-30 also employs in-wheel electric motors and a steer-by-wire driving system. The LF-30 boasts a 110kWh battery pack and would conceivably accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.8 seconds. The photos below show renders of the Lexus LF-30 Electrified concept car. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324561 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_04_2000x1100-640x352.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_04_2000x1100-640x352.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_04_2000x1100-600x330.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_04_2000x1100-768x422.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_04_2000x1100-1200x660.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324563 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_06_2000x1100-640x352.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_06_2000x1100-640x352.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_06_2000x1100-600x330.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_06_2000x1100-768x422.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_06_2000x1100-1200x660.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324565 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_09_2000x1100-640x352.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_09_2000x1100-640x352.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_09_2000x1100-600x330.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_09_2000x1100-768x422.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_09_2000x1100-1200x660.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324567 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_10_2000x1100-640x352.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_10_2000x1100-640x352.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_10_2000x1100-600x330.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_10_2000x1100-768x422.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lexus-FCV-F30_10_2000x1100-1200x660.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
