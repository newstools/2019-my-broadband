Valve has launched a beta version of Remote Play Together, which allows Steam users to play local co-op and shared/split-screen games online. This will only require the host of the session to own the game, as the other gamers will connect to the host’s game via Steam’s Remote Play streaming technology. To use the feature, you will have to join the Steam beta. Once you have done this, you can simply enter a game, launch a local multiplayer session, and invite friends to your session by right-clicking on their name in your friend list and choosing “Remote Play Together”. According to Valve, all of your friends’ controllers will function as if they are connected to your computer directly, and all voice chat and audio options will be available in a single control panel. Valve added that when you are hosting a Remote Play Together session, your friends will only be able to see the contents of your game window – never your desktop or other personal data. The Remote Play Together feature will also allow gamers across PC, Mac, and Linux devices to play together. Valve noted that during the beta period, it would be focusing on improving network stability and compatibility across a variety of hardware.
