Eskom has announced that it does not plan to implement load-shedding today. However, the power utility said that this could change at short notice owing to the “constrained and volatile” power grid. “Load-shedding could be implemented at short notice should there be a significant shift in plant performance and increased unplanned technical breakdowns,” said Eskom in a press release. “We will keep customers informed of the status of the electricity system.” “We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and would like to thank customers for their support in reducing demand by using electricity sparingly and industrial customers for their participation in load curtailment, when necessary.” Eskom added that while some units returned to service yesterday as expected, the power utility had to use emergency diesel and water reserves to supplement its capacity. This was due to other generating units returning later than had originally been expected. The power utility also said that plans are “progressing well” to repair the conveyor belt at Medupi to achieve full operation. The power utility noted that parts of the country are experiencing a heat wave, and said that while it understood that many South Africans were using air conditioners, it requested that they use them “efficiently at 23 degrees Celsius.” #POWERALERT 3
