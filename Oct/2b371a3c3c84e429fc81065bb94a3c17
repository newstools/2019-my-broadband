Samsung has released a video on its YouTube page which shows OLED TV owners how to check for “burn-in” on their displays. The video displays a red rectangle while music plays, and users are then given examples of how to spot burn-in on the display. In the video, the burn-in manifests as vague black shapes over the red background. Burn-in is the “permanent image retention” caused by leaving a static image on a screen for a long period of time. OLED TVs are susceptible to this due to the way their pixels self-illuminate to display images. The Samsung video then goes on to state that OLED TV users with burn-in can purchase a “burn-in free” Samsung QLED TV. Samsung’s QLED TVs – which use LED backlighting – compete against LG’s OLED TVs in the premium TV market space. Both manufacturers have released models which support 8K resolutions.
