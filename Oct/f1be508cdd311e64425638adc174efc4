WhatsApp is expanding the availability of its group privacy settings to beta users outside of India, WABetaInfo reports. “With these new features, users will have more control over the group messages they receive,” WhatsApp said upon announcing the features in April. To access these features, you will need to update your WhatsApp application to the latest beta version for iOS or Android. Then, you must navigate to WhatsApp Settings > Account > Privacy > Groups. From this menu, you will be able to control a variety of settings that will only be applied when you communicate in WhatsApp groups, including: Users will also be able to decide who can automatically add them to groups – including options to allow anyone or only people in your contacts list. If you choose the latter, you will be able to use a new blacklist feature to select contacts which are excluded from adding you to a group automatically. This feature replaces the “Nobody” feature that was available in previous versions of the privacy settings, which only allowed users to choose between “Everyone,” “My Contacts,” or “Nobody.” Users who are not given the privilege to automatically add you to groups will still be able to invite you privately.
