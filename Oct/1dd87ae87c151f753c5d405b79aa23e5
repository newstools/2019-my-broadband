Mozilla has updated Firefox with tools that let users monitor how the browser has helped to protect their privacy. In June, Firefox added “Enhanced Tracking Protection”, a feature which blocks third-party tracking cookies and cryptominers. “Since 2 July we’ve blocked more than 450 billion tracking requests that attempt to follow you around the web,” Mozilla said. While this feature has been operating in the background, Mozilla wanted a way for users to see exactly how many attempts are made to tag and track their activity. “That’s why today we’re introducing a new feature that offers you a free report outlining the number of third-party and social media trackers blocked automatically by the Firefox browser with Enhanced Tracking Protection,” Mozilla said. Users can now access a dashboard of Firefox Privacy Protections, which includes several new functions: To access the dashboard, Firefox users can click on the shield icon to the left of the URL bar and select “Show Report”. Below is a video that shows how the new tools work. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
