Telkom is currently shutting down its copper network which has a direct impact on services like ADSL, VDSL, fax, and alarm systems. The company is already migrating ADSL and VDSL subscribers to its fibre and LTE networks, but that still leaves other systems which rely on copper vulnerable. Without copper lines, traditional fax machines, some alarm systems, and speed point machines will not work. The good news is that Telkom is currently testing a solution which will cater for fax, alarms, and speed point services on OTTV (IP voice). “The solution has been tested by Openserve and is ready for deployment,” Telkom told MyBroadband. This solution will enable customers to migrate their existing PSTN number to IP voice for faxing purposes. Telkom said it is currently documenting the official business process, so all relevant stakeholders are on board and approve the solution. “As soon as it is documented, and official brief will be sent to all channels,” Telkom said. Telkom will be moving ADSL subscribers to fibre in areas where the technology is available, as fibre is both cheaper and faster than copper-based broadband. Customers will be informed that ADSL is being turned off and that they will be migrated to new technology with a more attractive offering. This should result in minimal friction, as ADSL customers with capped accounts can often be upgraded to uncapped fibre products at a similar price. In areas where Telkom ADSL customers do not have fibre coverage, they will be offered a look-alike fixed-LTE service. This means that if you are using a capped ADSL connection at a fixed speed, you will be offered an LTE package with unlimited speed and the same cap. Customers with uncapped ADSL connections at a fixed speed will be offered a throttled LTE connection with uncapped data usage – subject to a fair usage policy.
