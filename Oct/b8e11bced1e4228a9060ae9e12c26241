The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has announced that it will broadcast the 2019 Rugby World Cup final between South Africa and England. The public broadcaster said it had reached an agreement with SuperSport to screen the game live on Saturday at 11:00. Additionally, the SABC will also broadcast the match between New Zealand and Wales on Friday 1 November at 11:00. “The SABC is excited to be able to bring this historic game to the nation, as the public broadcaster recognises the role it plays in social cohesion, nation-building and promoting sports of national interest,” said SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe. “We remain committed to entering into commercially viable agreements and we support and wish the Springboks well as they pursue a place in history,” Mxakwe added. This follows after Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi called on DStv to provide the public broadcaster with the rights to broadcast the World Cup semi-final and final. “For the sake of all South Africans, for today and the final, can DStv please provide the SABC the rights to broadcast the #RSAvWAL so that the country, not the privileged few can follow the Springboks,” Lesufi said on Twitter. Both matches will be screened live on SABC 2.
