NASA has revealed two new spacesuits which will be used in the space agency’s lunar exploration programme, Project Artemis. During a live broadcast, NASA presented the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU), a large red-white-and-blue suit, that will be worn by astronauts while working on the moon. The new suit will provide improved mobility, allowing astronauts to reach over their heads and across the suit, something which was not possible with the Apollo generation of spacesuits. Whereas astronauts like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had to bunny-hop clumsily across the moon’s surface, astronauts with the xEMU suit will now be able to simply walk. The other new spacesuit, the Orion crew survival suit, will be used during transit between Earth and the Moon. The thinner orange suit is designed to protect crew members in the event of a sudden depressurization of their spacecraft, providing life support for days. It will also regulate temperatures inside the suit with liquid cooling. NASA plans to put the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024. The space agency said it also intends to use modified versions of the Artemis spacesuits for future missions to Mars in the mid 2030’s. Below are pictures from the live reveal of NASA’s new spacesuits. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323474 size-medium" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-1-595x400.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-1.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 85vw, 595px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323482 size-medium" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-3-595x400.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-3-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-3.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 85vw, 595px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323478 size-medium" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-2-595x400.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Artemis-2.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 85vw, 595px" /> <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
