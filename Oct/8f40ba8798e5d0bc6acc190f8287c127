Sony has announced the official launch date for its upcoming PlayStation 5 console. “Since we originally unveiled our next-generation console in April, we know that there’s been a lot of excitement and interest in hearing more about what the future of games will bring,” Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan said. “Today I’m proud to share that our next-generation console will be called PlayStation 5, and we’ll be launching in time for Holiday 2020.” The company did not provide any additional information about the actual console, but it did provide some details regarding the new controller. Sony announced that it is adopting haptic feedback to replace traditional “rumble” technology for a better range of vibrations and improved immersion. The company added that it would also be changing the way its controllers’ triggers worked, giving developers the ability to manipulate the resistance of the triggers depending on in-game events. Previous reports have stated that Sony might launch its PlayStation 5 Pro console at the same time as its standard PlayStation 5, with the Pro model costing up to $150 more than the standard edition. It is unclear what additional features and performance the more expensive console would offer, as the standard model is reportedly already going to be capable of supporting 8K video and ray-tracing.
