Google has updated its range of office productivity apps for improved multitasking and streamlined functionality on mobile devices. The new versions of G Suite’s Docs, Slides, and Sheets for Android now sport a reworked look and several minor control changes. While the development team has not added any major new features, the updated visual design could serve to improve user experience, as well as to make the transition between the suite’s apps smoother. Google stated that some of the changes which users will immediately notice include “a restyled document list, highly-legible typefaces, consistent controls, and updated iconography”. The Google Drive app also saw a redesign on iOS and Android earlier this year, while the web versions of the Docs, Sheets and Slides platforms were also revamped. “This material redesign is part of a larger effort to bring consistency to the look and feel of our G Suite apps, with ease-of-use in mind,” Google said. Although the changes do not necessarily deliver a major change in the way these apps are used, writing and editing documents, spreadsheets, or slideshows on mobile could be slightly easier thanks to the overhauled interface.
