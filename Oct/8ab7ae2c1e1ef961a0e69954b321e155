Nvidia has launched the latest generation of its Shield TV set-top boxes for cloud-based gaming and media streaming. The company unveiled two new devices – the Shield TV and Shield TV Pro, which it said are intended for casual streamers and gaming enthusiasts alike. Nvidia’s new set-top boxes sport the company’s Tegra X1+ processor, which it claims is 25% faster than the previous-generation X1 chip. The Shield TV set-top boxes use artificial intelligence to allow for upscaling of 720p and 1080p video to 4K, and they also boast support for Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos surround sound. Built-in integration with Google Assistant means they also have voice control features. The Shield TV Pro features the same design as the previous-generation Shield TV device, and it offers 16GB of storage and 3GB RAM as well as two USB 3.0 ports. It can also serve as a Plex Media Server. The Shield TV has an unconventional tube-shaped design and sports 8GB of internal storage with 2GB RAM. It has an ethernet port and a microSD expansion slot. The Nvidia Shield TV is priced at $150 (R2,180), while the Shield TV Pro will set you back $200 (R2,910).
