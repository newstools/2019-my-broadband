The State Information Technology Agency (SITA) and Microsoft South Africa have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which will allow government departments to move their services to Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. The MOU, which was announced at the Govtech conference in Durban today, also sees government endorse Microsoft as a key partner to enable its digital transformation. “The inclusion of Microsoft in the government digital ecosystem is the first of many valued players that will collaborate with SITA to modernize and digitally transform government, enable new business outcomes and improve citizen experiences.” said Ntutule Tshenye, acting CEO of SITA. Lillian Barnard, MD of Microsoft South Africa, said that Microsoft welcomes the decision by SITA to sign the MOU. “At Microsoft it is important for us to partner with government departments to empower their digital transformation.” Microsoft launched its first South African data centres nearly six months ago, and the company said the adoption of its cloud services is gaining momentum in the country. “When we decided to invest in public cloud in South Africa we did so believing that it would have a dramatic impact on the country. Cloud technology will not only help the public sector to transform and optimise service delivery, and to create more engaged citizens and empowered employees, but will empower the private sector to innovate in ways that help to drive economic growth and job creation,” Barnard said.
