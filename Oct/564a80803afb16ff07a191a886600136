Samsung has announced its latest chipset, the Exynos 990. The company claims that the new chip’s octa-core CPU will deliver 20% more performance than the previous-generation Exynos 9820. It also employs a Mali-G77 GPU, which Samsung says will also boost graphical performance and power efficiency by 20%. The processor is manufactured using Samsung’s 7nm process node. The Exynos 990 also adds support for LPDDR5 memory, which is capable of data rates of up to 5,500Mbps. The processor boasts support for up to six cameras with a maximum resolution of 108MP and can also power displays with refresh rates of up to 120Hz. The Exynos 990 does not have built-in 5G capabilities, meaning it will likely feature in Samsung’s new 4G devices or be used with a separate 5G modem chip. For example, the Exynos 990 could also be paired with the 5G Exynos Modem 5123 – which was also announced today – to enable 5G support. The 5G modem features support for both sub-6GHz and millimetre-wave frequencies. According to Samsung, the Exynos Modem 5123 is capable of maximum download rates of 5.1Gbps in the sub-6GHz band and 7.53Gbps on millimetre waves. Samsung has not revealed which future phones will employ the new chipset or modem.
