As Bitcoin’s monster rally over the past few days loses steam, technical indicators show it could face further resistance at the $10,000 level. The largest digital currency gained nearly $2,500 at its peak this week following positive comments regarding blockchain technology from Chinese officials. But it hit a ceiling at $10,000, indicating that tougher times could lie ahead. For many investors, it will need to meaningfully breach that level for confirmation that the rally could continue, historical pricing patterns suggest. Bitcoin surged after China’s government embraced the digital token’s underlying blockchain technology. As the nation looks to gain advantages from digital finance, China’s President Xi Jinping said Beijing will increase investment in the technology. At the same time, a Chinese central bank official said it could help with commercial banks’ risk control, among other things. “For people who believe in it, they view it as a way to get around government and central bank control of currencies,” Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “Bitcoin’s a lot harder to control and lock down, so I think it makes sense that the actual and very specific use case for Bitcoin is playing out right now.” But the $10,000 level poses a psychological barrier, added Cruz. With investors continually debating whether or not it’s an asset or a currency, there is difficulty valuing it, “so it really has to trade off the technical levels,” he said. Bitcoin’s rally, which saw it gain as much as 16% on Monday, sputtered Tuesday after China’s state media warned investors should avoid speculative behavior following Jinping’s remarks. Among major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was the lone standout to sell-off on Tuesday, with other tokens gaining. It dropped as much as 2.7% to $9,200 in New York. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which tracks major digital assets, was up for a fourth straight day, climbing as much as 3.1% in Tuesday’s session.
