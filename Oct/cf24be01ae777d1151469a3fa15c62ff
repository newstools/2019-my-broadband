Fuel prices are expected to drop across the board in October, according to the AA, which was commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund (CEF). The AA said that the change in value of the Rand would have a minimal impact on the price of petrol, and international oil prices have declined slightly over the past month. “The Rand has pulled back from its high point at the start of October,” the AA said. “This ongoing decline in the average exchange rate has meant that most of its losses have been clawed back, and it will have only a modest impact on the fuel price.” As a result of these factors, the AA said it expects a drop of between 8 and 18 cents for petrol, 14 cents for diesel, and 21 cents for illuminating paraffin in November. The AA added that oil ticked up slightly since the end of October, which could be the start of a strengthening trend into November. Below is a summary of the price changes expected for November 2019: “Whatever happens to the oil price and Rand from this point affects the price motorists will be paying at the pumps at Christmas,” the AA said. “It remains to be seen whether this month’s reductions will continue for the rest of the year.”
