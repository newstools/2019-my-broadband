CareerJunction has released its latest CareerJunction Index (CJI) report, which shows that software development remains the most sought-after skill in South Africa. The CJI is based on data gathered from the CareerJunction website and monitors the labour market in South Africa by examining supply and demand trends. The latest CJI report shows that demand for software developers increased by 11% quarter-on-quarter. There is also a strong demand for middle-managers and department heads, which means they face positive employment prospects. “After a decrease in hiring activity for middle management staff during the second quarter of 2019, demand has stabilised,” the report states. There has been an increase in the number of IT jobs advertised in South Africa in recent months. “The marketing, ICT and business & management sectors saw a notable uptake in jobs since July 2019 as demand for these skills increased,” the report stated. This growth follows a significant decline over the past year, as shown in the graph below which displays volume trends for IT job adverts. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-324118" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICT-Jobs.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICT-Jobs.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICT-Jobs-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICT-Jobs-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
