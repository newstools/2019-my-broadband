According to Motsa, MTN is battling it out for market share over Fixed LTE coverage to the home. “We are currently focused on Fixed LTE penetration to the home. Historically, this is an area that hasn’t done very well. There are about 17 million homes in the country, and the majority of them are unconnected, which is why this is a big focus area for us,” said Motsa. “We’re also making sure that we’re building a strong network,improving our customer service and continuing to innovate. It’s simple – if we can get 5G spectrum, we’ll create wonders for the country,” added Motsa According to Motsa, other focus areas that the operator is looking into includes Fintech, which is a field where MTN see great opportunities. “This quarter, we are going to launch Mobile Money (MoMo) in South Africa,” Motsa said.
