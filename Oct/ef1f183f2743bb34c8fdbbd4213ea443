Delivering high-speed, reliable Wi-Fi to a large-scale event is no easy task, especially when a large number of delegates in attendance each have multiple connected devices. Comsol and Quick Connect Wireless did exactly this at the 2019 MyBroadband Conference, however. The event took place at the Gallagher Convention Centre on 17 October 2019. The conference had 2,500 delegates in the speaking hall and visiting the expo area at its peak. Comsol and Quick Connect Wireless delivered excellent, free connectivity to delegates for the duration of the event, with coverage across both the speaking hall and expo area. This was achieved using the latest Wi-Fi and networking technologies, and the companyâ€™s expertise in the events space. Quick Connect Wireless offers Wi-Fi solutions for a variety of deployments, from festivals and fixed-mobile Wi-Fi to residential applications. The company has been providing Wi-Fi since 2012 and has developed a proprietary technology which places it light years ahead of the competition. Comsol offers national coverage through its open-access network, combining the best of fibre and licensed wireless into a single solution. The company has also deployed a 5G network pilot in Soweto, Johannesburg, providing residents with free, high-speed connectivity.
