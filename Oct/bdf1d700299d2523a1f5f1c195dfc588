Samsung officially launched its Galaxy Fold smartphone in South Africa at an event in Sandton, Johannesburg. The device is currently available for pre-order and will ship to customers on 18 October 2019. The Galaxy Fold is priced at R43,999 and a limited number of the devices will be available to local buyers. Speaking at the event, Samsung Africa president and CEO Sung Yoon said that South Africa is among the first countries in the world to receive the foldable smartphone. Samsung has improved the smartphoneâ€™s design following the problems it experienced with the initial version of the device. The Galaxy Fold folds outwards like a book, with the main display on the inside. This means a physical hinge is placed on the side of the device when closed. The screen protector is now surrounded by a plastic rim to prevent accidental removal of the screen cover, and Samsung have implemented a few changes to the folding mechanism which make it more resistant to dust and debris. Specifications and images of the Samsung Galaxy Fold are detailed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-296710" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-open.jpg" alt="Fold open" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-open.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-open-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-open-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-296704" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-front.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-front.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-front-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-front-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-296708" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-Open-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-Open-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-Open-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-Open-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-296702" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-Colours.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-Colours.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-Colours-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-Colours-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
