EA has announced that it will begin releasing its PC games on Steam – eight years after it left the platform in favour of its Origin store. The first EA game that will launch on Steam is Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which will debut on 15 November. EA will make a variety of its other popular games available on Steam in the coming months, including FIFA 20, Apex Legends, Battlefield V, and The Sims 4. The company also plans to launch its EA Access subscription service on Steam, which allows users to access a broad collection of EA games. EA Access is not the same product as Origin Access, however, and it is expected that it will offer fewer games than the Origin service – making it similar to EA’s console subscription services. “This is the start of an exciting partnership with Valve that will see us innovating for PC players around the world,” said Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson. “Through our subscription, great games and more, we’re excited to bring players in the Steam and Origin communities together with access to the best games, whenever and wherever they want to play.” EA will not allow users who have purchased its games on Origin to transfer these games to Steam, meaning that if you want to play one of these games through Steam, you will have to purchase it again.
