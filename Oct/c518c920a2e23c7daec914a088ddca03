After a beta period in September, Valve has announced its redesigned Steam Library is now available to all users. The reworked Library interface sports a new look and several features that make it easier to view the game update details and track which games friends have been playing. The new Steam landing page allows for quick access to game updates, recently played titles, friends activity, and game collections. The Library home page now features a tab which shows which games your friends have been playing, while the game list will let you view what titles they are currently playing. A new in-Library Events feature will also provide notifications about what additions or changes have been made to the games in your library. Developers will be able to use an event creation tool to add details about patches, updates, and limited-time events. They will also be able to share developer live-streams and community challenges. Steamâ€™s Remote Play Together feature is also rolling out as part of the update. This allows Steam users to play local co-op and shared/split-screen games online, with only the host of the session requiring a copy of the game.
