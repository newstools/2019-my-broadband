Uber is releasing a new app with the aim of connecting businesses to part-time workers, according to a report by the Financial Times. The Uber Works app will be available from Friday in Chicago only, where the app has been tested in the last year. The company is reportedly considering a broader rollout in future. Jobseekers will be able to compare rates from different businesses and apply for shifts, as well as view information on the skill requirements, dress code, location, and working conditions of prospective job opportunities. Uber has stated that the app could make it easier for workers to apply for jobs by eliminating the need to retype and submit their information repeatedly. The company is currently facing potential stricter regulation of its services in various countries The passing of new legislation in California has also opened the door for so-called “gig workers”, like Uber drivers, to gain recognition as employees entitled to additional benefits including paid leave and medical cover. This would lead to increased operating costs for Uber. Because of this, the company is collaborating with staff agencies in the US for Uber Works, who will screen the potential workers and handle the temporary employees’ payment-related matters like payroll and tax.
