An issue with FNB’s online banking platforms is preventing clients with access bonds from transferring funds out of their home loan accounts through the FNB app and website. Clients have complained that the function to transfer funds out of their home loan accounts has been offline for more than a day, with no indication from the bank when the issue will be resolved. “FNB is aware that a small number of customers are unable to transfer funds from their flexi home loan facilities using our app or online banking,” FNB Digital spokesperson Kevin Mitchell told MyBroadband. Mitchell said that FNB is busy fixing the problem and will make contact with the affected customers. “To complete the relevant transactions, customers can also use FNB cellphone banking, contact centre, or our private banking suite,” Mitchell said. “We apologise to the affected customers for the inconvenience.” FNB recently came under fire for blocking the use of password managers for its online banking portal, with tech-savvy users pointing out that requiring users to input passwords manually could encourage the use of less secure passwords. Following backlash on social media, FNB backtracked on its decision and once again allowed the use of password managers for its online banking platform. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-324464" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FNB-flexi-home-loan-access-bond-issue.png" alt="Post on FNB Facebook page regarding flexi home loan access bond issue" width="485" height="264" />
