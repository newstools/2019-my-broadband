Samsung South Africa has released a statement confirming that its Galaxy Note 10 and S10 ranges of smartphones have suffered from a fingerprint recognition issue. “This issue involved ultrasonic fingerprint sensors unlocking devices after recognizing 3-dimensional patterns appearing on certain silicone screen protecting cases as users’ fingerprints,” Samsung South Africa said. The company recommended that Galaxy Note 10, Note 10+, S10, and S10+ owners who use silicone screen covers remove them, delete their current fingerprint, and register a new fingerprint on their device. “Please be sure to scan your fingerprint in its entirety, so that all portions of your fingerprint, including the centre and corners, have been fully scanned,” said Samsung. Samsung also confirmed that a new patch has been released in South Africa which fixes this issue, and the company recommended that users install this update. TechRadar previously reported that the flaw was discovered by a user who accidentally used the wrong thumb to unlock her Galaxy S10 smartphone. She then tested her husband’s thumb, which was also able to unlock the device. Numerous British banks blacklisted the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 smartphones from being used to authorise payments due to this biometric issue.
