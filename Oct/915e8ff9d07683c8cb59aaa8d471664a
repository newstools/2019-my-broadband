Blix, the creator of email client Blue Mail, has sued Apple for allegedly stealing technology from its “Share Email” feature and using it in its “Sign in with Apple” functionality. According to Blix, Blue Mail patented technology in 2017 which enables anonymous public messaging by letting users share a second, public address without giving away the details to their personal address. Apple’s “Sign in with Apple” feature uses similar functionality to log users in securely to websites and apps without sharing their personal email addresses. However, if Blix wins the lawsuit, it does not necessarily mean that Apple will have to change its “Sign in with Apple” feature. Instead, it may simply have to pay Blix to continue using this functionality. This is not the first time Blix has had a run-in with Apple regarding its Blue Mail email client. Blix has previously accused Apple of artificially lowering the ranking of Blue Mail on the App Store, with Blue Mail being pushed down from 13th to 143rd. The company also contended with Apple’s claim that it had removed BlueMail from the Mac App Store for copying another program called TypeApp. According to Blix, TypeApp had been removed voluntarily, and Apple was trying to create a monopoly over the market by reducing the number of competitors available on its App Store.
