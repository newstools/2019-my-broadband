Mobile network operator MTN has announced that it has now reached 95% 4G coverage across South Africa. The company made the announcement in a statement celebrating its 25th year of operation. “This month, as MTN celebrates 25 years of keeping the people of South Africa connected and having a positive impact on their lives, it is also proud to announce that it has reached 95% 4G coverage across South Africa – giving almost all of South Africa access to new and disruptive online services through a global, high-performing network,” the statement reads. The mobile operator also said that it provides broad 3G coverage in rural areas. MTN CEO Godfrey Motsa said the company’s network is “constantly evolving to handle increased demand and functionality”. MTN said that it has invested more than R40 billion over the last four years to improve its network coverage and quality. The company was the first South African mobile operator to pilot 4G networks in South Africa back in 2011. In addition to its 4G network, the company said that its fibre to the business network now spans more than 18,000 kilometres and boasts sufficient capacity to serve 30% of South Africa’s businesses.
