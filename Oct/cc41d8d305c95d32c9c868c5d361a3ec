Volkswagen has unveiled its new Golf – the Golf 8 – which includes petrol, diesel, and hybrid drive options. The new VW Golf will be available in a variety of configurations, based on the engine type of the vehicle. VW said the following petrol, diesel, and natural gas powertrain options will be available: The five hybrid models are then broken into two segments. One segment sees the vehicles combine a belt starter generator, 48V lithium-ion battery, and efficient TSI engines. These are the eTSI Golf models and offer the following power options: The other segment is a plug-in hybrid option, of which there are two cars at the following power output options: “Both Golf versions with plug-in hybrid drives will launch with a new 13kWh lithium-ion battery on board that enables larger electrically powered ranges of approximately 60km, and temporarily turns the Golf into a zero-emissions vehicle,” said VW. VW stated that the new Golf features displays and controls which are “consistently digitalised so their functions are self-explanatory”. “Practically all displays and controls are digital: the new instruments and online infotainment systems meld together into a display landscape featuring touch buttons and touch sliders. A windshield head-up display is optionally available to further enhance the range of information available.” The Golf is also the first VW car with Car2X communication fitted as standard, it added. Wheels24 reported that the new Golf will be available in South Africa in late 2020, with the GTI model the first to arrive. The TSI and R models will follow, it said. No information on the locally availability of the remaining models was provided at the time of writing. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324865 size-large"
