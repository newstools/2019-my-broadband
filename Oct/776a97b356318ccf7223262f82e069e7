Facebook will unveil a dedicated news section on Friday, according to The Washington Post. The tab will provide users with access to stories from around 200 news organizations, including the Wall Street Journal, Buzzfeed News, and The Washington Post. The shift will see Facebook re-entering the news delivery space, competing with the likes of Google and Apple. The company will use a combination of human curation and computer algorithms to deliver articles that cover a range of interests, such as politics, technology, sport, entertainment, and more. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg may have alluded to the new feature while testifying before the US House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday. “Later in this week we actually have a big announcement coming up on launching a big initiative around news and journalism where we’re partnering with a lot of folks to build a new product that’s supporting high-quality journalism,” Zuckerberg said. “I think there’s an opportunity within Facebook and our services to build a dedicated surface – a tab within the apps, for example – where people who really want to see high-quality, curated news, not just social content, but from high-quality publishers, could go and consume that content.” Facebook had previously floated the idea of splitting user feeds into two sections – A dedicated personal feed for posts from family and friends and “Explore Feed” which would show content from brands and publishers. It later abandoned this plan. The news tab could be a way for Facebook to combat criticism over its policy with regards to ads that allow the inclusion of false information.
