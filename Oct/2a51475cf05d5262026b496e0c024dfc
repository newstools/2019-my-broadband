Future Android devices will be required to have some form of device usage measurement application in addition to parental control features, 9to5Google reports. This is according to the latest Google Mobile Services (GMS) agreement, which stipulates requirements for manufacturers (OEMs) of Android-based devices that feature Google services. According to the new agreement, all devices that either launch with or are upgraded to Google’s Android 10 or Android Pie operating systems after 3 September 2019 are required to be loaded with a “digital wellbeing” app. The app must measure usage habits such as a user’s total screen time, along with the number of unlocks and notifications the device receives, and display this information to the user in a dashboard interface. In addition, the app will need to provide the ability to set usage limits and schedule times for the device to enter Do Not Disturb mode. Although smartphone manufacturers can install their own app for this purpose, Google’s existing Digital Wellbeing app already offers all of the aforementioned required functionality. Should device makers prefer, they can simply load Google’s app onto their devices. Google’s Digital Wellbeing app was previously only available on Pixel phones and devices running Android One.
