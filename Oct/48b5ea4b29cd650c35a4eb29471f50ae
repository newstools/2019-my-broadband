Huawei has shipped over 200 million smartphones in 2019, and has achieved this 64 days faster than it did last year. According to Huawei, this achievement is in large part due to the launch of various new smartphones – including the P30 and Mate 30 ranges. “Huawei’s relentless focus on cutting-edge technology and innovative ID design, with its complete commitment to consumers worldwide, has reinforced their trust and commitment as more consumers continue to support Huawei,” the company said. To celebrate the milestone, Huawei has announced that it will be launching a commemorative edition of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro 5G, which will be available in the Chinese market from 1 November. This smartphone will ship with 8GB RAM, 512GB storage, and will use vegan leather in its construction. Huawei has achieved this record sales rate this year despite the restrictions imposed upon it by the US government. These restrictions have left the company unable to offer Google Services on its new smartphones, and have also affected its relationship with various US-based hardware providers. “We are not under any illusions, and these circumstances have forced us to adapt,” said Huawei South Africa CTO Akhram Mohamed at the MyBroadband Conference 2019. “We have launched Harmony OS and we are moving onto Huawei Mobile Services to account for the lack of Google Services.”
