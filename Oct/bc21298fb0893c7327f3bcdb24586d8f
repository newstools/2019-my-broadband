Eskom load-shedding is back, and stage 2 will be implemented today. The load-shedding will be implemented from 09:00 and run until 23:00 this evening. Eskom said that the load-shedding was necessary due to a shortage of capacity. A media statement with more details will be issued, added Eskom. South Africans are advised to check their respective load-shedding schedules.  After Eskom managed to prevent load-shedding for several months, it was reported in August that an acceleration in economic growth in South Africa could trigger new power cuts. This was because Eskom’s “fragile generation system” was said to be unable to respond to increased demand for electricity. This followed a statement from Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan in April that Eskom had a plan to fight load-shedding in the country. Gordhan said Eskom’s goal was to ensure there would be no load-shedding from 3 April – but that there was a lot of hard work ahead for the company. Energy expert Chris Yelland said Eskom’s load-shedding announcement follows major generation capacity supply shortages. These supply shortages, Yelland said, are caused by unplanned generation breakdowns which spiked yesterday and have continued today. He said one reactor at the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station is down, while four units at other power stations are down due to boiler tube leaks. He added that there is a problem at the Grootvlei Power Station and that the conveyor belt transporting coal from Grootegeluk to Matimba is also down.
