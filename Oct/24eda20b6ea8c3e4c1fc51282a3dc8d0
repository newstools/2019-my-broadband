MultiChoice has reached an agreement with A+E Networks Africa to extend the current contract to air History and Lifetime channels on the DStv platform. DStv announced on 1 October that it would cut three popular channels from its network at the end of October – History, Crime + Investigation, and Lifetime. These three channels have been available to DStv Premium and DStv Compact Plus subscribers for years. The contract term for these channels, which are all provided by the broadcasting company A+E Networks Africa, was set to end on 1 November 2019. MultiChoice’s senior manager for corporate communications, Benedict Maaga told MyBroadband at the time that the decision formed part of a plan to refresh the DStv line-up. MultiChoice said the extension of the contract with A+E Networks will ensure that DStv viewers continue to enjoy History and Lifetime. The company said Lifetime programmes which will be shown include the premiere of Heartbreak Island, new seasons of Married at First Sight, and Surviving Jeffery Epstein. History fans can look forward to new seasons of Curse of Oak Island and Forged in Fire, Watergate, and Rise of the Superbombs. The good news for DStv Compact customers is that they will get access to Lifetime from 1 November 2019. There is, however, some bad news: Crime+Investigation will still be cancelled tomorrow.
