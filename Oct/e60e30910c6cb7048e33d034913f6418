Cell C has launched WIN24Summer, its summer campaign which features new prizes and deals on various handsets. “At the heart of this campaign is social inclusion, bringing together people by sharing how each of the millions of South Africans live and share during the summer,” said Cell C Executive Head of Marketing Hazel Chimhandamba. To do this, customers can upload video clips of their summer experiences to the WIN24Summer portal, where they will be curated into daily showreels. During the period of the campaign, Cell C customers will also receive instant prizes in the form of data, airtime, and SMSs when purchasing qualifying bundles. These include daily, 5-day or 30-day data bundles, as well as any of Cell C’s all-in-one bundles and prepaid or postpaid voice bundles. Rewards will be selected at random and do not correspond with the bundle purchased. These purchases also qualify customers for entry to daily, weekly, and monthly prize draws for big-ticket items. Daily draws offer the potential to win items such as smartphone, shopping, and cash vouchers, while weekly draws include bigger cash prizes and laptop vouchers. Cell C will also be collaborating with radio stations to give away cash prizes for listeners to donate to a charity. We have listed five of the best 24-month MediaPlay 1.5GB smartphone contracts that form part of the WIN24Summer campaign below.
