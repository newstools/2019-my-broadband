Motorola has sent out invitations which hint at the launch of its rebooted Razr device on 13 November at an event in Los Angeles. According to CNET, Motorola said the Los Angeles event will feature the “highly anticipated unveiling of a reinvented icon”. Included in the invitation is a GIF that appears to show the hinge of an old Motorola Razr “melting” away to reveal a new device underneath. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323970 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-RAZR-430x430.png" alt="" width="430" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-RAZR-430x430.png 430w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-RAZR-400x400.png 400w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-RAZR-768x768.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-RAZR.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 85vw, 430px" /> The invite also featured the tagline “You’re going to flip”. The device is expected to be Motorola’s new foldable phone, which is rumoured to replicate the flip-phone design of one of the company’s most recognizable devices, the original Motorola Razr. In recent months, several rumours and leaks about the device’s design and launch have surfaced. These included renders of the device which show a full touchscreen that can be folded vertically down the middle to convert into a compact, square shape. A report by XDA Developers also claimed that the new Razr will sport a Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 processor, 4GB or 6GB RAM, a 2,730mAh battery, and either 64GB or 128GB of storage. CNET also learned that Motorola had previously planned for a mid-year release date. If the event turns out to be the launch of Motorola’s own foldable smartphone entry, the device will be set to compete with the likes of the recently released Samsung Galaxy Fold and Huawei’s yet-to-be-released Mate X.
