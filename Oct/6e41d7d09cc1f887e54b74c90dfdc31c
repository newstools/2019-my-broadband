Focussing on three key elements helped make Supersonic one of the best ISPs in South Africa. This is according to Supersonic CEO Calvin Collet, who was speaking at the 2019 MyBroadband Conference. Supersonic, a division of MTN, launched after Smart Village was rebranded and absorbed into it. As pointed out after the launch of Superonic, Smart Village did not have a good reputation with clients. Collet led an initiative to turn this around, and the three elements they focussed on were: This focus on customer service has seen Collet personally call customers to apologise for issues they experienced on the network. It also led the company to standardise prices across the networks it runs on. Collet previously told MyBroadband that many cheap fibre deals flooding the South African market are unsustainable in the long run. Collet stressed the importance of customer service and network stability in fibre packages from local ISPs, stating that Supersonicâ€™s offering does not aim to be the cheapest. Instead, he said they aim to offer the best value to consumers in the form of network health and service. At the 2019 conference, Collet said there are over 100 ISPs in South Africa, and consumers must investigate an ISP package before signing up for one. He added that certain ISPs will ask clients to pay for installation and a router up front, too, where Supersonic does not do this. ISPs with few customers will also not make enough money to survive, and this can result in problems for their users. Collet also spoke about 5G and fibre connectivity in South Africa, and how there is a need for services to reach more of the population. While 5G and fibre can achieve high speeds, there is a need for a connectivity solution which is available at an affordable price point and has a wide geographic reach. This could be achieved with wireless technologies, he concluded.
