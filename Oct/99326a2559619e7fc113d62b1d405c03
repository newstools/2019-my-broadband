The stock market has the potential to make you lots of money, but getting involved in it can be a complicated endeavour. There is a lot of confusing processes and red tape involved in trading stocks online, which is a reason that many people decide not to invest their money this way. However, there is a tool that can help you to make trades quickly and simply with an online trading account – Mexem. Mexem is an online trading platform designed to make investing simple. It allows you to avoid the need to work through brokers and saves you substantial amounts of money because of this. Mexem operates as an introducing broker for the US’ largest trading platform, Interactive Brokers, which provides it with phenomenal features and opportunities for its users. This includes the ability to trade online on over 120 markets worldwide, in 23 different currencies – all at highly competitive prices – with your Mexem trading account. Mexem doesn’t charge clients anything for their trading account over and above the standard Interactive Brokers costs – meaning that you save even more money. Mexem’s fee structure competes favourably when compared to the other popular South African online trading platforms. This is because these other platforms lack the global scale of Interactive Brokers – which Mexem is able to leverage. This is evident in the table below. Every cent you save contributes to your overall investing profit, and it is clear from the above data that Mexem’s trading accounts are the best option if you’re looking for affordable online trading rates.
