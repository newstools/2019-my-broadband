WhatsApp is working on a new Group Privacy Blacklist feature designed to prevent unwanted group invitations, WABetaInfo reports. This feature forms part of a number of new group privacy settings which have already been partially rolled out to WhatsApp users in India, according to the report. The Group Privacy Blacklist function replaces a previous option which prevented all users from automatically inviting you to groups with a new setting named “My contacts except…”. This option allows you to blacklist certain contacts from inviting you to groups while still allowing group invites from trusted sources. In cases where group invites are blocked, users will be prompted to send you a private invitation through the individual chat, giving you the chance to join the group. Changing to this setting still allows users to block all invitations by using the option to select all of their contacts. WhatsApp has reportedly begun implementing this feature in beta versions of its Android and iOS applications, although there is currently no release date for the new functionality. The company announced earlier this year that it would implement new group privacy settings, stating that this functionality would roll out soon.
