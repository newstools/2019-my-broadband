Apple suppliers have reportedly started to manufacture the company’s first 5G iPhones, due for release in 2020. This is according to unnamed sources cited by the Nikkei Asian Review. The report claims that Apple plans to launch three iPhones with 5G capabilities next year, with a sales target of 80 million units. Apple normally ships around the same number of new iPhones every year. Its “aggressive sales target” is part of a plan to overtake Huawei as the world’s second-largest smartphone manufacturer, the report stated. Apple’s delay in delivering a 5G iPhone is partly affected by a drawn-out legal battle with chip manufacturer Qualcomm. The two companies reached a settlement in April, however, after Intel failed to provide Apple with a satisfactory production timeline to manufacture 5G chips for the iPhone. Previous reports stated that Apple would use Qualcomm’s X55 modems for these devices. The modem is expected to be paired with a new Apple chipset. According to Nikkei, the new processor will likely be the A14 Bionic, which will be the first Apple chipset that is built on a 5nm manufacturing process. Nikkei added that the introduction of 5G devices in the iPhone lineup could speed up the global rollout of 5G infrastructure, especially in markets outside of China. Apple’s biggest competitors, Samsung and Huawei, have already unveiled their own 5G-capable smartphones.
