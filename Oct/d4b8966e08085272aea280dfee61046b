TCL has teased a prototype foldable device that employs two hinges which divide a large display into three separate parts. The concept device is made by TCL, a Chinese manufacturer which is better known for its affordable TV range. TCL also manufactures and sells phones under the Alcatel brand. CNET illustrated the folding capabilities of the device in a hands-on video. Current foldable phones like the Samsung Galaxy Fold use a hinge that folds the display inward like a book, while the Huawei Mate X’s butterfly mechanism bends the display outwards to wrap around the back of the phone. TCL’s concept phone features two hinges that allow for the folding of the device in two places on its expanded 10-inch display. In its halfway-folded position, the phone is shaped like a Z when viewed from the side, and when completely folded, the device looks like three stacked smartphones. Other components include four rear cameras, one front camera, and a USB-C port. The device does not have a name, price tag or production window. Images of the prototype device along with CNET’s hands-on video are posted below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324791 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_1-640x329.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="329" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_1-640x329.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_1-600x309.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_1-768x395.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_1.jpg 923w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324805 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_3-1-e1571991153922-640x342.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="342" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_3-1-e1571991153922.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_3-1-e1571991153922-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324797 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_4-640x401.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="401" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_4-640x401.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_4-600x376.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_4-768x482.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_4-1200x752.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_4.jpg 1343w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324799" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_5-628x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="438" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_5-628x430.jpg 628w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_5-584x400.jpg 584w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_5-768x526.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_5-1200x821.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCL-phone_5.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324801" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCl-phone_6.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="449" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCl-phone_6.jpg 878w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCl-phone_6-570x400.jpg 570w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCl-phone_6-768x539.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TCl-phone_6-613x430.jpg 613w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
