Porsche is intensifying its battle against Tesla Inc. with the unveiling of a 105,607-euro ($116,590) version of the electric Taycan that’s pitched at a similar price point to the top-line version of the U.S. company’s Model S. The entry-level Taycan 4S is available for pre-orders now and will enter showrooms in early January, the Volkswagen AG brand said Monday. The model follows Porsche’s much-hyped Taycan launch last month at Niagara Falls, a Chinese wind farm and a solar site in Germany which underscored the brand’s central role in VW’s shift to electric cars. The two models showcased at the launch, the Turbo S and Turbo, are priced at $185,000 and $150,900. The cheaper 4S version sets itself apart with red-painted brake calipers, a front apron with new geometry and black side sills and rear diffusers, Porsche said. VW has a lot riding on success of the Taycan after sister brand Audi’s launch of a challenger to Tesla’s Model X sport utility vehicle, the e-Tron, was marred by delays and a recall. Despite its considerable engineering prowess, Volkswagen has struggled to slow Tesla’s march, which has moved into new segments with the lower-priced Model 3. The Porsche 4S can drive 407 kilometers (253 miles) on a single charge, rising to 463 kilometers with a bigger battery. That’s still less than the 102,700-euro Model S Performance with a range of 610 kilometers. There’s more to come at Porsche. The carmaker said last month it also plans to start sales at the end of next year of a Taycan Gran Turismo derivative. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323236" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-2-640x374.jpg" alt="Taycan 4S 2" width="640" height="374" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-2-640x374.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-2-600x351.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-2-768x449.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-2.jpg 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323234" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4s-3-640x368.jpg" alt="Taycan 4s 3" width="640" height="368" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4s-3-640x368.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4s-3-600x345.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4s-3-768x441.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4s-3.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323232" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-4-640x373.jpg" alt="Taycan 4S 4" width="640" height="373" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-4-640x373.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-4-600x350.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-4-768x448.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-4.jpg 1087w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-323230" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-5-640x369.jpg" alt="Taycan 4S 5" width="640" height="369" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-5-640x369.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-5-600x346.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-5-768x443.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Taycan-4S-5.jpg 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
