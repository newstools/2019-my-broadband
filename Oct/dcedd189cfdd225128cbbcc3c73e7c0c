MyBroadband, the premier ICT news website in South Africa with 2 million monthly readers, covers many events each year. Our in-house editorial and partner content teams attend and report on events held by the likes of Samsung, Huawei, Vodacom, MTN, and more. We also cover our own events, including the industry-leading MyBroadband Conference. With so many ICT events taking place in South Africa each year, however, we are selective on what is reported on. Our editorial team attends and reports on events which provide breaking and insightful ICT news. For example, when MTN held an event to demonstrate its 5G technologies, our editorial team covered the event in great detail. Our partner content team then covers the events of our commercial partners, reporting on the most important aspects of the event. This includes taking videos and photos, conducting interviews, and writing and publishing the articles on MyBroadband. MyBroadband has a range event packages on offer which will shine a spotlight on your events. Whether you would like pre-event coverage to drive interest and registrations or post-event reporting on what took place, our partner content team is here to deliver great results. We also offer a range of event promotion tools: such as sending event registration emails to our databases and holding competitions in which we give away tickets to your event.
