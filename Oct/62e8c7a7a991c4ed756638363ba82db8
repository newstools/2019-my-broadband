Cool Ideas has announced that it will reduce the prices of its Openserve fibre prices. Cool Ideas offers uncapped, unshaped packages across multiple fibre networks with no fair usage policies enforced on its network. This means customers can use as much data as they want each month, without any fear of their Internet connection being throttled or shaped based on their downloads. Cool Ideas has made big changes to its Openserve pricing, dropping the price of its fibre packages substantially across the board. The price of its 200Mbps Openserve offering has been cut from R2,409 to R1,499 – a price drop of almost R1,000. Cool Ideas’ 100Mbps package has also seen a big price cut, with the monthly cost dropping from R1,499 to R1,199. Every Openserve fibre package has been reduced except for the 10Mbps/5Mbps package, which is still priced at R499 per month. Below is the old and new pricing for Cool Ideas’ Openserve fibre packages. The company’s new fibre prices will be effective from 2 November 2019.
