Instagram has added a new security feature that lists all official emails the company has sent to users to help them identify phishing scams, reports Engadget. “Bad actors are getting better at imitating emails from Instagram, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to distinguish between a genuine email and a fake one,” said an Instagram spokesperson. The feature will list all security-related emails the company has sent over the past two weeks, such as requests to change your password. A second tab will list all non-security emails sent by Instagram, such as feature announcements and direct messages from other users. Instagram’s move comes after several high-profile controversies surrounding user privacy have impacted popular social media platforms. Most notably, Facebook was recently forced to pay a R70-billion fine to resolve a US investigation into years of privacy violations, including the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter also asked all users to change their passwords last year, after it was found that every user’s password had been transformed from a hashed code into plain text. While protecting against phishing scams is a strong move towards increased user security by Instagram, most large data breaches are not due to user error, but problems or vulnerabilities at the companies themselves.
