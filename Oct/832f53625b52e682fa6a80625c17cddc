INX-ZA has signed an agreement with Dark Fibre Africa (DFA) to upgrade the multisite Johannesburg Internet Exchange (JINX). DFA will donate a high-speed fibre connection between the Isando and Parklands Internet exchange point location. “This will enable JINX to make use of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technologies, radically enhancing the exchange’s backbone capacity,” said INX-ZA. “The agreement between DFA and JINX will see WDM technologies essentially transforming a single link into almost unlimited network capacity. This means JINX can now easily and independently manage its own capacity between these sites.” INX-ZA said the upgrade would “thrust JINX into the next technology bracket”. “We look forward to other leading fibre providers also donating connectivity solutions to promote further enhancements at South Africa’s INXs.” South Africa is one of the few countries on the continent with two Internet exchange providers. The two major exchanges in South Africa are INX-ZA and NAPAfrica, which provide neutral places for service providers and other network operators to exchange traffic. These exchange points facilitate the interconnection of networks, allowing local Internet users to benefit from faster connections and better access to online services.
