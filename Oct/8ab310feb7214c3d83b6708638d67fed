A large distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) attack is affecting numerous South African fibre and ADSL subscribers from Afrihost, Axxess, and Webafrica. Axxess alerted its subscribers at 16:56 on Sunday that they might experience intermittent connectivity issues. Webafrica informed its subscribers at 18:16 on Sunday that it is experiencing a network outage which affects subscribers in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Afrihost also told its users on Sunday that its network is experiencing intermittent connectivity issues. MyBroadband received information that Liquid Telecom is one of the targets of the DDoS attack which started at around 15:39 on Sunday. Liquid Telecom could not be immediately reached to confirm whether its network is the main target of the attack. Afrihost CEO Gian Visser explained that the DDoS attacks are destined to several networks advertised by Liquid Telecom and are not specific to its own network. Visser added that while the attacks continued, the severity and impact of the attack have decreased. He explained that locally-hosted content like Netflix, Gmail, and YouTube should be working without problems. “Internationally hosted game servers and other international resources will remain an issue until the attacks go away or are well mitigated,” he said. The Downdetector stats show the downtime for Axxess, Afrihost and Webafrica which started on Sunday Afternoon. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324961" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Downdetector.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="650" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Downdetector.jpg 1138w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Downdetector-394x400.jpg 394w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Downdetector-768x780.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Downdetector-423x430.jpg 423w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
