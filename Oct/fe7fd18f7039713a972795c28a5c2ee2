Openserve CEO Alphonzo Samuels will retire on 31 March 2020 after 36 years of service at Telkom. During his time at Telkom, Samuels served in many roles, including broadband officer, managing executive for network infrastructure provisioning, and group chief technology officer. In an email to staff, Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko said Samuels has a tremendous impact on the evolution of Telkom’s network. He said Samuels joined Telkom at a time when microwave systems were cutting-edge and when the company was only just commissioning digital electronic exchanges. “The fact that Alphonzo started as a Trainee Technician and retires as the Chief Executive Officer of Openserve illustrates the kind of man he is,” said Maseko. “A man who perseveres, who embodies the value of hard, honest work and who gives his all. A man with a vision, and with the skills and drive to turn that vision into reality.” He also credited Samuels for providing guidance and insight during the functional separation of Telkom’s wholesale and networks divisions, which led to the establishment of Openserve. “He was the foundation on which the process was built and is the driving force behind our ongoing thrust to modernise the network,” Maseko said.
