With this kind of budget, you could get a top-of-the-range liquid-cooled RTX 2080 Ti with enough left over for more hardware upgrades. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-322824" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gigabyte-GeForce-GTX-1080-Ti.jpg" alt="Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2080 Ti" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gigabyte-GeForce-GTX-1080-Ti.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gigabyte-GeForce-GTX-1080-Ti-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gigabyte-GeForce-GTX-1080-Ti-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If you covet the iPhone 11 Pro Max for its big screen, you might prefer a 55-inch TV with impressive HDR features. Samsung’s QLED TVs are considered some of the best in the market and are competitively priced – even when compared to the latest iPhone. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-322828" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Samsung-55-inch-UHD-QLED-TV.jpg" alt="Samsung 55-inch UHD QLED TV" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Samsung-55-inch-UHD-QLED-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Samsung-55-inch-UHD-QLED-TV-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Samsung-55-inch-UHD-QLED-TV-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Why buy one flagship smartphone when you could get two? Instead of buying a single iPhone 11 Pro Max 512GB, you could buy two of Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 flagships, which each boast an in-screen fingerprint sensor, 128GB of internal storage, and advanced camera systems. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312019" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/s10-plus-1.png" alt="s10 plus" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/s10-plus-1.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/s10-plus-1-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/s10-plus-1-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If you’re an Apple fan, you could forgo the most expensive iPhone on the market for a new laptop. For the price of the iPhone 11 Pro Max 512GB, you could buy a new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-322830" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-inch-MacBook-Pro-with-Touch-Bar.jpg" alt="13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-inch-MacBook-Pro-with-Touch-Bar.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-inch-MacBook-Pro-with-Touch-Bar-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-inch-MacBook-Pro-with-Touch-Bar-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The price of Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max 512GB is equivalent to the budget of many people’s vacations. For example, instead of spending over R32,000 on this new handset, you could buy yourself a seven-night holiday to Mauritius and have money to spare. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-238818" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mauritius-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mauritius-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mauritius-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mauritius-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> You could buy two years of uncapped 100Mbps fibre through Afrihost instead of the iPhone 11 Pro Max 512GB. This includes line rental and is calculated based on Openserve packages. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-219456" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FibreImage_White.jpg" alt="Fibre" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FibreImage_White.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FibreImage_White-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FibreImage_White-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
