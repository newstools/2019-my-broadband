MTN has launched its Summer YouTube Contract Promotion, which offers new and existing customers 20GB of YouTube data and up to 30GB of Anytime once-off data when they sign up or upgrade to selected price plans. Anytime data can be used at any time of the day, and is valid for the first 30 days of the customer’s contract. YouTube data will only be depleted when the customer is watching YouTube videos, and will not work for standard web browsing or other media platforms. The promotion runs until 31 January 2020, and the amount of free Anytime data varies depending on the contract selected. “Throughout all the years, MTN has remained committed to offering our customers solutions that are relevant and that resonate with them, and this promotion is no different,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN South Africa. The data allocation for each contract package is outlined below.
