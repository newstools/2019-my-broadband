Standard Bank has stated that the outage on its banking services yesterday was not due to a hack of their systems. This comes after an article from Business Day reported that South African banks were under cyber attack. Standard Bank said on Thursday that a number of its online services were offline due to technical issues. “You may be finding it difficult to log on to Internet Banking at the moment. We are working to sort this out. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused and will keep you updated,” the bank said. Opening the mobile app provided users with a message that said, “The app is offline. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” As an alternative, the Standard Bank said customers may use its cellphone banking service via its USSD menu by dialling *120*2345#. When asked whether they had been the target of an attack, Standard Bank provided MyBroadband with the following statement: “Standard Bank wishes to clarify that there was no link between an interruption in its banking services yesterday and an external cyber event that reportedly impacted the provision of public e-services.”
