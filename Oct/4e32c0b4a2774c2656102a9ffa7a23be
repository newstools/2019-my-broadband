Limpopo provincial government IT officer Lesetja Mathiba has been suspended by premier Stan Mathabatha after declaring that he would testify about possible corruption in the province. According to a report by City Press, the suspected corruption is related to a R585-million broadband connection tender, which Mathiba said was awarded in contravention with the State Information Technology Agency (Sita) Act. This meant the project amounted to irregular expenditure, he said. The tender is being pushed through to Limpopo Connexion, a company which Mathiba said has no other purpose than to act as a vehicle for corruption. Mathiba also lodged a complaint with the SA Human Rights Commission claiming that Limpopo director-general Nape Nchabeleng attacked him during meetings where he disagreed with the tender process. “During question time, I was the first to raise a hand as I wanted to pose a question,” Mathiba said. “But the director-general said I was not allowed to participate and should not raise my hand because I was the one who went to the media making allegations of fraud and corruption relating to the project.” “He was, in a way, intimidating, harassing, and victimising me.” Sita has reportedly written to the Limpopo provincial government and ordered it not to use the Limpopo Connexion vehicle, as this would violate the Sita Act. The provincial government of Limpopo did not provide comment to City Press regarding the corruption allegations.
