OfferZen has published its State of South Africa’s Software Developer Nation 2019 report, which shows that developers want to leave the country in droves. “In order to shed light on what we see playing out in our marketplace every day, we sent out a survey to the developer community,” OfferZen CEO Malan Joubert said. “Thousands of developers responded, and shared with us what it’s like to work in South Africa, what programming languages and tech stacks they most enjoy working with, and what’s most important to them when looking for a job.” According to OfferZen’s report, 86% of developers are open to the possibility of moving abroad, and one in five South African developers are actively looking for opportunities outside of South Africa’s borders. Europe is the most popular destination for those seeking jobs overseas, while the UK and the US are second and third respectively. Australasia is fourth, while just over 20% of developers are interested in moving to Asia. The top reason for wanting to work overseas is personal safety, while other popular reasons include growth opportunities and improved salaries. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-325205" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/overseas-job-hunters-640x380.png" alt="overseas job hunters" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/overseas-job-hunters.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/overseas-job-hunters-600x356.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Fintech is the most lucrative field for intermediate developers in South Africa, with employees earning an average of R39,291 per month. The worst fields for intermediate developers are web development or design, where employees take home an average monthly salary of R28,211. Data and analytics is the most profitable field for junior developers, while senior developers earn the most when working on cloud-based solutions – earning an average of R67,276 per month. JavaScript is the most popular programming language in South Africa, with over 65% of developers using it as one of their primary languages. C# is the second most popular language in both Cape Town and Gauteng. Python is the third most popular language in Cape Town, and Java holds this spot in Gauteng. TypeScript and PHP are the only other languages that are used by at least 10% of South African developers. South African developers prefer working with JavaScript and Python – the latter of which has become hugely popular over the last year. The data also shows that Go and Ruby are the most lucrative programming languages in South Africa, and PHP is the language that earns developers the lowest salaries. Node.js and Angular are the most commonly used frameworks by South African developers, followed by .NET Core, React, and ASP. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-325199" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/popular-languages-sa-640x376.png" alt="popular languages sa" width="640" height="376" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/popular-languages-sa-640x376.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/popular-languages-sa-600x353.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/popular-languages-sa-768x452.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/popular-languages-sa.png 988w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Salaries and bonuses are the biggest priority for developers searching for a job. After remuneration, the next most popular considerations are flexible work hours and remote working opportunities. Cape Town developers are particularly committed to having flexible hours included in their contract, whereas Gauteng developers place a larger emphasis on a budget for attending conferences. Developers looking for a new job also place a larger priority on company culture and professional growth opportunities than on the technology being used by the company. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-325201" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reasons-for-taking-jobs-developers-640x376.png" alt="Reasons for taking jobs - developers" width="640" height="376" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reasons-for-taking-jobs-developers-640x376.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reasons-for-taking-jobs-developers-600x352.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reasons-for-taking-jobs-developers-768x451.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Reasons-for-taking-jobs-developers.png 1051w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The full report can be found on OfferZen’s website.
