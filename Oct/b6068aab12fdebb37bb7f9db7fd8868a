Earlier this year, WeWork began rolling out its shared office spaces in Johannesburg and Cape Town. The company now has three active office spaces across South Africa – two in Johannesburg and one in Cape Town. The Johannesburg offices are in Sandton and Rosebank, while the Cape Town office is located in the city centre. WeWork’s Cape Town office can host over 590 members, and the new Sandton office in Johannesburg can house over 1,800. The Link WeWork office in Rosebank can accommodate up to 2,000 workers. WeWork has listed detailed rates for its South African office spaces on its website, with prices varying depending on location and membership plan. The company offers three workspace pricing plans at each of its South African locations: “Private Offices”, “Dedicated Desks”, and “Hot Desks”. The features offered by each of these plans are detailed below: The pricing for WeWork’s private offices depends on the number of seats required, with the company offering anywhere between 1 and 50 seats per private space. Larger teams can also be accommodated, and they would need to contact WeWork directly for private office space pricing. Some WeWork locations also offer Labs Desks designed for education and mentorship, although there is no pricing listed for this option. Per-month pricing for each of WeWork’s shared office spaces in Johannesburg and Cape Town is detailed below.
