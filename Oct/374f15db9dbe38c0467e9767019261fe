Speaking at the 2019 MyBroadband Conference, Q-KON CEO Dawie De Wet detailed the capabilities of the company’s new satellite broadband offering. Q-KON’s broadband offering is named Twoobii, and is a satellite broadband solution which works over an end-to-end connection. After undergoing a “DStv-like” installation, customers can take advantage of a broadband connection which boasts 10Mbps download speeds and 3Mbps upload speeds. The service is uncapped, with customers paying around R50 per GB. De Wet said this offering shatters the perception of satellite broadband as slow and expensive. The big advantage to the Twoobii installation is its coverage, delivering broadband to areas where no other broadband is available. Through a partnership with Intelsat, Q-KON’s Twoobii product offers users voice, data, and Internet services anywhere they are in South Africa. “The thing about satellite Internet is availability – it can be installed anywhere in South Africa.” De Wet said that Twoobii is positioned as a business product, specifically aimed at off-grid businesses in locations without other broadband coverage. Applications for this broadband use case include point-of-sale communications, rural connectivity, and crucial backhaul infrastructure. Users can find out more about Q-KON’s satellite broadband offering on the official Twoobii website.
