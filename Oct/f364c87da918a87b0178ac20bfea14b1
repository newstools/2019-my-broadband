It can also deliver up to 10 hours of Bluetooth calling, 24 hours of music playback, or 30 hours of GPS usage. It also offers an improved user experience, including an all-in-one 3D borderless glass display and an improved sports mode. This sports mode is compatible with 15 activities, including running, walking, climbing, cycling, swimming, and triathlon. The watch records data while you exercise and analyses this information to provide you with advice once your exercise routine has been completed. The TruSleep 2.0 feature also uses data analysis to rate your quality of sleep, analyse your sleep problems, and provide sleep improvement suggestions.
