Google unveiled its new PixelBook Go Chromebook at its Made By Google event, offering powerful hardware in a portable form factor. The device runs Chrome OS and features a 13.3-inch touchscreen with an impressive battery. The PixelBook Go will offer up to 12 hours of battery life and fast charging support which can deliver two hours of battery in 20 minutes of charging. “Each design element on Pixelbook Go was built for people who are always on the go,” Google said. “The first thing you’ll notice is the sleek matte finish. That finely painted magnesium casing keeps Pixelbook Go as light as possible while still feeling solid.” The Pixelbook Go has the same high-performance components as other Google Pixelbook devices, the company added. “It starts up in seconds and stays fast with automatic updates, so you can count on speedy performance over time,” Google said. “And with built-in security on Chrome OS, Pixelbook Go is both fast and secure.” The Pixelbook Go has a price tag of $649 and will be available in two colours – Just Black and Not Pink. The Pixelbook Go is available for pre-order in the United States today. The company has not yet published specifications for the device. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-323396" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixelbook-Go-2-1.jpg" alt="Pixelbook Go 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixelbook-Go-2-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixelbook-Go-2-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixelbook-Go-2-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-323400" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixelbook-Go-3-1.jpg" alt="Pixelbook Go 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixelbook-Go-3-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixelbook-Go-3-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixelbook-Go-3-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
