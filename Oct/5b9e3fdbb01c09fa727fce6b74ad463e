Vodacom and the South African Police Service have officially launched the MySAPS app – a platform which aims to streamline crime reporting. MyBroadband first reported on the planned launch of the app in September. At the time, a source suggested that the release would take place on 11 October. In a statement issued today, Vodacom announced the official launch of the app. “This will further strengthen the relationship between the police and communities – creating better policing for the future,” said Public Enterprises Managing Executive Rudi Matjokana. SAPS National Commissioner General Khehla Sitole said MySAPS will give South Africans easier access to police services and information. “Our end goal through the introduction of this app, is to create a safer society for all South Africans.” Users of the MySAPS app will have access to several features, including: Users must first register and create a profile to access the platform. After creating a profile, a directory of police stations and nearby social service facilities will be provided. When using the tip-off the facility, an option will be given to report the crime anonymously. The user must then identify the incident type and supply details of the event. After this, suspect’s details will need to be supplied to assist SAPS in creating a profile of the suspected perpetrator. Finally, the person that reports the crime will get a reference number to add more information regarding the crime or to follow up on the police’s progress. It is important to note that victims of crime will still be required to register a case at a police station for the purposes of investigation and insurance claims. The MySAPS app is available for smartphones from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store in South Africa. Feature phones users can also use the USSD string *134*10111# to access the SAPS Crime Tip Off line.
