Many Internet service providers (ISPs) have cut their Openserve uncapped fibre-to-the-home prices in recent weeks. Afrihost kicked off the latest round of price cuts when it launched its Pure Fibre products in July, offering subscribers uncapped, unshaped, unthrottled, and unmetered products. Other ISPs, including Axxess and MWEB, were quick to respond with their own price cuts and fibre promotions. The latest service provider to cut its uncapped fibre prices was Cool Ideas, which announced large Openserve reductions this week. The price of its 200Mbps Openserve offering has been cut from R2,409 to R1,499 – a price drop of almost R1,000. Cool Ideas’ 100Mbps package has also seen a big price cut, with the monthly cost dropping from R1,499 to R1,199. The table below provides an overview of the latest uncapped fibre-to-the-home prices from prominent ISPs. It should be noted that these prices are only for packages offered on Openserve’s fibre network.
