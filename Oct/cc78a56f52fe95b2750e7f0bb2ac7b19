Vox has announced new capped and uncapped satellite internet plans that will be made available through its partnership with Avanti Communications. Subscribers to the capped satellite data plans have the option to add an uncapped voice channel to their package. “Being able to offer our customers options such as high throughput uncapped data and uncapped voice plans, at this price point, is a game changer for telecommunications in South Africa,” said Jacques Visser, head of wireless at Vox. “Gone are the days when satellite internet was seen as a slow, expensive service.” Monthly plans include the following: Avanti Communications uses four Ka-band HYLAS satellites to provides satellite connectivity to 118 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Ka-band satellite has been growing around the world; it’s quick and easy to install for end users, and provides them with much higher throughputs as compared to other satellite technologies,” said Visser. “Our partnership with Avanti helps us expand our existing Ka-band satellite services portfolio, bring new data and voice offerings to the South African market, and give our customers more choice.”
