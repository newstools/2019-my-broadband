The African Network Information Centre (AFRINIC) has announced that its next public policy meeting will be held in Angola on 2–6 December 2019. While the AFRINIC public policy meeting has become an annual event, this is the 31st such meeting in the 15 years that AFRINIC has existed. AFRINIC 31 is being organised in collaboration with the Ministry of Telecommunication and Information Technology and the Association of Internet Service Providers in Angola. AFRINIC said that its public policy meeting will be a platform for technocrats and business to discuss policies, trends, resources, and challenges in growing the Internet for sustainable development in Africa and the Indian Ocean Region. It will consist of keynote speeches, policy discussions, seminars, workshops, tutorials, and other forums for sharing ICT knowledge within the African region. Last year’s AFRINIC public policy meeting was held in Hammamet, Tunisia, and was attended by over 254 delegates from 43 countries around the world. Registration for AFRINIC 31 is open through the meeting website.
