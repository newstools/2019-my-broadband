AMD has unveiled two new entry-level graphics cards, the Radeon RX 5500 for desktops and the RX 5500M for laptops. The GPUs are set to compete with Nvidia’s budget graphics chips, including the GeForce GTX 1060 and GTX 1650. The cards are made with the same 7nm Navi architecture that is used in the more powerful Radeon RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT. The desktop unit boasts clock speeds from 1.67GHz to 1.85GHz and 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, while the mobile version will run between 1.44GHz and 1.64GHz with 4GB of memory. Both cards feature 22 compute units and a maximum memory bandwidth of 224 GB/s. The GPUs are intended for optimal 1080p gaming, and AMD promises significant performance improvements over Nvidia’s offering in the mid-price range. According to AMD’s benchmarks, the RX 5500 delivers 92 FPS in Gears 5 and 60 FPS in Ghost Recon Breakpoint with both titles on medium settings in DirectX 11. When compared to the GTX 1650, AMD states its RX 5500M will perform about 30% faster in gaming. The MSI Alpha 15 will be the first laptop to include a Radeon RX 5500M, paired with a quad-core Ryzen 7 3750H processor and a Full HD Display with a 144Hz panel. The laptop will be priced at $999. AMD said its Radeon RX 5500 graphics card will launch in Q4 2019.
