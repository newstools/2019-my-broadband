Intel’s Tiger Lake-U processors could support LPDDR5 memory, according to a leak that surfaced on Twitter. Tom’s Hardware first reported about the information based on a tweet from a reputable hardware leaker, who picked up a Eurasian Economic Commission (ECC) notification from 18 October that shows Tiger Lake-U chips which feature LPDDR5 support. Tiger Lake is expected to replace Intel’s existing Ice Lake architecture, and will also be built using a 10nm manufacturing process. The Intel Tiger Lake U-series is expected to launch in 2020 and is intended for use in mobile devices that could benefit from better battery life, such as slim, portable laptops. LPDDR4 memory boasts a maximum data transfer rate of 3,200Mbps, while the improved LPDDR4X allows for 4,266Mbps. LPDDR5 pushes this rate up to 6,400Mbps. The new standard will reportedly also reduce power consumption by 30% and add a “deep sleep” power-saving mode, which is ideal for the mobile devices that will feature these chips. The introduction of LPDDR5 compatibility in Tiger Lake-U chips next year seems probable, given that several leading memory manufacturers, such as Samsung and SK Hynix, plan to introduce DDR5 RAM by the end of 2019.
