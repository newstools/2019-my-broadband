Riot Games, the creator of popular MOBA League of Legends, announced that it will launch a trio of new games. The titles include a first-person shooter, a card game, and a new MOBA. “We want to sincerely thank all of our players for the last 10 years of League of Legends,” said Riot in a statement. “None of this would have been possible without your support, feedback, and passion.” Project A is Riot Games’ attempt at a first-person shooter. The character-based tactical shooter appears to be similar to games such as Overwatch and Team Fortress 2. Popular League of Legends game mode Teamfight Tactics will also get its second set, called Rise of the Elements, which includes various new origins, classes, and champions. Riot Games will also be porting Teamfight Tactics to mobile and will add support for crossplay between mobile and PC. League of Legends: Wild Rift is a new 5v5 MOBA that is based on the original game’s characters. It will be designed from the ground up and will be available on iOS, Android, and consoles. Finally, Legends of Runeterra is a strategy card game based within the lore of the League of Legends universe – much like Blizzard’s Hearthstone. Players who want to try out Legends of Runeterra can pre-register for the beta, which will give them the chance to participate in a preview of the game from 15 – 20 October.
