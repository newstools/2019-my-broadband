GoPro has officially unveiled its Hero 8 Black action camera. The Hero 8 Black features the same 12MP camera and GP1 processor as its predecessor but boasts several updates to the chassis. Reviews from Engadget and TechRadar commend the Hero 8’s camera’s enhanced image stabilization through Hypersmooth 2.0. The feature is now also available in all shooting resolutions and frame rates on the camera. Thanks to enhanced wind noise cancellation, the quality of sound recorded on the front-facing microphone, now located directly below the lens, is also improved. The mounting frame has been replaced by built-in foldable “fingers” that can be used to link the device onto any current GoPro mounts. An improved operating system adds useful shortcuts to options like shooting presets and HDR to the interface. Along with the announcement of the Hero 8, GoPro also revealed its new 360-degree action video camera – the GoPro Max. GoPro’s second 360-degree variant is a more compact device that shares many of the Hero 8 Black’s features. The Max sports 180-degree lenses on the front and rear of the device, which can be used for taking extreme wide-angle shots that are cropped into a flat format. It also has an array of six microphones for all-round spherical audio capturing. Both the GoPro Hero 8 Black and GoPro Max will ship from 15 October and are available for pre-order at Takealot and Outdoorphoto. On Takealot, the Hero 8 Black is priced at R7,989, while the Max costs R9,989. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
