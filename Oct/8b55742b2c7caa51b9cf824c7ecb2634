EA has teased on social media that it will be bringing its games back to Valveâ€™s Steam store. The gaming giant published a tweet which featured a video of an EA-branded cup of coffee with steam rising from it. This follows rumours which began last week that EA was planning on bringing its games back to the Steam storefront. Twitter user RobotBrush posted an image which showed a test application for running EA games on Steam. The implication of the image in this tweet is that players would be able to purchase EA games on Steam and store them in their Steam library, but they would still need to open the Origin Launcher to play these games.  EA games have not been available on Steam since the company launched its Origin storefront in 2011. EA currently runs a subscription service called Origin Access which allows users to pay a monthly fee to access an extensive library of EA games. This means it would be unlikely that EA would make all of its games available on Steam. Instead, it is expected that the company would bring classic titles such as the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series to the platform.
