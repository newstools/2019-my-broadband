Elon Musk has pledged to donate $1 million to a global crowdfunding project that aims to plant millions of trees. The #TeamTrees campaign was launched by YouTuber Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson last week. The initiative targets raising $20 million for the Arbor Day Foundation to plant 20 million native trees in various forests of “high need” at a cost of $1 each. At the time of writing, the campaign has raised just less than $8 million. In a tweet yesterday night, Musk asked YouTube tech reviewer Marques Brownlee what trees would be planted and where. After Brownlee had replied with the details of the donation, Musk tweeted, “Ok, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees.” Musk’s pledge can be seen in the leaderboard on the #TeamTrees website, along with the caption “For Treebeard”. He also changed his Twitter handle to “@Treelon” shortly after the tweet. Another well-known tech figure which has apparently also contributed to the effort is Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Dorsey’s name also appears on the leaderboard with a donation of $150,000. Music producer Alan Walker has also donated $100,000. YouTube also tweeted it will match the next $1-million contribution to the campaign.
