MSI is renowned worldwide for its impressive gaming laptops, and it has delivered that same level of quality and design in its new Creator lineup of high-end notebooks. The Creator Series of MSI laptops comprises slim, professional notebooks which offer unprecedented performance – rivaling even the company’s gaming laptops in hardware capabilities. MSI provided us with the top-of-the-range P75 Creator to try out, and its sleek and lightweight design paired with powerful hardware delivered something extremely impressive. The P75 Creator is like a powerful desktop PC disguised as a professional notebook, offering enough performance to cope with demanding workloads, such as on-the-go video editing or 3D rendering. Hardcore gamers would also find the laptop capable of delivering the goods, and its high-resolution 17.3-inch display offers a great viewing experience. The MSI P75 Creator packs high-grade components into its surprisingly slim and light chassis. It includes a 9th-generation Intel Core i9 processor along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 graphics card with Max-Q design. The model we were provided also boasted 32GB of RAM and 1TB of solid-state storage, rounding out the specifications to make an extremely powerful machine. The ultra-thin bezel around the 17.3-inch Full HD display means that the laptop is surprisingly small compared to other 17-inch devices, but it still manages to deliver up to eight hours of battery life. Below are the full specifications of the slim but powerful MSI P75 Creator S9F. The advantage of a laptop compared to a traditional desktop setup has always been portability, which is traditionally gained at the expense of performance. This is fine for most professional applications, but content creators, video editors, designers, and even gamers are often limited by the hardware inside their laptops, causing them to turn to desktops instead. Those who do choose a laptop with powerful hardware would be hard-pressed to find one that didn’t weigh a ton or take up their entire desk. This is where the MSI P75 Creator comes in – with its powerful CPU and graphics and ultra-slim design, it offers the best of both worlds. The P75 Creator can serve as everything from a portable video editing station for the content creator to the standard notebook and primary gaming rig for the professional that likes to fire up Counter-Strike after work. The laptop delivered insane performance in every game we ran, and it never overheated or throttled due to temperature. Its battery life is excellent, and the understated, professional design makes it ideal for almost any scenario where both style and power are demanded. The MSI P75 Creator is available from Evetech and other local retailers from R35,999. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323586" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-1-573x430.jpg" alt="MSI P75 Creator 1" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-1-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-1-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323590" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-3-573x430.jpg" alt="MSI P75 Creator 3" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-3-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-3-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323588" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-2-573x430.jpg" alt="MSI P75 Creator 2" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-2-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-2-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MSI-P75-Creator-2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
