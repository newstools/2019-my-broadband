PC gaming is still king in South Africa, according to the results of the MyBroadband 2019 Gaming Survey. 1,787 readers took part in the survey, the majority of whom worked in the ICT sector or were tech-savvy individuals. When it comes to gaming, PC was by far the most popular platform. The PlayStation 4 then came in a distant second place. Respondents were also asked to rate the best brands across a range of PC gaming categories â€“ including graphics cards, monitors, and laptops. The results of the survey are detailed in the graphs below. Please note that brands with a low response were omitted from the graphs.
