Stellenbosch University (SU) is making use of exciting mobile payments technology on its campuses, offering safe and convenient solutions to its community. University fees, as well as prepaid services like data and print credits, can now be paid within the SnapScan app. People can even use the funds in their SnapScan Wallets to make these payments. “SnapScan was founded in Stellenbosch by university alumni, and as a proud Matie, I’m extremely excited to partner with the university and help them create better payment experiences”, said Tobias de Villiers, SnapScan’s Head of Business Development. Stellenbosch University has been added to the Bills section of the SnapScan app, which means that app users can now pay university fees via SnapScan. In order to make a payment, the fee payer simply needs to enter the relevant student number to pay the outstanding amount on the student account. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324222 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-640x415.png" alt="" width="640" height="415" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-640x415.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-600x389.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-768x498.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-1200x778.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Stellenbosch University has also been added to the Prepaid section of the SnapScan app (amongst prepaid electricity, airtime, and data). Students can now purchase the university’s data and print credits through the app. This will save students time as these services used to be purchased at the University’s cashiers in the central administration building. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-324220 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-640x415.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="415" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-640x415.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-600x389.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-768x498.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2-1200x778.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “Many of SnapScan’s first merchants were from the Stellenbosch area. These new in-app expansions for SU give us the opportunity to solve new problems and contribute more to the whole Stellenbosch community, fostering an ecosystem grounded in innovative tech.” added de Villiers. These features are currently only available for Stellenbosch University, but it is hoped that other universities will be interested in incorporating SnapScan’s convenient payments solutions into their campuses.
