MultiChoice CEO Mark Rayner has apologised to DStv subscribers who were affected by recent billing problems. This follows a large number of complaints from DStv subscribers who said they were overcharged in recent months. MultiChoice spokesperson Benedict Maaga told MyBroadband that the launch of additional services over the years has created complexity in the company’s billing. This complexity, he said, makes it more difficult for DStv customers to understand their billing. “There were different payment dates for different services, which led to inconsistent information on how much to pay and a need to pay multiple times a month,” he said. “Following feedback from our customers, we have now consolidated all services on a customer’s account resulting in easier billing”. The billing changes means there is now “only one amount to pay and only one payment required each month”. Speaking to Cape Talk, Rayner said they should have warned DStv subscribers about the planned billing changes before implementing them. According to MultiChoice, the hardware portion of the Price Lock plan instalment was previously billed in arrears. It is now billed in advance, which means that DStv Price Lock subscribers have seen an increase in their recent DStv bills. “We tried to consolidate our complicated account structure. In doing that, we made a couple of slip-ups,” said Rayner. He added that they can’t be excused for not making this clear to customers upfront. “We certainly don’t believe we did a good job of communicating. We do apologise for that,” he said.
