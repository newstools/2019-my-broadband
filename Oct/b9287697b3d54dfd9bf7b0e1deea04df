Nvidia has revealed Super variants of its entry-level gaming cards, the GeForce GTX 1650 and GTX 1660. The company first introduced the Super branding for improved editions of its high-performance RTX line-up. The GeForce GTX 16 Series cards are intended for mainstream players looking for solid performance in 1080p gaming. The GTX 1650 Super boasts more cores, higher base and boost clock speeds, and faster GDDR6 VRAM than the previous version. The GTX 1660 Super keeps the same core count and clock speeds as the base model but adds higher-bandwidth GDDR6 memory. With the upgrade to GDDR6, memory speeds are increased from 8Gbps to 12Gbps in the GTX 1650 Super and 14Gbps in the GTX 1660 Super. The prices for the cards are expected to be similar to the standard versions. Nvidia said the GTX 1660 Super will offer around double the performance of a GTX 1060 and a 50% performance increase over the GTX 1660. Early benchmark tests of the GTX 1660 Super by TechRadar showed a performance increase of 15% in 3DMark Fire Strike compared to the GTX 1660. The GTX 1660 Super is available now, while the GTX 1650 Super will be released in the third week of November. The table below compares the hardware of the standard versions of the GTX 1650 and 1660 with new Super versions.
