Load-shedding has well and truly returned, which means hours of powerless evenings without access to your TV, computer, and even your lights. Showmax subscribers and DStv Now users have an alternative to sitting in the dark, twiddling their thumbs. Showmax subscribers can download movies and series onto their mobile devices by using the Showmax app. Once you begin watching a downloaded title on the Showmax app, you have 48 hours to consume the content and can download multiple titles to watch offline. Once you’ve watched a movie or series episode, delete it to free up space for new downloads. You don’t need an active Internet connection to watch downloaded content – even if load-shedding affects mobile network coverage, you’ll be able to watch.  The DStv Now app works almost identically to the Showmax app. The difference between the two is that while Showmax has movies, full seasons and kids shows, DStv Now users also have access to sports highlights.
