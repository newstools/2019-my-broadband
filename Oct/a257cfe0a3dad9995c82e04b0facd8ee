Standard Bank has stated that a number of its online services are currently offline due to technical issues. In a statement released on its official Twitter page on Thursday 24 October, the bank said that customers may find it difficult to log into the Internet banking platform. Standard Bank also said that its mobile banking app was experiencing issues. As an alternative, the bank said customers may use its cellphone banking service via its USSD menu on *120*2345#. At the time of writing, both Standard Bank’s mobile app and Internet banking portal were not accessible via smartphone or web browser. When attempting to access the online banking portal, Standard Bank customers are presented with the following message: “You may be finding it difficult to log on to Internet Banking at the moment. We are working to sort this out. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused and will keep you updated.” Opening the mobile app returns a message which states, “The app is offline. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” The bank did not provide an expected time for when the services would be brought back online, but it said clients would be advised as soon as the issue was rectified.
