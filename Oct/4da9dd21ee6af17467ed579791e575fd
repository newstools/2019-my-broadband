AFRINIC has confirmed that Eddy Mabano Kayihura will be the next CEO of the organisation. He will join AFRINIC on 4 November 2019. Alan Barrett resigned as AFRINIC CEO earlier this year, and the organisation has been searching for a replacement since May. AFRINIC is the Regional Internet Registry for the African region. It is responsible for managing the assignment of Internet Protocol addresses in the region. The official announcement from AFRINIC comes after a former board member, Robert Ford Nkusi, posted on Twitter that Kayihura had been selected as the next CEO. Chairman of the AFRINIC board, Christian Bope, said that Kayihura brings a wealth of experience to the position. Kayihura has served as a chief executive officer, a chief information technology officer, a network engineer, and a software developer in the IT and telecommunications industry. Before his appointment as AFRINIC’s CEO, Kayihura was working as a telecommunications, financial technology, and IT infrastructure consultant in Rwanda. Between December 2016 and December 2018, he was the CIO at the Bank of Kigali, the largest Bank in Rwanda. He has also been the executive chairman of the Rwanda Internet Community and Technology Alliance (RICTA). He worked as the CEO of Broadband Systems Corporation in Rwanda between September 2013 and December 2016. Kayihura has also contributed to the growth of the Internet exchange point ecosystem in Africa as a workshop facilitator on the AXIS project under ISOC and the African Union. Kayihura holds an MBA in International Business from Oklahoma Christian University, a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the National University of Rwanda, and several other professional qualifications. “Mr Kayihura joins us at a time when AFRINIC is beefing up its operational capacity, and it is our view that he has the required experience and expertise to drive these changes, as well as ensuring the organisation continues to be a major catalyst for both Internet development and use in Africa,” Bope said. “It is my great pleasure to welcome Mr. Kayihura to the AFRINIC family.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-325195" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eddy-Mabano-Kayihura-AFRINIC.jpg" alt="Image showing Eddy Mabano Kayihura with Bit.ly link to their press release" width="620" height="411" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eddy-Mabano-Kayihura-AFRINIC.jpg 620w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eddy-Mabano-Kayihura-AFRINIC-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
