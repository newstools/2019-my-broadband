1MORE is the latest headphone brand to launch in South Africa, and offers incredible quality at a surprisingly affordable price. This leading global audio company was founded with a clear goal in mind: to provide music lovers – regardless of age or financial status – the ability to hear music as it was meant to be heard. 1MORE provided us with review units of three of their headphones that are now available in South Africa: These units impressed us with their awesome sound, impressive features, and great build quality. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-322012" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1more-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-639x430.png" alt="1more true wireless in-ear headphones" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1more-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1more-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1more-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1more-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The 1More True Wireless In-Ear Headphones are light and comfortable, and provide high-quality sound. These headphones use Qualcomm’s aptX audio technology, and are AAC compatible – ensuring that they sound absolutely fantastic. I used the earphones for a gym session after work, and was pleased at how they sat snugly in my ears during exercise and general moving-around. They come in four colour variants – green, pink, black and gold – and won the 2019 IF Design Award, which is not surprising given their stylish metallic aesthetic and how comfortable they were to use. The controls on the earphones were also pleasant to use, and consisted of a button on each unit which allowed me to pause a song when needed. Looking at the more practical elements of the earphones: The 1More earphones were a good companion during my test at the gym and provided a great experience when it came to comfort and sound performance. The True Wireless In-Ear Headphones are available at a recommended retail price of R1,799. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-322014" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-triple-driver-BT-in-ear-headphones-639x430.png" alt="1MORE triple driver BT in-ear headphones" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-triple-driver-BT-in-ear-headphones-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-triple-driver-BT-in-ear-headphones-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-triple-driver-BT-in-ear-headphones-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-triple-driver-BT-in-ear-headphones.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The 1MORE Triple Driver BT in-ear headphones deliver some of the best sound I’ve heard in wireless Bluetooth headphones. The levels were nicely balanced, and the adjustable earbuds were comfortable, making it a pleasure to listen through these headphones for hours on end. These in-ear headphones use a triple driver design to improve the quality of the listening experience, and use the HI-RES LDAC Bluetooth 4.2 Codec – ensuring optimal wireless sound transmission. These headphones are the perfect companion to a modern smartphone without any 3.5mm audio jack thanks to their great sound and accessible call and media playback controls on the neckband. Connectivity is also extremely reliable, allowing me to stray impressively far from my smartphone without experiencing any interruptions or stuttering. Battery life is also great at seven hours, and the charge time from zero to full is only around an hour. These headphones also support quick-charging, with a 10-minute charge capable of offering you up to three hours of playback. They also have a surprisingly effective built-in MEMS microphone that uses ENC technology to offer incredibly clear communications for a set of in-ear wireless headphones. These headphones have a recommended retail price of R2,299, which is already great value for such impressive headphones. However, as part of a huge launch promo for 1MORE in South Africa, these earphones will be available for just R699.95 at select Musica stores during the month of October (only while limited stocks last) – which is an absolute bargain. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-322016" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-Spearhead-VRX-Gaming-Headphones.png" alt="1MORE Spearhead VRX Gaming Headphones" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-Spearhead-VRX-Gaming-Headphones.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-Spearhead-VRX-Gaming-Headphones-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1MORE-Spearhead-VRX-Gaming-Headphones-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Spearhead VRX gaming headphones provide an excellent 7.1 surround sound audio experience for immersive gaming and multimedia consumption. These headphones use the Waves Nx 3D Audio technology, which is an incredibly impressive piece of software. It simulates how the brain processes acoustic space and the physical properties of the sound source in relation to the position of the user’s head. This allows it to offer rich and authentic 3D listening, as the audio shifts according to the movement of your head – placing you at the centre of an immersive VR experience. When gaming, the headphones perform particularly well. Locating opponents by their footsteps and other noisy movements was made easy thanks to the pinpoint directional sound offered by these headphones. The dynamic range in surround sound also offered accurate identification of the distances and the direction of action in first-person shooters like Apex Legends and CS:GO. The audio experience provided by these headphones was tuned by Grammy award winning sound engineer Luca Bignardi, ensuring that they satisfy even the most trained ears in the world. Communication with teammates while gaming is crystal clear thanks to the Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC) capability of the microphone, which was of great relief to teammates who could hear my every call. The build quality is solid because the headphones are made of stainless steel, and these headphones also have a fingerprint resistant surface with a matte finish to ensure that they always look at their best. The headset is also covered in LED lights which make for a great gamer aesthetic. These LED lights offer 16 million colours, ensuring that users have access to full customisation. They are present on the microphone, earcups, and on two 1MORE logos on either side of the headset. The Spearhead VRX can be worn comfortably for many hours at a time. One of the reasons for this is that the headband automatically adjusts to the size of your head, eliminating the need for any manual changes and fastening mechanisms that may break from wear and tear. These headphones also sport 360-degree rotating ear cushions that ensure that your headphones fit your head perfectly. The box comes with a Type A-Micro USB cable, and one 3.5 mm audio jack cable, as well as a carry bag for the headphones. The audio jack cable can be used for general music playback, but it can also be used with game consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. While this use case excludes certain software-specific features, console gamers will still get great gaming audio out of these headphones. Shop for 1MORE headphones and earphones on Takealot here.
