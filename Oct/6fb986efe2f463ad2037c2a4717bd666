Opera has launched the latest version of its browser, Opera 64, which it claims offers users page loading speeds that are 76% faster than before. The company said that these speed improvements are due to the efficiency of its privacy features, which include a new tracker blocker and an improved ad-blocker. According to Opera, the tracker blocker alone speeds up web browsing by almost 20%. Opera said that the tracker blocker relies on the EasyPrivacy Tracking Protection List, and once it is turned on, it works similarly to Opera’s native ad-blocker. “We consider ad blocker and tracker blocker to be basic privacy features, which can be kept on at all times,” said Opera. “But that’s not all you get from Opera: our browser also has plenty of extended privacy features which come in handy when you feel the need to increase the privacy of your browsing even further.” Opera 64 also brings with it a series of other new features, although most of these are relatively minor, and some are already available in other browsers. These include a new tool that makes taking screenshots easier, support for saving a website as a PDF file, as well as a meme creation tool. Learn more about Opera 64 below.
