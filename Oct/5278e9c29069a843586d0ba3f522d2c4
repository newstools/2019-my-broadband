Load-shedding is back! Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere anytime soon. For the past few years we’ve all been at the mercy of Eskom’s incompetence. Load-shedding not only costs our economy billions of rand a day but has frustrated us all as a nation. There’s nothing worse than being halfway through the finale of your favourite series or, worse yet, finishing an assignment or project to suddenly find yourself disconnected and in the dark because of load-shedding. While we may not be able to keep your lights on, we can keep you online when load shedding strikes. If you order fibre with RSAWEB today, you will get a free mini uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

All you need to do is ensure that your router, ONT, and UPS are properly connected and plugged in. This is just one of the many ways that RSAWEB makes life better for their customers.
