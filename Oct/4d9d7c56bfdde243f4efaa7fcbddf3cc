Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that all Apple MacBooks will be updated to replace the current butterfly keyboard with an improved scissor keyboard before the middle of 2020. It had already been suggested by Kuo that Apple was planning on using a more traditional scissor mechanism to replace the butterfly keyboard in its upcoming 16-inch MacBook Pro. Kuo had also predicted that other Apple laptops would ship with the new keyboard in 2020. Now, however, he predicts that the entire range will drop the butterfly technology in a matter of months. According to Kuo, the new scissor mechanism is likely to be slightly thicker than the current butterfly model, but he believes that most users will not be able to tell the difference. Kuo also reiterated his belief that Apple would launch a new iPhone SE smartphone. He predicts that this smartphone will use Apple’s latest A13 Bionic mobile chipset within the older iPhone 8 body. If Kuo is correct, the iPhone SE 2 will be available in the first quarter of 2020 and will serve as an affordable alternative to Apple’s recently-launched iPhone 11 range. “We estimate iPhone SE2 shipments in 2020 will reach 30–40 [million] units,” said Kuo.
