Apple has launched the latest version of its mobile operating system – iOS 13.2. This version of Apple’s mobile operating system will include Apple’s Deep Fusion camera technology for the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max smartphones. Deep Fusion is image processing software that uses the A13 Bionic Neural Engine to take multiple images at different exposure levels, analyse each of these photos, and use the highest-quality elements of each of these images to create the best possible photograph. iOS 13.2 will also allow iPhone 11 range users to change the video resolution they record in from within the Camera app. Apple made a number of changes to Siri, including adding support for the new Announce Messages command – which allows Siri to read your incoming messages to you through your AirPods. This feature is also supported by Apple’s new AirPods Pro. Apple also included new Siri privacy settings which allow users to decide whether they will allow Apple to store their Siri interactions. Several smaller additions have been implemented in iOS 13.2, including: Apple has launched versions for iPadOS 13.2 and tvOS 13.2, as well as iOS 12.4.3 – which is available for older devices such as the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, and iPad Air.
