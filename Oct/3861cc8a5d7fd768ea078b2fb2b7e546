Microsoft unveiled its latest attempt at a smartphone, the Surface Duo, on Wednesday. The Surface Duo will use a dual-screen model that is reminiscent of Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, with two 5.6-inch displays expanding into a 8.3-inch display. Microsoft believes that this, combined with the implementation of a stylus, will allow users to be more productive. The Surface Duo will run on Android, as opposed to Microsoft’s previous smartphones, which infamously used Microsoft’s own mobile operating system. By using Android, the Surface Duo will be able to run popular apps from the Google Play Store such as Facebook and WhatsApp. “This product brings together the absolute best of Microsoft, and we’re partnering with Google to bring the absolute best of Android in one product,” said Microsoft Product Chief Panos Panay. “This is industry pushing technology.” Microsoft said the Surface Duo will launch in 2020. No specifications have been released for the Surface Duo. The Surface Duo enters a foldable smartphone market that has been plagued by delayed launch dates and faulty devices. Samsung’s Galaxy Fold had to delay its launch after its review units were found to be have major display issues – a failure which Samsung’s CEO DJ Koh has since labelled “embarrassing.” The Galaxy Fold finally launched in select markets on 6 September. Huawei has also delayed the launch of its Mate X foldable smartphone to ensure that it did not suffer the same fate as Samsung. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
