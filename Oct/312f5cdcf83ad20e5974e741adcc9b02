Numerous SEACOM customers are complaining about regular outages, which included downtime of several hours last week. One SEACOM customer, who asked not to be named, told MyBroadband that “there is not a week where SEACOM’s services do not go down”. The company’s CTO said they have many branches across South Africa, and that all these branches have connectivity and VoIP services from SEACOM. “We had numerous discussions about the poor quality of service from SEACOM and were assured that the problems were a thing of the past,” he said. However, last week the company experienced its worst outage yet, with SEACOM going down for 6 hours. “This is having severe and detrimental operational and financial implications on our company as our customers cannot place orders with us, and neither can we deliver to them,” he said. Many SEACOM clients took to social media to complain about the recent downtime, highlighting the damage it did to their businesses. “I have a call center running on your network and we are experiencing very bad connection for the last two days. This is crippling my business,” one client said. Another client said that many SEACOM customers are considering cancelling their contracts and have requested a refund related to the downtime. “I had to use mobile data to create a hotspot to attend a crucial teleconferencing call during the outage. My biggest issue was the lack of communication over the outage,” he said. SEACOM responded to questions from MyBroadband, saying it experienced technical difficulties on Tuesday 1 October. These technical difficulties affected South African customers on selected parts of the data network. “SEACOM’s services were fully restored at 20:30 of the same day. We regret the inconvenience caused by this outage and are taking measures to mitigate future outages,” SEACOM said. The company did not comment on regular outages on its network or complaints from its customers about poor communication about these outages.
