Vodacom has launched a new payment plan for Samsung Galaxy smartphones which allows customers to pay for the device over 12 months with no interest. “Many people in the country cannot afford high-tech smartphones or don’t want to commit to a contract,” said Vodacom Financial Services Chief Officer, Mariam Cassim. “This is why we are excited to announce our new prepaid device offer which empowers customers to manage their spend, without being tied to a contract, giving them flexibility and full control, while at the same time enabling them to purchase a smartphone by paying it back over a few months.” Customers will be required to pay a 10% deposit, and Vodacom will deliver the smartphone within two to three working days. Vodacom said that it will communicate available offers directly to eligible customers based on their current spend and the length of time they have been on the Vodacom network. The deal will originally be available for a selection of Samsung devices including the Galaxy J4 and A2 Core, and pricing will range from R799 to R2,999 depending on the device purchased. Vodacom also said it expects to expand this offer to other devices over time. Vodacom’s consumer business unit chief officer Jorge Mendes recently told MyBroadband that the company was partnering with Samsung to offer a payment plan whereby Vodacom will lock users’ devices if they miss a payment. When locked, the smartphone’s screen will be almost entirely blacked out and a notification will appear instructing the owner to pay their outstanding instalments. The smartphone will still receive calls and notifications, but users will not be able to interact with the device in any other way. Mendes said that customers will receive sufficient warning before their devices are locked.
