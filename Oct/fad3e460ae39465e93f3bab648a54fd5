An illegal bank card market place has been exploited by white hat hackers to recover the details of over 26 million credit and debit cards, reported Brian Krebs of Krebs on Security. BriansClub, which untruthfully claims to be run by Krebs, is one of the largest underground marketplaces for stolen credit card details. The real Krebs was contacted by a source who shared a plain text file that included a database of cards that were either currently or previously for sale on BriansClub. “Multiple people who reviewed the database shared by my source confirmed that the same credit card records also could be found in a more redacted form simply by searching the BriansClub Web site with a valid, properly-funded account,” said Krebs. According to Krebs, the following number of card details were listed for sale on BriansClub since 2015: The total value of the cards on BriansClub is estimated to be about $414 million, based on the pricing provided on the BriansClub website. “Most of what’s on offer at BriansClub are ‘dumps’, strings of ones and zeros that — when encoded onto anything with a magnetic stripe the size of a credit card — can be used by thieves to purchase electronics, gift cards and other high-priced items at big box stores,” said Krebs. Krebs said the stolen data has been shared with various sources who are working with financial institutions to either monitor or reissue cards in the database.
