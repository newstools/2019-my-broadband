Google’s cloud game streaming service Stadia could offer a “faster and more responsive” gaming experience than local hardware in consoles and PCs, according to Stadia’s vice president of engineering. In an interview with Edge Magazine, Stadia’s Madj Bakar said that Google will employ several technologies to counter the effects of high latency in connection speeds. “Ultimately, we think in a year or two we’ll have games that are running faster and feel more responsive in the cloud than they do locally, ” said Bakar. According to TechRadar, these technologies include what Google terms “Negative Latency”, which refers to a large stream buffer that will improve the server’s frame rates. It also plans to implement an algorithm that predicts the buttons players will press to pre-empt processing of the required frames. Bakar said these methods could eventually give Stadia an edge over consoles and PCs, “regardless of how powerful the local machine is”. The service will require an internet connection with a minimum download speed of 25Mbps for 1080p or 30Mbps for 4K game streaming at 60fps. Google Stadia is scheduled for release next month, with analysts estimating a launch on 12 or 13 November. Confirmed titles include Destiny 2 and the PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2.
