Samsung is already planning the launch of its second foldable smartphone, ETNews reports. The Galaxy Fold 2 is reportedly set to launch in April 2020 and will have a vastly different style to the current Samsung foldable smartphone. Instead of folding outwards into a tablet-like device, the Galaxy Fold 2 will reportedly use a clamshell design to fold upwards – much like traditional flip phones. Samsung is also rumoured to be replacing the transparent plastic protective layer on the current Fold with scratch-resistant ultra-thin glass (UTG) on the new Fold 2. The plastic layer caused significant issues for Samsung upon the initial release of the Galaxy Fold, as some users thought it was a removable screen cover and damaged their displays by trying to peel it off. ETNews also claimed that the Galaxy Fold 2 would be cheaper than the current Galaxy smartphone, with the expected price being about $1,500 – $300 cheaper than the current version. This may mean that the expensive UTG solution could be scrapped in order to bring the price of the device down. SamMobile predicts that one way that Samsung may be able to enable this cost is by lowering the amount of storage space from 512GB to 256GB. The current Galaxy Fold has launched in South Africa for R43,999, but is only available in extremely limited quantities.
