Adobe recommends that Photoshop and Lightroom Classic users refrain from updating their macOS operating system to Catalina. According to Adobe, there are a series of compatibility issues affecting the use of its editing software on the latest version of macOS. “Photoshop 20.0.6 and later versions work with macOS 10.15 (Catalina) but have these known compatibility issues,” said Adobe in a statement. “You may want to remain on your current version of macOS until these issues have been resolved.” One compatibility issue involves file naming options not working correctly when users choose to “Save As”. This includes the fact that changing the file format does not change the extension of the file in the name field. Another issue relating to “Save As” is that selecting the “As a copy” option does not append “copy” to the file name. Adobe also said that customers who upgrade to macOS Catalina and then try to download and install plugins may encounter failures. “This happens with plug-ins that are not notarized that are downloaded from the web or installed by other methods such as drag & drop,” said Adobe. Other issues that Photoshop users could face on macOS Catalina include: Adobe also highlighted that legacy and perpetual versions of Photoshop are not designed or tested to work on macOS Catalina, nor are they supported in any way. “Adobe does not recommend that customers using old versions of Photoshop upgrade to macOS Catalina,” said Adobe.
