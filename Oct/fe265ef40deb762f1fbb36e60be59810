Eskom says it has been hit by a major setback after losing additional capacity at its Medupi power station. In a statement on Friday 18 October, the power utility said that late last night it lost capacity at Medupi 3, 4 and 5 due to coal and ash handling issues. This is in addition to the conveyor belt that failed on Saturday (12 October) at the power station, it said. “This means that the power system has deteriorated further creating an additional shortage of about generation capacity of 1,500MW. As a result, we will regrettably maintain Stage 2 load shedding for the greater part of today. “We understand the negative impact this will have on our customers, in particular, our matriculants who are writing exams this morning. “In order to lessen the disruption on exams, will be implementing Stage 1 load shedding from 09:00 until 12:00 and thereafter revert to stage 2 load shedding until 23:00.” Eskom apologised to its customers and South Africans for the short notification. “We will keep South Africans informed about the status and our recovery efforts throughout this period,” it said.
