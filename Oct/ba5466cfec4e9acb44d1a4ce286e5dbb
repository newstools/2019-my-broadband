Huawei has announced that its Watch GT 2 will be available in South Africa from 17 October, and will cost R4,999. According to Huawei, the Watch GT 2 offers users “unrivalled” battery life. The company said the Watch GT 2 can run continuously for up to two weeks with its intelligent heart rate monitor and call notification functions running, and can deliver up to 10 hours of Bluetooth calling, 24 hours of music playback, or 30 hours of GPS usage. The Watch GT 2 also offers an improved user experience, including an all-in-one 3D borderless glass display and an improved sports mode. This sports mode is compatible with 15 activities, including running, walking, climbing, cycling, swimming, and triathlon. The watch records data while you exercise and analyses this information to provide you with advice once your exercise routine has been completed. The TruSleep 2.0 feature also uses data analysis to rate your quality of sleep, analyse your sleep problems, and provide sleep improvement suggestions. Huawei is running a special for South African customers who pre-order the Huawei Watch GT 2. Users who order the Watch GT 2 before 17 October will receive a free pair of Huawei FreeLace earphones, which are valued at R2,499. This deal is only available on Huawei’s ecommerce store.
