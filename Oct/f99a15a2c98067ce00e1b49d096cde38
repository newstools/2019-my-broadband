Tests conducted by Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have concluded that Firefox is the most secure mainstream web browser. BSI leveraged a guideline document that it published last month to advise government agencies and private sector companies on which web browser they should use. The test included Firefox 68, Chrome 76, Internet Explorer 11, and Edge 44. However, it excludes smaller popular browsers such as Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi – all of which place a particularly high focus on security. The BSI guidelines used are an updated version of the agency’s initial 2017 browser security guide, and include a variety of improved security measures present in modern browsers, including: Firefox was the only browser that supported every requirement of the BSI’s guidelines. Areas where all of the other tested browsers failed include: Internet Explorer had a particularly poor showing in the tests, as it did not support a variety of new technologies, including SRI, CSP, and SOP, and did not include a built-in update mechanism.
