It is no surprise that the demands placed on an enterprise’s technology infrastructure are evolving faster than ever. As IT plays such a key role in enabling digital transformation, the IT function has morphed from purely supportive to serving as an enabler of change. In this context, it’s important to interrogate the way in which we conceive tech infrastructure. It is a misconception that IT costs end at the point of purchase. The initial purchase is merely a fraction of the total cost businesses should be considering. In fact, research shows that a PC’s base price typically represents less than 50% of its total cost of ownership (TCO), with deployment, support, maintenance, management and other costs accounting for the balance. Without assessing the TCO, it can be difficult to understand the real costs of IT equipment, in the long run. So let’s look at TCO, with a view to rethinking which elements of enterprise IT expenditure do and should warrant the highest levels of scrutiny. If we define TCO as the total cost of using and maintaining an IT investment over time, comprehensive TCO calculations should include a combination of direct costs (hardware, software, operations, support and administration) and indirect costs (end-user operations and downtime). IT spending, then, becomes a balancing act between hardware, software and services – with ecosystem management playing a large role in cost reduction. Other considerations should encompass deployment, support, maintenance, management, and a host of “soft” upsides relating to productivity, performance, and talent acquisition. Consider the experience of IBM, where the user choice programme, Mac@IBM, has enabled the deployment of 134,000 Macs, 90,000 iPhones and 40,000 iPads. Fletcher Previn, IBM’s CIO, says that for every Mac device IBM purchases for its workforce, the company saves $273 to $543 (depending on the model), versus the TCO of comparable PCs during a four-year lifespan. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-321994 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC-IBM-640x350.jpg" alt="MAC-IBM" width="640" height="350" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC-IBM-640x350.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC-IBM-600x328.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC-IBM-768x420.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MAC-IBM.jpg 864w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Yes, the upfront cost per Mac may be higher than a PC, but the former’s residual value is also higher, in addition to: While uniquely South African evidence relating to Mac vs PC TCO is in its relative infancy, this is not the case in the United States, where multiple studies demonstrate that a Mac’s TCO is 15-30% less (depending on user group) than a PC system. Furthermore, there’s an average saving in support spend per user of up to $205 over three years, with up to 80% fewer Mac support tickets. To get to “real costs”, it is important to ask the right questions about upfront costs, how platforms are supported, and what needs to be done to increase operating efficiency within your specific environment.
