Microsoft has started to invite players to test its Project xCloud game streaming platform. The service allows users to stream games from Microsoft’s cloud platform to their Android phones or tablets. Microsoft announced last month that it would be launching a free public preview of Project xCloud to users who signed up for the service. The titles that are currently available are Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Killer Instinct, and Sea of Thieves, with more games being added as the preview rolls on. Players will not need to own any of the games to play. For now, Project xCloud is only available to gamers in the US, UK, and South Korea. Corporate Vice President of Gaming Cloud at Microsoft, Kareem Choudhry, said that it is important to assess the service’s viability before officially launching the platform. “Public preview is a critical phase in our multi-year ambition to deliver game streaming globally at the scale and quality of experience that the gaming community deserves and expects,” said Choudhry. To participate in the trial, players require a device running Android 6.0 or higher, a compatible Xbox Wireless Controller with Bluetooth, a 5GHz Wi-Fi internet connection with a minimum download speed of 10Mbps, and the Xbox Game Streaming app. The current version will only allow players to stream games from Microsoft’s cloud platform and not from their own Xbox consoles.
