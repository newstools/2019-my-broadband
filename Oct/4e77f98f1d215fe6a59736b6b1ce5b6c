HBO has announced a 10-episode Game of Thrones prequel series titled House of the Dragon. The show will focus on the history of Daenerys’s family, the dragon-riding Targaryens, as written by George R.R. Martin in his 2019 novel Fire and Blood. The book is set 300 years before the events of Game of Thrones and details House Targaryen’s rise from Aegon’s Conquest to the civil war referred to as the Dance of Dragons. HBO programming president Casey Bloys made the announcement during the unveiling of HBO Max to investors yesterday. The video streaming service will be launched in May 2020. The spin-off is written by Ryan Condal, with Martin serving as executive producer. Miguel Sapochnik, who received praise for directing GOT episodes like “Hardhome” and “Battle of the Bastards”, will head up the show’s pilot. HBO has not revealed any casting or the airing date for the show. The announcement of House of the Dragon followed a number of reports which claimed HBO had decided against another Game of Thrones prequel which would have starred Naomi Watts. According to Entertainment Weekly, Martin’s existing lore serves as a solid backbone for the confirmed prequel.
