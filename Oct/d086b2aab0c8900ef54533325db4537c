Apple has unveiled the latest addition to its selection of earbuds – the AirPods Pro. The new devices feature active noise cancellation, which uses a combination of built-in microphones and software to provide users with an immersive sound experience. Each AirPod sports two microphones. An outward-facing microphone listens to background noise and counters this with an equivalent anti-noise, while another inward-facing microphone listens to the inside of the ear for any further noise disturbance. Apple says the noise cancellation will adapt the sound signal 200 times per second. For situations in which it may be best to be able to hear the surrounding environment, the AirPods Pro also include a Transparency mode. A new force sensor located on the stem of the AirPods allows the user to easily switch between active noise cancellation and Transparency mode, control music playback, and answer or end phone calls. The AirPods Pro also feature Adaptive EQ, which tunes the low- and mid-frequencies of music to best suit the listener’s ear. Apple says the AirPods Pro will provide 4.5 hours of continuous listening time. Using the wireless charging case will provide listeners with about 24 hours of battery life. The earbuds are sweat- and water-resistant and three different sizes of flexible silicone ear tips are included in the box, as well as a Lightning to USB-C cable for charging. The Airpods Pro will only be available in white and are set to launch in the United States on 30 October for $249. Local availability and pricing is not yet available.
