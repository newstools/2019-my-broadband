Vodacom has launched its new Vodacom Vibe 4G handset, which is priced at R299. The company has labelled the device as a “smart feature” phone, stating that it includes support for WhatsApp, Facebook, and other social media platforms. The device boasts a 2.8-inch display, long battery life, and a 2MP camera in addition to a physical keypad on the bottom half of the handset. Vodacom said the Vibe 4G has voice over Wi-Fi capabilities, which allows users to make calls using any Wi-Fi network. “In the past six years, smartphone penetration has doubled from 30% to 60% as customers migrate from 2G devices to 3G and 4G smartphones,” said Vodacom terminals managing executive Davide Tacchino. “To further drive this transition and help bridge the digital divide, we have now introduced South Africa’s first 4G feature phone for just R299, having launched the country’s first smart feature phone with a traditional keypad during the course of last year.” The device will be available for R299 at all Vodacom stores. It is also listed on Takealot for the same price. Customers who purchase this device will also receive 150MB of data every month for 12 months, which Vodacom said would allow them to explore the handset’s 4G capabilities.
