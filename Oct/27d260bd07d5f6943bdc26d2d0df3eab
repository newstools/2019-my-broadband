Eskom load-shedding is back, and stage 2 has been implemented today. The power utility introduced stage 2 load-shedding from 09:00 to 23:00 today due to a shortage of capacity. In a statement published on Twitter, Eskom said that the severe supply constraint was due to high levels of unplanned breakdowns. “The supply constraint is caused by, among others, five generating units that are unavailable due to boiler tube leaks,” it said. “In addition, a conveyor belt supplying Medupi power station with coal failed on Saturday (12 October) resulting in low volumes of coal being supplied to the power station thus limiting the generating capacity to approximately half the station output.” Eskom said that due to the shortage of generating capacity from coal-fired generation, its pumped storage and Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) generators have also been used extensively since Saturday, which has led to a decline in dam levels and diesel tank levels. “We unreservedly apologise to South Africans for the negative impact this may have on them and want to assure the nation that we continue to work tirelessly to ensure the security of energy supply,” Eskom said. To help reduce the load on its systems, the power utility advised South Africans to do the following: “Customers are advised to check their load-shedding schedules on the Eskom or municipal website,” the power utility said. “We will keep customers informed if there are any further changes to the power system.”
