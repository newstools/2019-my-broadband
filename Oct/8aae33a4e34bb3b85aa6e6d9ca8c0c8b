Apple has published the second developer beta version of iOS 13.2, which allows users to opt out of their audio data being shared with Apple. To opt in or opt out of having their audio analysed by Apple employees, users can navigate to Settings > Privacy > Analytics and Improvements, and then toggle “Improve Siri and Dictation.” The update will also allow users to delete their entire Siri and Dictation history. To do this, users must navigate to Settings > Siri and Search > Siri History, where they will be able to delete all relevant data. Apple has implemented these features following criticism the company received back in August regarding its use of contractors to manually review user audio data – potentially including sensitive or personal information. Apple has also updated its policy for reviewing user audio data. “If one of your Siri or Dictation interactions is selected for review, the request, as well as the response Siri provided, will be analyzed to determine accuracy and to generally improve Siri, Dictation, and natural language processing functionality in Apple products and services,” said Apple. “Depending on the context of your request, Apple employees may review Siri Data directly relevant to the request, in order to grade the effectiveness of Siri’s response.” Apple added that only its own employees, and not contractors, are able to access audio interactions with Siri and Dictation.
