MTN has published its trading update for the quarter ended 31 September 2019, showing a small drop in subscribers and slight service revenue growth in South Africa. MTN South Africa recorded service revenue growth of 0.4% over the period, stating that if an accrual basis of accounting was applied to Cell C roaming revenue, the company’s service revenue growth would be 3.5%. Overall subscribers fell by 0.3 million, and MTN South Africa ended the quarter with a customer base of 28.9 million. The company stated that the limited service revenue growth was impacted by ICASA regulations requiring lower out-of-bundle (OOB) data rates in addition to blocking OOB billing by default. “The trend in consumer prepaid revenue in the September 2019 quarter was encouraging, with the decline in the three months moderating to 2,7% YoY compared to a 5,1% YoY decline in the three months to June 2019,” MTN said. “We remain focused on returning to growth, supported by stabilising trends in voice and improvements in data.” With regards to Cell C’s outstanding payments for the roaming agreement between the two operators, MTN said it is continuing to work with the company on an expanded roaming agreement. “At June 2019, MTN had not recognised R393 million of unpaid revenue from its roaming agreement with Cell C and an impairment of R211 million had also been raised,” MTN said. “Since the end of June 2019 to date, Cell C has made payments amounting to nearly R750 million, in line with an agreed payment plan.” “We continue to work with Cell C on an expanded network deal and are seeing good progress to date,” the company added. MTN said it expects improved performance in South Africa next year, as the effects of the ICASA regulation on OOB usage moderate and the Cell C situation stabilises.
