Huawei is engaged in early talks with several US telecoms firms about licensing its network technology for 5G, according to a report by Reuters. Senior vice president and board director at Huawei Vincent Pang told Reuters that the interested parties are looking at both long-term deals and a once-off licensing fee. He declined to name the firms involved and said the talks are only weeks old. “There are some companies talking to us, but it would take a long journey to really finalize everything,” Pang said. “They have shown interest.” The US government has been at the forefront of a campaign to block Huawei from expanding its 5G infrastructure across the globe. In May, the US government blacklisted Huawei, banning American companies from trading hardware or software with the world’s biggest telecoms provider. It accused the Chinese government of using Huawei’s technology to spy on citizens and has warned its allies that this could undermine their national security. Huawei currently has no 5G footprint in the US, with service providers relying on 5G network infrastructure from Ericsson and Nokia. Huawei CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei said last month that the company is willing to provide “perpetual access” to its current 5G patents, licenses, blueprints, and code for a once-off fee. Ren posed this option as a means to ease the concerns around allegations of spying through its technology.
