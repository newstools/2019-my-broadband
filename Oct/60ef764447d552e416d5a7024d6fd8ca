WhatsApp is developing a dark mode for its Android application, WABetaInfo reports. The latest beta version of the app (version 2.19.282) includes information regarding the platform’s upcoming “Dark Theme” feature. Once implemented, this feature will be accessible through a new section under WhatsApp’s Settings menu titled Theme Settings. From within the Theme Settings menu, WhatsApp users will be able to choose between three options: Light Theme, Dark Theme, and System Default. The Light Theme is the standard WhatsApp colour scheme currently used in the application, while the Dark Theme adopts blue and black night colours instead. When System Default is selected, WhatsApp will automatically detect which theme is used by your Android operating system and set the same theme within the application. The Dark Theme option is still under development, and the new colour scheme does not yet have a release date. Another feature which first appeared in a previous beta version of WhatsApp for Android is “Disappearing Messages”, which will allow users to send messages that automatically delete themselves after a pre-defined period of time. WABetaInfo previously stated that Disappearing Messages is not yet available, and may not appear for users even after they update to the latest beta version of WhatsApp on Android.
