Eskom has announced that there is no load-shedding expected for Monday 21 October 2019, with the probability of load-shedding remaining low for the rest of the week. “Despite a constrained and vulnerable power system, no load-shedding is expected tomorrow, Monday 21 October 2019 and the probability of load-shedding remains low for the rest of the week,” Eskom said. Eskom said that several power units had been returned to service, with repairs on the conveyor belt at Medupi power station progressing well. “The system’s improvement is largely as a result of several units being returned to service from planned and unplanned maintenance, and achieving a healthy water level at our pumped storage schemes to prepare for the week ahead,” the power utility said. “Eskom continues to replenish diesel reserves for the open cycle gas turbines which enable us to avoid and/or minimise load-shedding.” Despite these improvements, Eskom warned that the load-shedding could still be implemented at short notice this week due to the constrained status of the power generation system. “Eskom would like to thank customers for their patience and support in reducing demand by using electricity sparingly and industrial customers for their participation in load containment,” the power utility said. This announcement follows the implementation of stage 1 load-shedding on Saturday, with controlled blackouts being lifted on Sunday.
