Sony has opened up cross-play to all developers on its PlayStation platform. The news was unveiled during an interview Wired conducted with Sony regarding its cloud gaming strategy for PlayStation. “While it’s not announcing the news explicitly, the PS4’s cross-play efforts have officially moved out of the beta stage, meaning that the console can support cross-play on any titles that studios provide the functionality for,” said Wired. This comes as huge news to online gamers, who until now have largely been unable to play multiplayer games across platforms due to Sony’s rigid stance on cross-platform support. Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said that Sony is making this move to ensure that it doesn’t get complacent despite beating Microsoft’s sales numbers for the current generation of consoles. “The track record of the incumbent platform winning the next time around is not a great one,” said Ryan. “So the major thrust of my executive energy is to avoid complacency.” Sony is expected to launch its next-generation console, the PlayStation 5, in 2020. The PlayStation 5 will support 8K video and ray-tracing, and will use powerful hardware such as SSD storage, a custom AMD Radeon Navi GPU, and an octa-core AMD chipset. Reputable gaming journalist Zenji Nishikawa also claims that Sony will launch its premium PlayStation 5 Pro at the same time as its standard model. This would reportedly be because Sony has realised that gamers want a high-end console as soon as possible.
