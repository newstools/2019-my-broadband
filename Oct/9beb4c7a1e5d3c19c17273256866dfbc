Thirty Spur Steak Ranches across South Africa have now been equipped with Sensormatic technology to ensure children are kept within a safe zone. The project, which was done in partnership with Fidelity ADT, started in May at the Spur outlet in Sunninghill. Sensormatic pedestals were placed at the entrance and exit of the store, and magnetic pinless tags were attached to children’s clothes as they entered the play area. “The proof of concept was so successful and well-received by patrons that the initiative has been rolled out to 29 other Spur franchises around the country,” said Ilze Van Eck, Retail Lead Fidelity ADT. On entry into the play area at a Spur restaurant, each child’s clothing is tagged by a childminder for that area. The tags attach securely without damaging the child’s clothing and staff are trained on where to attach the tag so it does not hurt the child in the play area. The tag can only be removed at the pay desk once the family leaves with the child. “If a child attempts to leave the restaurant without his or her parents an alarm activates,” van Eck said. She says this technology will go a long way to ensure that restaurants and other venues where children’s activities are on offer remain secure.
