Supersonic, MTN’s fixed line business which primarily focuses on fibre, was one of this year’s MyBroadband Conference sponsors. At the conference, Supersonic showcased their recently launched fixed LTE product, which has allowed them to move outside of the metros and into smaller and rural areas. “MTN has 95% LTE coverage, which really gives us a massive footprint, and that’s what we’re showcasing here at the MyBroadband Conference,” said Calvin Collett, CEO at Supersonic. As an innovative fixed line ISP, Supersonic places huge emphasis on their customer relations and follows a customer-centric approach. Simple innovations that they’ve implemented such as their WhatsApp chat line, have proven that this approach works. “Customers have really engaged in our WhatsApp chat line. 70% of our traffic comes in via WhatsApp,” said Collett. Supersonic is a strong competitor in the market and what sets them apart is that they “innovate while keeping things simple”. According to Collett, the MyBroadband Conference is the perfect platform where the average user can see what they’re about and where they fit in. “This year we decided to sponsor the MyBroadband Conference alongside MTN, as we thought that it is the right platform to show everybody that we’re part of MTN, which not everyone knows.” “Although we have the same colour, and it says everywhere we’re “brightened by MTN”, not everyone automatically affiliates the companies, and we wanted to make that affiliation known today,” said Collett.
