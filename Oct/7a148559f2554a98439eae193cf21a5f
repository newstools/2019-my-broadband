Microsoft has released an update for Windows 10 Preview that lets users answer and make phone calls on their Android device via their PC. The “Calls” feature was originally announced at the Samsung Unpacked event in August, before being showcased at Microsoft’s Surface event last week. A pre-release version is now available to Fast Ring testers via the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview build and will be rolled out to Windows Insiders in the coming days. The Calls feature runs on Windows 10’s Your Phone application, which manages the pairing of your smartphone to your PC, and utilizes the computer’s speakers, microphone and screen to enable full phone call functionality. Users can use answer, decline and make phone calls via their PC, in addition to diverting calls to the voicemail inbox and viewing their call history. The feature requires a device running Android 7.0 Nougat or higher and a Windows 10 PC with Bluetooth. Microsoft said that as this is an early build of the feature, there are currently still some problems. These include rare instances of connectivity loss between the PC and phone that require the user to repeat the pairing process.
