By Cheryl Otstott Do you realise the significance of October 22? It means something to you even if you don’t realise it. You see, Tuesday October 22, 2019, is the 81st  anniversary of the day the first xerographic image was produced and Xerography began. Without that special day, the Xerox printer or multifunction device you use would probably not exist. It is amazing to think how far the xerographic technology has come in over 80 years. Back on October 22, 1938 Chester Carlson, a patent attorney and part-time inventor, made the first xerographic image. The first image was a handwritten note that simply read “10-22-38 ASTORIA”. The copy is preserved in the Smithsonian Institution. If Carlson were still alive, he might be surprised to learn his invention began an information revolution that has continued to this day, making information readily available and expanding the world’s total knowledge. According to Megatrends in Digital Printing Applications 8.5 trillion letter-size simplex pages are printed annually in North America on products fathered by Carlson’s invention. Xerox has gone on to be a leader in innovation over the last 81 years. ConnectKey enabled office assistants, apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and printed electronics are just a few of the innovations that continue to be generated by minds at Xerox. Xerox is made to think. Xerox is building the future of work every day at our innovation centres. Take a look at this #MadeToThink video to see a few of the innovations and what we are up to on a daily basis.  You can see the innovations that have evolved from the xerographic technology and more at the Xerox Innovation site.
