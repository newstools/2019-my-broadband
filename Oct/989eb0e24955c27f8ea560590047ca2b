The 2019 MyBroadband Awards winners were announced at the annual MyBroadband Conference at Gallagher Estate in Midrand today. The MyBroadband Awards recognise excellence in the South African broadband and telecommunications industry. What sets our awards apart from others in this space is that they are based on research and real-world tests that show what South African consumers and businesses really experience. There were five awards this year – IT Person of the Year, Internet Service Provider of the Year, Best Fixed Network of the Year, Best Mobile Network of the Year, and Best Fibre Provider of the Year. The 2019 MyBroadband Awards were sponsored by Mind The Speed, South Africa’s newest fibre ISP. The winners of the 2019 MyBroadband Awards are listed below. The IT person of the year award recognises an individual who made a big difference in the South African telecommunications and broadband market. South Africa is blessed with many excellent leaders in the telecommunications market, which made this a closely contested award. Godfrey was selected as the winner for making MTN the best mobile network in South Africa and for creating positive momentum at the company. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323704 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards87-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards87-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards87-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards87-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards87-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The best mobile network award recognises excellence in network quality, with a strong focus on data services. This award is based on over 1 million network tests which were performed across South Africa to compare the performance of mobile networks. In 2019 MTN was a clear winner with a truly world-class network and nearly ubiquitous 4G coverage. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323706 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards92-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards92-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards92-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards92-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards92-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This award recognises excellence in the fixed network market. Many companies invested large amounts in their networks to serve an ever-changing telecommunications market. This year, Liquid Telecom stood out from its competitors for the biggest network modernisation project the company has undertaken in over a decade. The network refresh included replacing ageing infrastructure across its core and aggregation networks, and it can now promise a core network uptime of 99.999%. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323708 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards98-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards98-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards98-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards98-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards98-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Thanks to the steady liberalisation of South Africa’s telecommunications market since 2008, the fibre network operator market has also become vibrant with many companies competing for market share. Vumatel stood out this year for its ambitious plans to connect underserved neighbourhoods and its launch of prepaid fibre-to-the-home services. Having grown from a tiny startup in 2014 to one of the largest network operators in the country, Vumatel has truly brought fibre to South Africa and sparked a revolution in the market. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323712 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards106-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards106-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards106-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards106-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards106-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> South Africans are spoiled for choice when it comes to choosing an ISP. The local market is highly competitive, which has resulted in affordable prices and good service levels. To select a winner in the ISP category, MyBroadband looked at the feedback from tens of thousands of consumers who did speed tests and rated their service provider. Supersonic consistently topped the rankings thanks to its good service levels, quality network, and excellent support. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-323710 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards103-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards103-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards103-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards103-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Awards103-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
