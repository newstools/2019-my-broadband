The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has announced a new direction-finding feature for the Bluetooth 5.1 standard, which will greatly improve the technology’s location services. This new feature allows devices to track the direction of a Bluetooth signal, allowing for the development of proximity and positioning systems which are accurate down to the “centimetre-level”. Bluetooth 5.1-based proximity solutions will allow users to find devices with Bluetooth tags, and positioning systems using Bluetooth technology will allow for the refinement of indoor positioning systems and real-time locating services. These systems currently achieve metre-level accuracy, but this new technology will deliver greatly improved tracking. “Location services is one of the fastest growing solution areas for Bluetooth technology, and is forecasted to reach over 400 million products per year by 2022,” said Bluetooth SIG Director Mark Powell. The Bluetooth 5.1 core specification is available to developers from today.
