Rocket League’s developer Psyonix has announced that full cross-platform gaming is available to players. This will extend to all online match types, although players hoping to join cross-platform parties will need to wait until Rocket League’s next update. “Today’s announcement is an important one for us here at Psyonix, because we know how much our community has wanted full cross-platform support for quite some time,” said Psyonix. PlayStation 4 owners were previously limited to playing against others with the console and those playing on PC via Steam. This was due to Sony’s strict stance on cross-play, rather than the difficulty of implementation. Psyonix added that cross-play should be enabled by default, but if it isn’t, users can navigate to the options menu and tick the “Cross-Platform Play” box.
