MWEB has confirmed to MyBroadband that it will be forced to increase its prices on Vumatel’s “Fibrehoods” infrastructure. Fibre customers who originally signed up for their packages through Fibrehoods are facing price hikes across several ISPs. Vumatel told MyBroadband that it is bringing the legacy Fibrehoods pricing in line with its standard prices, resulting in price changes for ISPs. This means that ISPs are likely to pass the cost of the price increase to their customers, and it is currently unclear how this will be handled by all service providers. Vumatel said that it upgraded and integrated Fibrehoods fibre after it acquired the company in 2016 – and the new pricing will kick in on 1 March 2019. While certain ISPs have chose to move affected Vumatel clients to different packages – involving data cap and line speeds changes – MWEB said it has opted to move clients to the equivalent Vumatel product. This includes the same data allocation and line speed – and will result in a price increase for users. MWEB reiterated that this decision was due to changes on Vumatel’s end. MWEB stated that clients will be able to move to a different line speed or data package if they prefer after the price change is implemented, and it has a range of products for customers to choose from.
