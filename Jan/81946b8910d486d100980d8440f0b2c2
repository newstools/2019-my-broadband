Vodacom has issued a full statement on the matter between it and Please Call Me “inventor” Kenneth Makate. Vodacom stated last night that it was paying out “reasonable compensation” to Makate for his idea to develop the call-back service. “Vodacom can confirm that the group CEO [Shameel Joosub] has met with the legal representatives to convey his decision and determination on reasonable compensation,” said Vodacom spokesman Byron Kennedy. Following Vodacom’s statement, Makate denied a deal had been reached, however. EWN quoted Makate as saying that: “I haven’t reached any deal with Vodacom, I was dumped with some determination that the deal was done.” Read here – I have not agreed to any deal with Vodacom – Please Call Me “inventor” Vodacom has subsequently issued a full statement on the matter following Makate’s rebuttal. “In line with the Constitutional Court Order, the Vodacom Group Chief Executive Officer was directed to determine the amount of reasonable compensation payable to Mr. Kenneth Makate for the idea that led to the development of the Please Call Me product, in the event of Vodacom and Mr. Makate’s negotiating teams failing to reach agreement on the quantum of such reasonable compensation,” said Vodacom. “Mr. Shameel Joosub, in his judicially determined deadlock breaking role, received oral and written representations from both parties after the negotiations between the two parties had deadlocked. Oral hearings were held on 4-5 October 2018.” “The Group CEO has met with the legal representatives of Mr. Makate and Vodacom to convey his decision and determination. In the spirit of the confidentiality agreement both parties signed as part of the negotiating process, Vodacom will not disclose the amount set by the Group CEO, as reasonable compensation. Vodacom considers the matter as finally settled and closed.” “Vodacom can confirm that Mr Makate’s funds will be transferred as soon as we have the banking account details.”
