When talking with customers and partners alike, productivity and security led the conversation throughout 2018. Now that 2019 is here, the conversation is taking a new turn thanks to the introduction of key enhancements to Xerox’s popular AltaLink multifunction printers (MFPs). Xerox recently announced that new, free, software enhancements are available for the AltaLink Workplace Assistants enabled with ConnectKey Technology. These enhancements are good news for businesses of all sizes who will now be able to monitor critical security settings and automatically reset unauthorized changes, a proactive step in stemming security breaches. Plus, a new intuitive user experience gives workers more ways to customize everyday tasks – maximizing time and improving productivity. IT administrators are all too familiar with the way that accidental changes to security settings by non-security staff can lead to breaches. With AltaLink’s new Configuration Watchdog, administrators can ensure devices stay configured to their defined security policies in order to safeguard critical business data without external monitoring. And, they can monitor compliance requirements of up to eight security settings. “Cybersecurity threats are becoming more sophisticated and so is Xerox’s response,” said Dr. Alissa J. Abdullah, chief information security officer, Xerox. “We take a proactive approach to device, data and document security that puts organizations on the offensive when it comes to threat detection and response.” For additional protection, the AltaLink MFPs include support for ThinPrint print management software, featuring end-to-end encryption, as well as efficient compression and streaming of print data, delivering faster output speeds. Xerox enhances printer security with free software upgrade for AltaLink workplace assistants. With an intuitive user experience, AltaLink Workplace Assistants make completing daily tasks faster and easier with three new features: Key feature enhancements like these help ensure our customers’ AltaLink Workplace Assistants tackle today’s evolving workplace challenges, and stay ready for the future.
