HMD Global is set to launch a new Nokia smartphone with a 5-camera system on the rear, according to multiple leaks. Tech leaker Evan Blass has posted a photo of the device online, and said it is called the Nokia 9 PureView. According to a report by The Verge, HMD Global bought the PureView brand from Microsoft in 2018 after partnering with Zeiss for its Android smartphone cameras. Previous PureView-branded devices include the Nokia 808 and Lumia 1020, it added. The new Nokia 9 will have five camera sensors on the back of its case, arranged in a hexagon formation that includes a flash and sensor. With five cameras working together for each photo, the device is expected to provide much better shots in low-light conditions – along with a range of other enhancements. This was the case when Samsung launched its first four-camera smartphone, the Galaxy A9, in October 2018. Samsung said the camera system lets users “capture dynamic and beautiful photos effortlessly”. The cameras, combined with AI Scene Recognition and Scene Optimizer, let users “shoot like a pro” and manually manage a photo’s depth of field, it added. Engadget reported that the Nokia 9 will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB RAM, and have 128GB of internal storage. The display is a 6-inch screen with a “2K” resolution, and will feature HDR10 support. Another feature of the display is an under-screen fingerprint sensor, which removes the need for a sensor on the back or front of the chassis. Reports added that the Nokia 9 will be part of the Android One programme, which means it will receive the latest Android software updates and will run the latest version of the operating system. No launch date or pricing for the Nokia 9 PureView were detailed.
