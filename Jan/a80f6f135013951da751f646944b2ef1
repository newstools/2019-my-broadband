A leaked UserBenchmark result has revealed an AMD Ryzen processor with 12 physical cores and 24 threads. The information also points to a clock speed of up to 3.6GHz and compatibility with an AM4 chipset, leading users to believe the CPU will be a Ryzen third-generation product. AMD recently announced its third-generation Ryzen desktop processors at CES 2019. These new processors will be manufactured on the company’s 7nm process node and will feature improved power efficiency compared to current-generation Ryzen chips. The performance boost over Intel chips is shown in the leaked result, with the new 12-core Ryzen beating the Intel Core i9-9900K in multi-threaded benchmarks. There is currently no model line-up, pricing, or exact launch date for AMD’s new Ryzen third-generation CPUs.
