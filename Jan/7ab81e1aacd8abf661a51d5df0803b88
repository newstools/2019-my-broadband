MyBroadband’s Android and iOS Speed Test Apps are used by thousands of South Africans to test the performance of their mobile network. MyBroadband’s Speed Test platform was developed specifically for South Africa, and all tests are done to independent servers hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband Speed Test platform. Data from these speed tests is used to provide an accurate view of the performance of local networks, including Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom, and Rain. By running a speed test you stand a chance to win prizes worth R5,000. Here’s what you should do: Please note that mobile data used for speed tests on your mobile network will count towards your monthly usage allowance, and these speed tests can use a lot of data when testing a high-speed network. Good news is that MTN has zero-rated the MyBroadband Speed Test App, which means MTN subscribers will not be charged for the data used when running speed tests. The giveaway winners will be selected and announced on 31 January 2019.
