Uber has launched its UberEats food delivery platform in Paarl, allowing residents to order from a selection of the town’s restaurants. UberEats delivers food to customers in an average of 30-40 minutes and includes a number of promotions and partnerships which change on a regular basis. “We are always excited to expand to a new city not only because we are bringing eaters an innovative way to order their meals, but because it affords us the opportunity to give delivery-partners an additional earning opportunity,” said Uber Eats South Africa GM Ailyssa Pretorius. Paarl residents can order food through UberEats from 10:00 until 22:00 every day, and they can use the “EATSPAARL” promotional code to get free delivery off their first three orders. This promotional code is valid for three months.
