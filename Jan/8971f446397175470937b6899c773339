Google has stated that it will deprecate 32-bit Android apps, and has set a deadline for developers to ensure their apps meet its 64-bit requirements. “64-bit CPUs deliver faster, richer experiences for your users. Adding a 64-bit version of your app provides performance improvements, makes way for future innovation, and sets you up for devices with 64-bit only hardware,” said Google. The developer deadline is 1 August 2019, and from this date all new apps and updates that include native code are required to provide 64-bit versions in addition to 32-bit versions. From August 2021, Google Play will stop serving apps without 64-bit versions on 64-bit capable devices. “Supporting 64-bit prepares the ecosystem for the innovation enabled by the advanced compute capabilities of 64-bit devices, and for future Android devices that only support 64-bit code.” Google added that the 64-bit deadline does not affect APKs or app bundles that are designed for its Wear OS operating system.
