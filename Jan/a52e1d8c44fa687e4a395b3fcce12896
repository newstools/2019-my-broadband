MSI has unveiled its new line-up of high-end gaming laptops at CES 2019, boasting Nvidia RTX graphics cards and 8th-gen Intel processors. The new gaming laptop range includes refreshed MSI GS Stealth, GE Raider, GT Titan, and GL notebooks, with each device available in a number of configurations to meet the needs of any gamer. Each of the new notebook models is available with 15.6-inch or 17.3-inch displays and each device features discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics, delivering extreme gaming performance in a portable form factor. Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics use enhanced rendering and ray-tracing techniques to greatly improve the quality of in-game graphics, and MSI has enhanced the Cooler Boost design of its new laptops to take full advantage of the hardware’s capabilities. MSI’s GS65 Stealth is the highlight of the company’s new laptop line-up, and has been awarded the CES Innovation Award thanks to its powerful performance and ultra-portable design. The MSI GS65 and GS75 Stealth notebooks are the world’s first ultra-thin gaming laptops with Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics, leveraging Nvidia’s Max-Q design technology to offer powerful performance in a standard laptop frame.
