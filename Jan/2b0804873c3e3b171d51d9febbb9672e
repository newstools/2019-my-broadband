Speed versus storage space – it is a decision you make every time you buy a new PC or storage drive. For those needing massive amounts of space on their PC to save files and programmes, a mechanical hard drive is the way to go. However, hard drives are substantially slower than 2.5-inch SSDs. These SSDs are the middle-ground between speed and storage, offering good storage capacity at a good price. Then, at the top of the speed pyramid we have M.2 NVMe SSDs, which provide lightning speed – with the PCIe versions the fastest – but come at a high price if you want lots of space. This is demonstrated by the typical data transfer speeds of the storage drives: To help you decide which drive is for you, we have put together a list of great hard drive and SSD deals currently available.
