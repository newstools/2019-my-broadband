Reuters reports that WhatsApp will be limiting the number of times a message can be forwarded by a single user. Previously, a single message could be forwarded up to 20 times by a single WhatsApp user. The new limit is five. The Facebook-owned messaging app cited its intention to combat “misinformation and rumours” as the reason for the change. The new limit was already in place in India, where WhatsApp implemented this change to fight against rumours that led to killings and attempted lynchings. WhatsApp has been criticised for being a vehicle for the spread of “fake news,” photoshopped images, and other misleading media content. An update containing the new limit will be released today, according to WhatsApp head of communications Carl Woog.
