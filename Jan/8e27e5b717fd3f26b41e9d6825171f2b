A report by DigiTimes claims that Apple’s second-generation AirPods will release in the first half of 2019. These AirPods are expected to offer an updated design, described as “discrete” by the publication. Apple’s current AirPods have performed very well at leading retailers since their release in 2016. DigiTimes predicts that wearable devices such as the AirPods will continue to see growth in 2019, potentially making the release of a new range highly profitable for Apple. Apple’s new AirPods are also expected to place a heavy emphasis on health monitoring features, according to the report. This would be the latest move in Apple’s push towards implementing health tracking in its devices – including the Apple Watch 4 Series, which can detect issues such as heart disease and whether the user has fallen.
