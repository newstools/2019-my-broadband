Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has requested all South Africans to stop using Vodacom products and services, in a bid to put pressure on the mobile network. Lesufi made the statement as part of a campaign supporting Kenneth Makate, who is in a battle with Vodacom over his involvement in the company’s Please Call Me service. Vodacom has reportedly offered Makate R49 million as compensation for his Please Call Me idea, but Makate has rejected the offer. Following the rejection, Lesufi held a press conference to voice his support for Makate. Lesufi has called on South Africans to support Makate, and stated that he must be compensated for his idea. “There is a serious commercial injustice here,” said Lesufi. If Vodacom fails to pay Makate by 1 February, it will result in the following measures being taken, said Lesufi. A final resolution between Vodacom and Makate must be found by 28 February, stated Lesufi. This is despite Vodacom saying it is ready and willing to pay Makate, and it is up to him to accept their offer. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
