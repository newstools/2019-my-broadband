MacRumors has reported that Apple will launch its AirPower wireless charging mat soon. The report stated that a source indicated the charging mat is now in production. This follows Apple previewing its charging mat in September 2017 – after which the company stated it would be released sometime in 2018. This did not take place however. Pricing for the mat has also not been announced. The Verge reported that in June 2018 Apple was rumoured to be having problems with the charging mat, including overheating when it charged three devices at once. Apple’s AirPower mat will let users charge supported iPhones, Apple Watches, and AirPods wirelessly.
