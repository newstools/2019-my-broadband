Battlefield V is suffering from poor sales, which is impacting its publisher Electronic Arts (EA). According to a report by Seeking Alpha, the game has experienced consumer backlash for a “less authentic portrayal of WWII”. “The limited nature of Battlefield V’s single player campaign at launch, unimplemented cooperative missions, and the delay for the battle royale mode frustrated players,” added the report. In a bid to improves sales, many retailers are offering Battlefield V for between 33% to 50% off. Owners of Battlefield I were also recently offered the game at 50% off. EA has subsequently revised its sales forecasts for the game, while its share price has dropped by 45% since July 2018, added the report. “Full-year net bookings guidance was cut by $350 million dollars,” it concluded.
