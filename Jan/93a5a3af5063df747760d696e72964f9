WASPA has secured the services of French anti-fraud firm Evina in a bid to fight fraud in the South African mobile industry. According to WASPA, fraudulent attacks on local mobile network operators and systems have become a big problem. “Specialist tactics are required to combat fast-moving, guerrilla-style hacking attempts,” said WASPA general manager Ilonka Badenhorst. WASPA chose Evina after a tender process which involved the submission of proposals by six firms. “Our experts have a long history of on-the-ground experience in beating mobile fraudsters,” said Evina CEO David Lofti. “From fraudulent app installs to click cons, our artificial intelligence-based protection kit blocks fraudulent mobile transactions while continuously adding to our corporate anti-fraud IP.” Badenhorst added that the partnership will allow WASPA to take its “commitment to the SA mobile consumer to a whole new level.”
