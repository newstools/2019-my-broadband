The all-new comic-book thriller Glass finds David Dunn (Bruce Willis) – the hero from Unbreakable – in pursuit of The Beast (James McAvoy) – from Split – in a series of escalating encounters. The shadowy presence of Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), also known by his pseudonym Mr. Glass, emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men. The film returns Dunn as the unbreakable vigilante bound to battle Kevin Wendell Crumb and the 23 distinct personalities who reside within him as The Beast, but this time around, and just as the movie’s title suggests, the attention is mainly focused on Mr. Glass. Glass’s character is a brilliant yet disturbed villain with an affinity for comic books and has a rare bone disorder that causes his bones to be as fragile and brittle as glass. As Shyamalan fans would expect, the movie is centered around a major showdown between a hero and two villains, concluding in a twist at the end. According to reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes, viewers can look forward to action scenes that are “bone-crunchingly satisfying”, as well as McAvoy’s best on-screen performance to date, as he effectively manages to slip in and out of each identity. “McAvoy lights up the screen with his eerie physicality every time he appears and cascades crazily through the Horde’s personalities like a human radio with a dial that can’t stop spinning,” said one review. Jackson also impresses as he “outperforms anyone sharing his scenes without even saying a word.” The film will debut in South African theatres on Friday, 18 January 2019. Book your tickets today.
