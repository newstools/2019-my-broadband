Michael Page has released its South African salary survey for 2019, detailing salary trends across a variety of industries. The recruitment consultancy said the South African labour market is unpredictable, and despite the emergence from a recession the unemployment rate remains as high as it was in 2017. A positive outlook is expected for 2019 however, with the unemployment rate expected to decrease as international investment improves. The salary survey found that salaries and bonuses have continued their trend of steadily increasing to meet inflationary pressure, and skilled workers in South Africa are able to command higher salaries due to a low supply of talent. The Michael Page South African 2019 salary survey reflects the minimum, maximum, and average salaries for a variety of positions â€“ including those in the technology sector. Separate figures are reflected for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinational corporations (MNCs), with the latter generally providing larger average salaries across all positions. For example, the chief technology officer of a South African SME can earn between R1 million and R1.4 million, while the salary for the same position can vary between R1.1 million and R1.8 million and an MNC. The table below details the findings of the 2019 South African salary survey.
