LG has unveiled a “world-first” at CES 2019, a rollable OLED TV that packs itself away when you are finished using it. The new TV is called the Signature OLED TV R – model 65R9 – and features a 4K (3,840 x 2,60) display that rolls up into a stylish base. “LG has created a TV with a display that uses revolutionary flexible screen technology that allows the screen to roll up and roll back out when needed,” said LG. “The ‘R’ in the new Signature OLED TV R is about creating a revolution in home entertainment and redefining space through its ability to rise and roll-up at the touch of a button.” The TV can place itself in three viewing configurations, depending on what the user needs. These are: These three positions are shown in the image below, and can be controlled with user voice commands or button touch.  LG said the Signature TV is powered by its second-generation Alpha 9 processor and deep learning algorithm. The device also supports Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, along with Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit – making the TV a hub for home automation. Another feature of the TV punted by LG is its built-in sound system, which packs 4.2-channel output (100W) and support for Dolby Atmos. This is all wrapped in a brushed aluminum casing with a wool speaker cover. LG did not reveal finalised launch details, but the TV will be priced for the “premium” category and is expected to ship later in 2019.
