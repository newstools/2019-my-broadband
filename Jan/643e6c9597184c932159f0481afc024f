The Raspberry Pi Foundation has launched its latest mini-computer for industrial and enterprise customers, named the Compute Module 3+. This device is the next iteration of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 and includes a number of new features. It has 32GB of eMMC flash storage and a quad-core CPU with a speed of 1.2GHz, making it a relatively powerful mini computer which has a standard DDR2 SODIMM form factor. This means that the Compute Module 3+ is the size of a RAM stick, and is compatible with laptop motherboards. The device can be purchased from the Raspberry Pi website.
