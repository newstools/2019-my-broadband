Apple has reported that revenue from iPhone sales decreased by 15% year-on-year in its first fiscal quarter of 2019. The disappointing sales numbers have been well documented, and many have blamed the high price of these smartphones. The company also posted a total quarterly revenue of $84.3 billion – down 5% from the previous year. Apple lauded the success of its other products and services, however, for which revenue grew by 19% year-on-year. “While it was disappointing to miss our revenue guidance, we manage Apple for the long term and this quarter’s results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. Cook added that the number of active Apple devices reached an all-time high of 1.4 billion in the past quarter. Apple has predicted revenue of between $55 billion and $59 billion for the second quarter – down from the $61.1 billion that it earned in the second quarter of 2018.
