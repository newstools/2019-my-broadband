Uber has announced the launch of its Uber Lite app for Android in South Africa. The “Lite” version of the ride-hailing app sports a new interface designed to make booking rides quicker and easier with limited hardware or network resources. Uber said the app works in low-connectivity areas, on basic Android phones, and with limited data plans. Uber Lite uses less than 5MB of data to download and takes up much less storage than the standard app. The app’s “tap over type” functionality automatically selects your current location as a pickup point, allows users to select a nearby point of interest instead of typing where they are, and stores the city’s top places so that no network connection is needed for them to appear. Uber Lite will also only load maps and navigation when requested, saving on data costs. Core functionality of the Uber platform such as support, safety features, an emergency button, and the ability to share your trip are all available in Uber Lite.
