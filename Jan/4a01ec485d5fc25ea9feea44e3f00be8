ISPs with packages on Vumatel’s network recently announced price increases and line speed changes for customers on legacy Fibrehood infrastructure. Vumatel said that it upgraded and integrated Fibrehoods fibre after it acquired the company in 2016, part of which meant changing the old infrastructure pricing. “In acquiring Fibrehoods in 2016, Vumatel embarked on a process to integrate and upgrade the acquired infrastructure and operations to meet the business’s and customers’ required service levels and standards,” Vumatel said. The alignment of all legacy Fibrehoods pricing to that of the standard Vumatel pricing post integration of the networks will come into effect on 1 March 2019. This means that ISPs may pass the cost of the price increase to their customers, and it is currently unclear how this will be handled by major service providers. For example, one Webafrica customer’s uncapped 20/20 Mbps fibre package was lowered to a 20/2 Mbps line while his monthly price was increased by R50. Vumatel said the price hikes allow it to run a sustainable, high-quality network with good service levels.
