DStv Now is the online version of DStv and it’s available to all DStv subscribers at no extra cost. It works like other streaming apps, with the difference being that live content is also available, like SuperSport. Here are a few features of the DStv Now app that you might not know about: If you forgot to record a series you’re watching or an episode of Carte Blanche, open the DStv Now app on your phone (or go to now.dstv.com) and find the show in the TV Guide section and hit the red Record button. Your Explora must be connected to the Internet for this to work. There’s always that one friend who borrows your books and doesn’t return them. Same with logins. Open the DStv Now app, go to Settings > Account > Manage Devices and click Remove Device if you don’t recognise the device name. Go into Settings and look for Kids > Kids PIN. When your children try to exit Kids Mode it’ll ask for your PIN code. If you don’t have uncapped fibre or ADSL at home, connect to the Wi-Fi at the office or a coffee shop and download episodes, movies, even sports highlights. Download up to 25 videos and they’ll remain on your device for 30 days. Once you click ‘Play’ you have 48 hours to watch it. Before downloading the DStv Now app, register for DStv Now and create a username and password. This article was published in partnership with DStv Now.
