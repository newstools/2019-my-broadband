Tech leaker Evan Blass has posted an image of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S10 range on his Twitter profile. The image shows three different models, which Blass said will be named the Samsung Galaxy S10E, S10, and S10+. The base version includes a two-lens back camera, whereas the two larger devices both offer a triple-lens system. The lack of a fingerprint sensor on the back of the devices is also notable. The Galaxy S9 and Note 9 both came with their fingerprint sensors on the back. The S10 range will reportedly embed a fingerprint sensor into the display. According to Softpedia News, however, the base version of the S10 is more likely to position its sensor on the side of the device. Other reports indicate the base S10 model will include 6GB RAM and will run Android Pie, whereas the larger models could offer 8GB RAM. The Galaxy S10 range will be unveiled on 20 February, and is expected to go on sale from 8 March.
