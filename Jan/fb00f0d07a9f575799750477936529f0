A high-speed Internet connection is vital in the connected age, as it can make a world of difference in ensuring operations run smoothly and can ultimately improve productivity. Businesses can access high-speed Internet by deploying a fibre optic broadband connection. Fibre broadband uses fibre optic cables to transfer data over long distances and can transfer much more data compared to traditional ADSL, and at an incredible throughput rate. With fibre’s rapid roll-out across the country, ISPs like PacketSky – a prominent, fast-growing ISP – now specialise in providing premium quality fibre solutions on an extensive range of available fibre networks for home and business.
