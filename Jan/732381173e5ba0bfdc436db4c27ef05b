Audio-Technica has unveiled its new top-of-the-line, over-ear headphones – the ATH-ANC900BT. The headphones use Audio-Technica’s new digital hybrid active noise cancellation (ANC) technology, utilising various techniques and numerous microphones to ensure that noise is reduced to optimal levels. These new headphones include 40mm drivers, as well as a diamond-like carbon (DLC) exterior that optimises the detail and impact of these headphones. When using Bluetooth and noise-cancelling, the headphones can last for up to 35 hours and use a USB charging cable. They also come with a 1.2-metre audio cable. The ATH-ANC900BT headphones will be priced at $299 and will be available in the second quarter of 2019. Audio-Technica also announced its budget ATH-ANC500BT over-ear headphones, which offer up to 20 hours of Bluetooth and noise-cancelling usage before the battery dies. The ATH-ANC100BT were also unveiled, and are wireless in-ear headphones which allow for 10 hours of continuous use, and utilise 12mm drivers. Both the ATH-ANC500BT and ATH-ANC100BT audio devices will retail for $99, and will be available in the second quarter of 2019.
