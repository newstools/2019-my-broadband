Leaks by German website AllAboutSamsung now offer the best look at Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 range so far. One image shows that the smartphones will use Infinity O displays, and that the front camera will be situated within the screen. Additionally, the photos don’t show any fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, which almost certainly confirms that it will be positioned within the display. The images show that the range will include a headphone jack, allowing users to use standard headphones with these smartphones. Previous rumours have suggested that the Galaxy S10 will come with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet, and will be available in a version that offers 5G and 1TB storage. The new S10 range will be unveiled on 20 February at an event in San Francisco, while the device is expected to begin shipping on 8 March.
