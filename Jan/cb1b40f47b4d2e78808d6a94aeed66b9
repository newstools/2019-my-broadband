Nissan has unveiled the latest addition to its electric car range – the new LEAF e+. Nissan’s new LEAF offers increased power through its powertrain, expanding the vehicle’s range by around 40%. “The LEAF e+ is ‘more’ LEAF, offering customers more choice in terms of power and range,” said Daniele Schillaci, vice president of Nissan. It offers a new 70kW quick charging system with a 100kW peak, which takes a similar time to charge than the current LEAF does with its 50kW system. The vehicle’s battery is covered by a limited warranty of 8 years or 160,000km – whichever occurs first. Included in the new iteration of the LEAF is Nissan’s ProPILOT technology, which is an in-lane, semi-autonomous driving technology that automatically adjusts the distance between you and the vehicle ahead. Every LEAF e+ is also available with a variety of advanced safety technologies including Intelligent Lane Intervention, Lane Departure Warning, Intelligent Emergency Braking, Blind Spot Warning, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, and Intelligent Around View Monitor with moving object detection. The vehicle is scheduled to be released in Japan in January 2019, while US and European sales will occur closer to mid-2019.
