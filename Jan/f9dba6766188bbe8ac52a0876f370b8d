Toyota has unveiled its latest sports car, the GR Supra. This is the fifth generation of the Supra, and the latest model is produced by Toyota GAZOO Racing. “Conceived as a sports car in its purest form, the new Toyota GR Supra builds on the heritage of Toyota’s past Supra generations and the 2000GT sports car with its classic layout of a front-mounted, straight-six engine driving the rear wheels.” said Toyota. It packs a 3.0-litre 6-cylinder engine which has a twin-scroll turbocharger. This produces 250kW and 500Nm of torque, and is linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. This takes the GR Supra from 0-100km/h in 4.3 seconds and to a top speed of 250km/h. Toyota said it has also included Normal and Sport driving mode options, along with a launch control feature for fast take-offs. The new Toyota GR Supra will be launched in mid-2019 in South Africa. No pricing or availability information was shared.
