FNB has announced that over 60,000 of its customers have registered for The Entertainer in the two weeks since the bank partnered with the platform. The Entertainer offers two-for-one discounts at a variety of venues, from restaurants and beauty salons to gyms and hotels, for the duration of 2019. Users of The Entertainer app usually pay an annual fee of R495 per city. However, FNB and RMB Private Bank customers do not need to pay the annual fee for the year. FNB added that it will explore future discounted subscription fees based on customer adoption and service usage over the course of this year. “This is a value-added service which makes our customers’ money go further,” said eBucks Rewards CEO Johan Moolman. “We recognise the unstable economic conditions we live in, where our customers are forced to be frugal when it comes to leisure activities.” “This exciting partnership with The Entertainer allows our customers to enjoy doing the things they love doing whilst making the most of their budgets,” Moolman said. To use The Entertainer, customers must be eBucks Rewards Members and have the latest version of the FNB app installed. They can then log in to the FNB app, navigate to The Entertainer under the eBucks Rewards menu, and follow the prompts to register.
