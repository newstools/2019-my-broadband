Nvidia is working on a new graphics card which will be named the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, according to VideoCardz. The graphics card will be the manufacturer’s first Turing-based GPU launched under its GTX brand. While it will lack technology such as ray tracing, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti could be positioned as a much cheaper product than RTX GPUs while delivering good performance. According to the report, the GTX 1660 Ti will feature 1,536 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM, and a 192-bit memory interface. The report stated that while there is no launch date available, the graphics card is expected to release in the near future – as the GeForce GTX 1060 falls out of the market.
