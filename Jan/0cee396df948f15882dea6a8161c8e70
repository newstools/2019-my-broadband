Three years after Windows 10 was launched to the public, the operating system has finally overtaken Windows 7 in desktop market share. This is according to data from NetMarkeShare, which tracks operating system and browser usage. According to its data, in December 2018 Windows 10 reached 39.22% desktop OS market share, while Windows 7 was at 36.90%. This follows Windows 10 gaining share throughout 2018, starting the year on 34.29% – while Windows 7 started on 42.39%. It is interesting to note that Windows XP is still listed in the rankings, with 4.54% market share. This may be attributed to corporate or company usage, and a lack of upgrades by their IT department. Steam’s statistics tell a similar story, and the gaming platform states that 63.79% of users are running Windows 10 (64 bit) as of December 2018. By comparison, 26.08% of users on Steam are on Windows 7 (64 bit).
