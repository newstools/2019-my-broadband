AMD plans to launch new Ryzen processors in the middle of 2019, the company has stated at CES 2019. The Ryzen 3 processors will use a 7nm process and produce high-performance results, said the company. As part of the unveiling of the Ryzen 3 processors, tests using Cinebench were conducted and the results compared against an Intel Core i9-9900K. As reported by AnandTech, the Ryzen 3 produced the same results as the Intel CPU, but drew less power. The unveiling of the new CPUs comes after AMDâ€™s previous-generation Ryzen CPUs were launched to praise from gamers and system builders. No model line-up, pricing, or exact launch date for the new CPUs were shared by AMD.
