According to TechRadar, Samsung will host its Galaxy S10 launch event on 20 February 2019. The “Galaxy Unpacked 2019” event will take place in San Francisco, and will “mark the 10-year anniversary of the Galaxy series,” said Samsung in the event invite. While the company did not technically say that the S10 would be launched at the event, the “10” emblazoned across the event invite all but confirms that Samsung will announce its new top-end smartphone. Rumours suggest the Galaxy S10 will have a reduced top bezel, as well as a front camera situated in the top right corner of the device. Other rumours say that the S10 will include an in-screen fingerprint sensor, a three-lense rear camera, and a 7nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset. Samsung is expected to release multiple versions of the S10. The top-of-the-range S10 Plus is expected to have a 6.4-inch screen and a 4,000mAh battery. The standard S10 could have a 6.1-inch display and a 3,500mAh battery, while the S10 Lite will offer a 3,000mAh battery and 5.8-inch screen.
