The upcoming version of Google’s mobile operating system, Android Q, will include a number of unique features. XDA Developers installed an experimental build of the operating system on the Google Pixel 3 XL, providing insight into the new functionality provided by Android Q. One of the most notable changes is a system-wide dark theme, which can be configured in Display Settings and replaces the standard white background with a dark grey. This feature is said to work in both native and third-party apps, thanks to an option to force a dark interface within applications that do not support a dark theme. Another new developer option is “force desktop mode”, which may act as a Samsung Dex-like feature to enable a desktop mode when your smartphone is connected to a display. Android Q will also include an overhaul of app permissions, allowing users to see which permissions each of their installed apps requires and uses. Other features included in the Android Q build include a new lock screen option, a “sensors off” toggle, and settings for pop-up notifications.
