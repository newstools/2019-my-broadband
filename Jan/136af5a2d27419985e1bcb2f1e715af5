BCX has appointed Werner Lindemann as its new Chief Sales Officer – with the new title replacing “Chief Revenue Officer”. Lindemann’s appointment was confirmed in an internal email sent to BCX staff, which MyBroadband has seen. He previously worked as the managing director of MediaMark, and has also worked in South Africa, Dubai, and Zurich as a consultant, sales director, and VP of sales at companies such as IBM and PwC. He holds MBL, MEng, and BEng Industrial Engineering qualifications. Lindemann’s job will be centred on the creation of a sales culture within BCX, with a focus on driving above-industry growth rates. Lindemann will replace Marius Schafer, who took on the role 8 months ago during significant organisational changes. Schafer will continue to work at BCX in a yet-to-be-disclosed position. Telkom was asked to confirm the appointment, but was not immediately available for comment.
