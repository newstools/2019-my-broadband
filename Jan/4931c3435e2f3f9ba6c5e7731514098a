These are all detailed below.  The Archer AX6000 is designed with the Smart Home in mind, as it can connect to many devices simultaneously.

It also packs built-in antivirus protection, including a threat database that is updated live. The AX6000 is available for $349, said TP-Link.  The other new router, the Archer AX11000, is touted by TP-Link as its flagship gaming router. It is equipped with high-end hardware, including a 1.8GHz quad-core processor, three Wi-Fi co-processors, 1GB of RAM, and 512MB Flash memory. This router offers 1,148Mbps speeds on its 2.4GHz band, as well as 4,804Mbps speeds on its 5GHz band.
