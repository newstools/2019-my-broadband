After a photograph of the new Samsung Galaxy S10 range was leaked, more rumours about Samsung’s upcoming flagship have come to the fore. Softpedia News reports that the Galaxy S10 will launch with at least 128GB of storage space. Additionally, the new flagship could offer users a minimum of 6GB RAM. A 5G version of the S10 is rumoured to offer a minimum of 256GB storage, with a possible maximum storage cap of 1TB. It is also expected to offer a minimum of 8GB RAM, but would potentially set buyers back as much as $1,700 – $250 more than the iPhone Xs Max was originally listed for. The 5G version of the S10 will be available in partnership with selected carriers who can support its 5G capabilities – none of which would be South African. The S10 range will be announced on 20 February, and is expected to be released on 8 March.
