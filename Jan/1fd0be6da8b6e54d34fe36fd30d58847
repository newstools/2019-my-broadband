MyBroadband forum members recently discovered an exposed route on Rain’s network following a report of an abnormal SIM set-up by a Rain user. A forum member stated that when setting up a friend’s router using a Rain Mobile SIM, he was presented with two login pages. Both pages had 172.16.0.x addresses and displayed the following: Following his post, several forum members attempted to access the login pages using their Rain connections. They stated that the first page appeared to be for a switch on the Rain network, which “should be hidden behind a firewall”. The second page was a login page for a networked camera, which could reportedly be accessed using default login credentials. After it was accessed, a screenshot of the camera feed was posted which showed what appears to be a portion of a data centre – a cage with server racks in it.  MyBroadband contacted Rain about the issue, and the company responded immediately thanking us for the information. Shortly after this, Rain informed us the issue had been fixed. Rain CEO Willem Roos stated that they recently moved offices and rationalised their data centres, which required the creation of a temporary network route. “Our team unfortunately erred in not removing the route once the project was complete,” said Roos. Roos said it must be emphasised that no sensitive data was accessible via the route and no data breach occurred. He added that: “This is certainly an error on our part, and we have improved our processes to minimise the chances of a recurrence.”
