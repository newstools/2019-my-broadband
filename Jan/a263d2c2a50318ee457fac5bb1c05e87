A new South African speed test platform – hosted at Speedtest.co.za – has been launched to give local Internet users an accurate performance assessment of their Internet connection. Speedtest.co.za is powered by MyBroadband and uses the same speed test engine as many prominent international performance measurement platforms. The new speed test platform has servers at NapAfrica’s Internet peering points in Johannesburg and Cape Town to provide a vendor-neutral testing environment. These servers are connected via a 10Gbps link to NapAfrica to ensure there is ample capacity for accurate speeds of even the fastest broadband connections. The Speedtest.co.za platform has a clean interface without ad clutter, and makes it easy for users to measure their download speed, upload speed, and latency. It was built to work on desktops, tablets, and smartphones, which means users can test their fixed or mobile speed on any device. Users can also rate their Internet service provider, share their results on social media, and use the platform to request a fibre upgrade.
