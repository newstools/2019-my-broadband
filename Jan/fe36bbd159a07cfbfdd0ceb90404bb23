Ster-Kinekor hiked its movie ticket prices towards the end of 2018, with moviegoers at some cinemas now paying 20% more. This was the second price increase for Ster-Kinekor in one year, though its initial price adjustment was generally below inflation. The second time round, however, the increases were all well over the average inflation rate from January to November 2018.
