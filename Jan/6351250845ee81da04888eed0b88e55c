A new report from Hootsuite and We Are Social shows that the average person spends 6 hours and 42 minutes online per day. This is actually a slight decrease from the 6 hours and 49 minutes that last year’s study showed. “Our suspicion is that this drop may be in part due to the large number of new users who are still learning how to use the Internet,” said the report. South Africans use the Internet significantly more than the international average. The average Internet user in South Africa spends 8 hours and 25 minutes online per day – over a third of their life. This is despite South Africa having one of the lowest average fixed Internet connection speeds in the world. However, our average mobile Internet connection speed is slightly higher than the 25.1 Mbps world average, coming in at 25.5 Mbps. Graphs from the report outlining this data can be found below.
