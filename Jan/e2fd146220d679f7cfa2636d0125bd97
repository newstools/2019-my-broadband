Codehesion is one of South Africa’s top Android App development companies and has rapidly grown its portfolio of successful projects. In 2018, Codehesion successfully developed various Android and web-app projects, which included two large eCommerce projects. These eCommerce projects involved custom-designed platforms with easy-to-use dashboards for the company and its clients. These projects were both completed on time and within budget – a big achievement in the software development market. Codehesion CEO Hector Beyers said it is great to have a 100% success rate for its software development projects in 2018. “Our simple 4-step consultation and software-development process has proven to be highly effective, particularly for businesses requiring specialised Android designers and developers for new software initiatives.” For a risk-free consultation, visit Codehesion’s website.
