Android Q is set to bring a selection of exciting new features, including a system-wide dark mode and improved control over app permissions. Other changes might not be so well-received however, such as the four commits made to Android’s Gerrit source code management this past weekend. These commits are all named “Carrier restriction enhancements for Android Q”, and include various changes to give network operators greater control over SIM locks. This allows carriers to restrict devices to only be used on their networks, a common practice in countries like the United States. Using Android Q, operators will also be able to lock multiple SIM slots – meaning owners will not be able to use a second SIM slot if they do not have the correct network’s SIM in the primary slot. This SIM lock will also remain in place if the device is factory reset.
