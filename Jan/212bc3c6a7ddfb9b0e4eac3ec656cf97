Canon executive Yoshiyuki Mizoguchi told Imaging Resource that a full-frame mirrorless camera capable of capturing 8K video is on its roadmap for the EOS R-series. “We are not just looking at video from a camera perspective, we are also working on how to make RF lenses better for video capture as well,” said Mizoguchi. He used the example of the RF 24-105mm F4L lens, which was its first L-series lens to use Nano USM technology. This technology is a fast linear actuator system, much like those found in the speedy AF motors that are found in some Sony lenses. “Paired with Dual Pixel CMOS AF, a wide range of Nano USM equipped RF lenses will promise video creators great image quality as well as impressive autofocus together in the R-series,” he added. Canon has previously been criticised for its implementation of 4K in its mirrorless cameras, with the company only managing to get this right last year. The current EOS R does shoot 4K video, but has been criticised due to the camera’s awkward 1.8x crop factor – which reportedly hinders a videographer’s ability to record wide shots.
