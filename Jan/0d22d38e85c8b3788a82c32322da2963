Rain users from across the country have complained of downtime on the network. MyBroadband readers started reporting Rain downtime from Wednesday morning at 08:00, with the first issues detected in the Western Cape. More reports then started to come in, with users stating that both fixed-LTE and mobile services were affected. Following the complaints, ISPs which sold the Rain fixed-LTE services issued status updates about the downtime. Afrihost said Rain informed it that there was a network issue affecting all Rain users. “Affected clients will have limited to no connectivity. Rains network engineers are urgently addressing the problem, and we are working closely with them to restore normal services as quickly as possible,” said Afrihost. Axxess posted a similar status message, saying that it has started to see clients coming back online. “There has seemed to be an issue with latching, with regards to mobile router please turn off at the wall/remove power, wait a minute, power back on,” said Axxess. At the time of writing, MyBroadband readers stated they were still experiencing problems with the Rain network. One user claimed he had suffered with no, or slow, connectivity for 40 hours – while another user stated he had been offline for 36 hours. Reports on Down Detector also show consistent issues affecting Rain users over the past 24 hours, with multiple reports of downtime on the network. It must be noted that certain users said when they changed their APN settings, their Rain service came back online. Rain told MyBroadband that it is having connectivity issues in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. “About 2% of users are affected, and we are working hard to resolve the fault – which we hope to do soon,” said Rain.
