Antivirus company Avast has released its 2019 PC report, which shows that outdated software is common among PC users. Data from over 163 million devices showed that 15% of Windows 7 users are still running the initial, unsupported RTM release from 2009. Additionally, 13% of all Windows 10 users aren’t running the latest version – instead running iterations such as Windows 10’s RTM release, or the Creators Update. Both of these versions are not supported by Microsoft, meaning that these computers are at risk. The report also showed that 15% of Microsoft Office users are still using Office 2007 – another piece of software that is no longer supported by Microsoft. The trend is even worse outside of Microsoft’s core software. According to Avast, 55% of all installed apps are not the latest versions. “While it might be okay to run older versions of some apps, crucial ones like browsers and email clients should always be updated to avoid potential security issues,” said Avast. “Another good example is VLC Player. With each new version, VLC introduces new features and bug fixes you don’t want to miss out on.” 94% of VLC Media Player and 85% of Mozilla Firefox users aren’t running the latest version of the respective apps. Mozilla Thunderbird, meanwhile, is not up to date on 60% of PCs.
