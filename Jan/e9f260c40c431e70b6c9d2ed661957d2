Google’s latest version of its Chrome browser, Chrome 72, is now available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. This follows yesterday’s release of Chrome 72 for Android. Chrome 72 will focus on stability and security, and will include a number of fixes and improvements. Beyond the increases in stability, Chrome 72 will implement a variety of back-end changes that are unlikely to be noticeable to the everyday user. These include the allowance of the declaration of public class fields in scripts and a user activation query API. This update will also remove HTTP-based public key pinning, as well as the rendering of FTP resources. The Chrome 72 update will roll out to users over the coming days.
