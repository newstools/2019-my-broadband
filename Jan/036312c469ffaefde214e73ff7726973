Gartner’s latest PC shipment estimates show that Lenovo is the most popular PC brand in the world, based on sales numbers. The latest figures from Gartner show that PC shipments dropped slightly in 2018, year-on-year, however. They also revealed that Lenovo, HP, and Dell accoundet for 60% of all PC shipments last year. “For the year, 2018 PC shipments surpassed 259.4 million units, a 1.3% decline from 2017,” said Gartner. “The majority of the PC shipment decline in 2018 was due to weak consumer PC shipments. Consumer shipments accounted for approximately 40% of PC shipments in 2018 compared with representing 49% of shipments in 2014.” “The market stabilisation in 2018 was attributed to consistent business PC growth, driven by Windows 10 upgrades.” The company stated that the top three vendors – Lenovo, HP, and Dell – boosted their share of the global PC market during the year. “Lenovo surpassed HP to move into the No. 1 position in the global PC market in the fourth quarter of 2018. A major factor for Lenovo’s share gain was credited to a joint venture with Fujitsu formed in May 2018.” “The company has recorded three consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year shipment growth, despite the stagnant overall market.” This saw Lenovo achieve an annual growth rate of 6.9% in 2018.
