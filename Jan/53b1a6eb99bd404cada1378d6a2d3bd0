SABC staff members did not receive their salaries today, which immediately caused speculation that the broadcaster had run out of money. There have been numerous reports that the SABC is in severe financial trouble and that it was almost of out of funds. When asked about why the SABC had not paid staff salaries, which were expected today, and if the broadcaster had run out of money, SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu dismissed the claims. Momodu said a technical error at their bank was to blame for employees not being paid and the SABC had not run out of money. The problem was expected to be resolved within the next few hours, added Momodu. “The payments have been made by the SABC to the banks and we expect employees to be paid on 29 January.” To see if Momodu and the SABC were telling the truth about the salary issue, MyBroadband contacted South Africa’s banks for feedback. Nedbank said the SABC’s January 2019 payroll “has been impacted due to the payment validation processes put in place between the SABC and Nedbank”. “This has now been finalised and salaries will be paid to SABC staff this afternoon, 29 January,” said Nedbank. Absa stated that “as a bank we don’t confirm who is or isn’t our client”. “I’m afraid this is not a matter we would comment on.”
