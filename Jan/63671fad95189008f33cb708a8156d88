Maria Ramos has stepped down as CEO of Absa Group and Absa Bank, the bank has announced. Ramos has been CEO of Absa for 10 years, and led the bank through the acquisition of Barclays Africa in 2013. She had wanted to step down earlier, but agreed to see the group through its separation negotiations with Barclays as well as the resulting “sell-down and key separation milestones,” which included Absa’s brand refresh. Ramos will officially retire in February when she turns 60. Absa announced the appointment of interim CEO René van Wyk, who has been an independent non-executive director on Absa’s board since February 2017. Van Wyk worked at Nedbank for 19 years, including as executive director of Risk for Nedcor Investment Bank. “The boards wish to thank Maria for a decade of dedicated service to our group and wish her all the best in her future endeavours,” said Absa.
