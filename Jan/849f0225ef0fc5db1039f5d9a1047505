YouTube has stated that it will increase its efforts to crack down on dangerous pranks and challenges. In a thread of tweets, the video platform reminded users of its content policies – stating that it prohibits content encouraging dangerous activities which may result in serious harm. The company also posted an update to its FAQ section outlining its policy towards dangerous pranks and challenges. “We’ve updated our external guidelines to make it clear that challenges like the Tide pod challenge or the Fire challenge, that can cause death and/or have caused death in some instances, have no place on YouTube,” the platform stated. YouTube added that its policies also extend to pranks with a perceived danger of serious physical injury. “We don’t allow pranks that make victims believe they’re in serious physical danger – for example, a home invasion prank or a drive-by shooting prank.” This follows the recent report of a US teen causing an accident on a highway after driving blindfolded as part of the Bird Box challenge.
