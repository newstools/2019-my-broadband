Ster-Kinekor hiked its movie ticket prices at the end of 2018 – its second set of wide-ranging pricing adjustment implemented in a year. While its first pricing adjustment around May was mostly below inflation, its subsequent increases raised prices at some cinemas by as much as 20%. Clients at Ster-Kinekor’s more affordable theatre complexes, such as Sterland and Maponya Mall, were hit with a double-whammy last year. They saw increases of between 8% and 10% in May, and this most recent increase saw their ticket prices shoot up by over 20%. Ster-Kinekor’s ticket prices vary by cinema complex, and the figures below show the prices of the most expensive and mid-tier theatres. While Ster-Kinekor no longer refers to its complexes as “Classic” and “Junction” cinemas, it remains a useful way to differentiate between the pricing tiers. “An annual price increase is normal for most companies operating within the entertainment and service industry sectors,” a Ster-Kinekor spokesperson previously told MyBroadband. “Like any business, supply and demand plays a role in how Ster-Kinekor determines which titles are scheduled at which sites, and what the ticket prices are at these sites. This exercise includes an audience analysis.” 2D and 3D movie prices across its theatres since 2005, plotted against inflation, are shown below.  Nu Metro did not increase its ticket prices recently, but a graph of its pricing adjustments against inflation over time is included below for the sake of comparison. The Nu Metro graph for 2D ticket prices shows how the brief price war between SA’s cinema chains affected increases between 2005 and 2007. Ster-Kinekor launched its cheaper Junction cinemas, where you bought a ticket but didn’t book a seat, and Nu Metro dropped its prices across the board to compete. Since then, Ster-Kinekor has stopped using the brand names “Classic” and “Junction”, though price differentiation between its theatres in different locations remains.
