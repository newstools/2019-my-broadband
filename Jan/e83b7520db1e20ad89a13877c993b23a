Many high-end smartphones are launching with cutting-edge features such as bezel-less displays, quad-camera systems, and in-screen fingerprint sensors. As these devices are expensive, their owners generally do their best to protect them by taking out insurance or buying a screen protector. A problem with in-screen fingerprint sensors, however – according to case manufacturer ArmadilloTek – is that they do not work properly when a screen protector is installed on the smartphone. In-screen fingerprint sensors are placed underneath the glass of a smartphone display, and the added thickness of a screen protector can prevent the sensor from picking up fingerprints correctly. ArmadilloTek said case manufacturers were working on addressing this issue by using new types of screen protectors, but noted that when new devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S10 ship, users will not be able to protect their device with a screen protector without compromising their in-screen fingerprint sensor. For now, the manufacturer said it would be shipping Galaxy S10 cases with no built-in screen protectors.
