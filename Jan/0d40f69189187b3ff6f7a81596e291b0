Criminals are wrecking mobile networks without any concern for the damage they cause and for leaving communities without communications services. Vodacom spokesperson Byron Kennedy previously said cellphone base stations are increasingly being targeted in South Africa. Criminals are after anything which can be sold, including diesel, batteries, copper, and telecoms equipment. These criminals rip base stations apart to get what they want, which means it takes a long time to repair the damage. “Each theft incident can severely impact the surrounding community, including businesses and students that rely on the Internet,” said Kennedy. “We repeatedly see situations where people can’t make emergency calls and sooner or later these criminals will cost someone’s life.” One expert said criminals are wrecking cellular base stations at a rate of around 60 sites per month, which makes it challenging to keep a network running.
