Curro Holdings has launched its new tech-focused schooling model, which is focused on Mathematics, Science, Robotics, and Coding. The company has also announced that the first school to use this model, Curro Foreshore, will be based in Cape Town and will open on 14 January 2019. “The idea behind this technology-driven, flexible approach comes from asking what skills learners will need for the 2030 workplace, and then working backwards to provide schooling that aims to teach those skills,” said Curro Foreshore executive head Ross Hill. “We are building on international best practice and introducing education approaches that are innovative within the South African context, while retaining some traditional teaching practices.” School days at Curro Foreshore will span from 8:00 to 17:30, and will ensure that learners do not need to complete homework. The classroom setup is designed to feel more like a modern coworking space than a traditional classroom, and while there are no sports facilities, the school will include “certain physical and cultural activities” within the school day. The school is open to girls and boys, and will only offer Grade 8 education this year – although it will progress with these students on their journey to writing the grade 12 NSC examinations. Curro Foreshore will cost R1,900 per month, and according to business manager Jay Paul, this takes into account all extra school-related costs usually paid over and above school fees. “Without sports fields and facilities, parents are not subsidising their maintenance and upkeep,” said Paul. “We supply a comprehensive stationery pack at the beginning of the school year, included in fees, along with the teaching material, textbooks, and software, which comes on the device that is also included.”
