Chinese smartphone company Meizu has unveiled its first smartphone without any physical ports, the Meizu Zero. The device sports an almost bezel-less display with an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and the only extrusions on the phone’s body are its front and rear-facing camera systems – which boast 20MP and dual 12MP + 20MP lenses respectively. As it does not have any ports, the device relies on 18W wireless charging, Bluetooth 5.0, and wireless connectivity which Meizu said will enable file transfers with speeds of a USB 3.0 wired connection. There are also no physical buttons on the device, but it does have pressure sensors with haptic feedback on its sides to replace traditional keys. The Meizu Zero has no SIM or microSD slot either, with the phone relying on eSIM technology to provide connectivity. Two tiny pinholes in the otherwise seamless chassis are for the microphone and for hard resets. Meizu’s new device will only be available in China at launch, and it may be limited to certain carriers due to its eSIM technology.
