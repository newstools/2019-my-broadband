Politico reports that Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has offered Tesla CEO Elon Musk permanent Chinese citizenship. On the Chinese government’s website, Musk is reported as saying that he loves China and wants “to come here more often”. “If you do, we can issue you a Chinese green card,” said Li. Musk and Li were meeting two days after Tesla’s new Giagfactory 3 production base – the first Tesla factory outside the USA – was launched in Shanghai. “We hope you can get a firm foothold and expand the market,” said Li to Musk, adding that he hoped Tesla could help open up China to international markets. The new Tesla factory took just three months to build, and Musk said he was impressed by how quick and efficient the process was. Musk expects the Tesla Model 3 to begin production at the new factory before the end of 2019.
