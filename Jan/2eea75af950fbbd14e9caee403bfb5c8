Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 will utilise reserved storage to ensure there is always sufficient disk space on a PC to perform critical Windows operations. Windows 10 will use this space to store files during Windows updates, ensuring that you donâ€™t run out of disk space. It will also be used to store temporary files by other important Windows apps and systems, and Windows will remove these files when they are no longer necessary. The goal of the new reserved disk space implementation is to ensure a more stable Windows experience, Microsoft said. Microsoft will reserve 7GB of storage space for this purpose, although this figure will vary in the future. Microsoft will allow users to reduce the amount of space reserved, but will not allow reserved storage to be disabled.
