While the department of education celebrates its 78.2% matric 2018 pass rate, the “real” pass rate for students from Grade 10 making it through matric must be examined. This is according to Nomsa Marchesi, the DA Shadow Minister of Basic Education. Marchesi said figures analysed by the DA show a massive dropout of students from Grade 10 to matric. Looking at the number of students who started Grade 10 in 2016 – who would become the matric class of 2018 – under 40% of these learners pass matric exams. “The real matric pass rate for each province reveals a devastating reality: only the Western Cape managed to keep over 65% of its 2016 Grade 10s in school and through to writing matric on time,” said Marchesi. “In Gauteng, 45% of its Grade 10s in 2016 didn’t write matric.” Marchesi added that the situation is particularly bad in the Free State, which has the highest dropout rate in the country. “The Free State has a well-known reputation for culling, or intentionally keeping back learners to inflate pass marks.” “A new worry is the Multiple Exam Opportunity (MEO), which some provinces have relied on more heavily than others. It is not clear how many of these learners will actually return to complete their exams in June 2019.” The “real” matric pass rate is similarly low when looking at the number of learners enrolled in Grade 1 in 2007 and those who passed matric in 2018 – coming in at a 40% pass mark.
