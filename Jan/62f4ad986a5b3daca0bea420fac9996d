The SABC has announced that it will not undertake the mass retrenchment process it outlined late last year. Previously, the company had planned to retrench up to 981 permanent employees and 1,200 of its 2,400 freelancers. The public broadcaster will not renew its notice to invoke section 189 of the Labour Relations Act in the interest of “the SABC, its employees, key stakeholders, and the South African public at large”. This decision follows a number of engagements between the SABC, its employees, and various stakeholders. The SABC acknowledged that it needs to review its increase in costs and conduct a thorough skills audit, the outcome of which will provide the broadcaster with a more defined structure and plan for the future. “This will ensure that the SABC meets its strategic objective of operating optimally and competitively in a digitised environment,” said the SABC. SABC management met with employees on 31 January 2019 to discuss the way forward.
