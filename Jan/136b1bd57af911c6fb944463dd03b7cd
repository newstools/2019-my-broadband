Rain customers suffered from network downtime today, according to reports received by MyBroadband. Local ISPs have also reported downtime on the Rain network. Afrihost said this morning that limited or no connectivity was affecting Rain clients. “We have been informed by Rain of a network issue affecting all Rain users. Affected clients will have limited to no connectivity,” said Afrihost. “Rain’s network engineers are urgently addressing the problem, and we are working closely with them to restore normal services as quickly as possible. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.” Webafrica and Axxess reported similar network issues on their respective status pages. Rain told MyBroadband that it experienced a fibre outage on one of its paths to its Cape Town core, which caused the network downtime. “This resulted in degraded Internet throughput for some users in the Cape only, between 02:00 and 8:30. The issue was resolved by shifting traffic to redundant infrastructure and full service was restored before 09:00.”
