Liquid Telecom is busy with the biggest network modernisation project the company has undertaken in over a decade. The network refresh, which started in August 2018, includes replacing aging infrastructure across its core and aggregation networks. Speaking to MyBroadband, Liquid Telecom CEO Reshaad Sha said most of this project is expected to be completed by April. The refreshed network will include a wide range of automated services and will enable the company to offer next-generation telecoms products to clients. The extent of the project means that there will be some network disruptions during the upgrade period, however. Sha explained that they are managing these disruptions and are working with their clients to minimise the impact on their businesses. While Liquid Telecomâ€™s network refresh project is behind certain network disruptions experienced by clients, the company has also been hit by two big fibre breaks in recent months. The first was caused by copper thieves who cut through and broke all conduits along a 2-kilometre stretch. This was along a major route for Liquid Telecom, which had a ripple effect on the systems used to re-route traffic. To restore this route new infrastructure had to be built, which took much longer than fixing a simple break. The second incident, which took place in late December, was caused by a burst water pipe in Randburg. The water utility provider dug up the pavement to install new pipes, which resulted in a big break along an important fibre route which connects two primary points-of-presence. This fibre break, which took a several days to fix, forced Liquid Telecom to move traffic to alternative routes. The photos below show the extent of the damage caused by the criminals and the water utility incident.
