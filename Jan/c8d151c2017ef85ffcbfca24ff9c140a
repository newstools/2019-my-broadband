Microsoft’s October 2018 Windows 10 update was put on hold a few days after release due to a bug that caused users to lose data. The update has since been fixed and is available – but Windows 10 users have been hesitant to update to this version of the operating system. According to data from AdDuplex, the Windows 10 October update is being used by just 12.4% of users. Users are continuing to use the previous April 2018 update instead, with 80.2% on this version of Windows 10. The uptake of the October 2018 version of Windows 10 is significantly less than any previous version of the operating system, added the report. “It clearly needs to accelerate in February or be scrapped altogether,” said AdDuplex.
