Oppo is set to launch a new smartphone on 16 January, and the device is rumoured to feature 10x optical zoom, according to GSMArena. A promotional image for the Oppo event includes a Chinese tagline which hints at the capability for 10x zoom on the upcoming device. According to the report, this 10x optical zoom feature will retain support for optical image stabilisation (OIS), but the technology may only be implemented on a prototype device instead of a consumer-ready smartphone. This is not the first time Oppo has explored adventurous camera solutions, with its Find X smartphone sporting a pop-up mechanical camera in an effort to provide a greater screen-to-body ratio while retaining high-end front-facing camera features. The Chinese manufacturer’s high-end smartphones have historically included flagship-grade specifications, including powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and AMOLED displays.
