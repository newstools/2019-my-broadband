Mint Group has launched a business IT survey which is aimed at gaining insight into the Microsoft software and cloud needs of South African businesses. The global Microsoft partner aims to shed light on the market’s current perception of Microsoft licensing, common challenges experienced, on-premise versus cloud investments, and the direction that South African organisations are taking regarding digital transformation. The survey results will be highlighted at the Cloud 101 event, which will take place at Microsoft’s head office in Johannesburg on 20 February 2019. The event will help organisations to navigate cloud licensing and investments, discuss audience questions via a panel of experts, and explain the different technology and licensing options for organisations according to their objectives. Cloud experts from both Microsoft and Mint Group will be available to collaborate and address attendee’s questions at the event. As a top 1% global systems integrator and a member of the Inner Circle for Microsoft Dynamics, Mint Group continuously analyses and addresses market needs to innovate next-generation technology solutions that help industries to disrupt and place people first. The company prides itself in digitally leading its clients through “customer centricity with Dynamics 365, Modern Minds with Office 365, Smarter Systems with Azure, and Intelligent Insights with Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Services in the digital space”. The Mint Management Technologies business IT survey will only take a minute to complete and you stand a chance to win a Xbox One 1TB Console – enabling you to watch 4K Blu-ray movies, stream 4K video on Netflix, and experience richer, more luminous colors in games and video.
