RS Components (RS), the trading brand of Electrocomponents plc (LSE: ECM), a global multi-channel distributor, today announced it is selling the recently launched Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (Intel NCS 2) – a highly affordable small and fanless computer-vision and deep-neural-network (DNN) accelerator. As well as for use by data scientists and academics, the device is ideal for a wide selection of developers and engineers looking at integrating computer-vision and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into their Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Available in the convenient USB form factor, the stick delivers high versatility for users, enabling deep-learning prototyping on a laptop or device with a USB interface.  Like its predecessor product – the Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick, which was launched in 2017 – the Intel NCS 2 is based on the Intel Movidius Vision Processing Unit (VPU). However, it deploys the latest version: the Intel Movidius Myriad X VPU, which has a dedicated hardware accelerator for DNN inference. The Intel NCS 2 also becomes a highly versatile prototyping and development tool when combined with the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit, which offers support for deep learning, computer vision and hardware acceleration to enable applications that have human-like vision capabilities. The combination of the Intel NCS 2 and the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit enables a fast development-to-deployment cycle: from prototyping trained DNNs on the compute stick to the easy porting of DNNs to an Intel Movidius VPU-based embedded device or system with minimal code changes required, if any. The Intel NCS 2 also provides support for the popular open-source Caffe and TensorFlow DNN software libraries. The Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 is now available from RS Components for delivery in South Africa and across Sub-Saharan Africa.  This article was published in partnership with RS Components.
