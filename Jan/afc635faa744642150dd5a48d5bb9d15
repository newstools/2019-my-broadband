AMD has issued a statement assuring gamers that there will not be a stock shortage of its upcoming Radeon VII graphics cards. Speaking to Overclock3D, AMD said that rumours circulating about its new graphics cards being in short supply were false and that it would have more than enough GPUs to meet the needs of customers. Previous reports alleged that AMD had fewer than 5,000 graphics cards and that the company would not be able to provide boards through AIB partners. AMD categorically denied these rumours, adding that it will make the GPUs available through its website and AIB partners on 7 February. “While we don’t report on production numbers externally, we will have products available via AIB partners and AMD.com at launch of Feb 7, and we expect Radeon VII supply to meet demand from gamers,” the company said. The Radeon VII graphics card aims to compete with Nvidia’s high-end products and is built on AMD’s 7nm Vega 20 microarchitecture.
