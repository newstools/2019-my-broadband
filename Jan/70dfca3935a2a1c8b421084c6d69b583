MyBroadband has strengthened its tech journalism team, with Jamie McKane being promoted to the position of senior journalist while Bradley Prior has joined the team as a journalist. Jamie has quickly risen up the ranks in the South African tech scene, and is an expert on a wide range of topics. This includes cryptocurrency, and Jamie pioneered MyBroadband’s reporting on Ethereum and Bitcoin – and the projects surrounding them – when many players in the industry were complete unknowns. His knowledge of PC hardware and systems has also proven to be invaluable, and he is the go-to guy in the office whenever someone needs advice about buying a new processor, graphics card, or monitor. Jamie holds a BA in English from Wits University, and is a self-taught techie with experience in coding and building tech solutions – including turning a Raspberry Pi into just about anything. Jamie’s love and knowledge of tech all stems from his involvement in PC gaming, and he prides himself on his near-pro Dota 2 and CS:GO skills. MyBroadband has also welcomed a new tech journalist to its ranks, Bradley Prior. Bradley has a BJourn from Rhodes University and, as you would expect, loves tech and is a PC gamer. Bradley has quickly proved himself a sharp tech journalist and immediately started covering events and big tech news stories after joining the team. His knowledge of tech is complemented by his excellent work ethic and attention to detail, and we expect great work from Bradley in the future. “Jamie’s promotion to senior journalist and Bradley joining the team will cement MyBroadband’s place as the biggest and best technology website in South Africa,” said MyBroadband Editor Kevin Lancaster. “Jamie and Bradley’s tech knowledge and journalism skills are a great asset to the company and I always look forward to reading what they serve up every day.”
