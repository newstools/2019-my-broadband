ICASA has announced it will hold public hearings on the draft of its International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) roadmap. The hearings will take place on 31 January and 1 February 2019 at ICASA’s head office in Centurion. In a media statement, ICASA said the draft roadmap, which was published on 9 November 2018, identifies the bands on which IMT will be deployed – and also identifies the migration of various current licences out of, or within, bands identified for IMT services. “For bands where costs and benefits of the migration were not straightforward, ICASA has conducted feasibility studies to determine the appropriateness of migration,” said ICASA Councillor Peter Zimri. ICASA has received 20 submissions regarding the public draft of its roadmap.
