Independent telecoms tower infrastructure company Helios Towers has signed an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in SA Towers. This marks Helios Towers’ first investment in South Africa following its partnership with Vulatel. SA Towers was founded in 2016 and has a strong relationship with all mobile network operators in South Africa. The company has built a pipeline of potential tower sites on more than 500 urban locations across the country. “This investment will accelerate Helios Towers’ entry into South Africa,” Helios Towers said. “As part of the agreement, the Group will invest into the platform and provide management expertise to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline.” The company said that SA Towers will be integrated into the Helios Towers organisation and manage South African tower operations, which Helios Towers plans to rapidly expand. “We are thrilled to announce this acquisition of SA Towers’ business, which will be made via our new partnership with Vulatel,” said Helios Towers CEO Kash Pandya. “We’re delighted to be partnering with an experienced and well-funded tower operator such as Helios Towers,” SA Towers director Rico Marx stated. “Together with the MNOs, whose relationships with SA Towers we value highly, we have ambitious expansion plans in order to meet the burgeoning demand for high quality tower infrastructure.”
