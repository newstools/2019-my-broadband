SanDisk has unveiled its latest prototype USB-C flash drive, which provides 4TB of storage space, at CES 2019. The 4TB USB-C Prototype will “demonstrate the world’s highest-capacity portable flash drive”, said the company. SanDisk did not reveal when the flash drive will be available to purchase or how much it will cost, however. It is not expected to be cheap, as SanDisk’s current USB-C flash drives sell for $32 (R440) for 128GB of storage. SanDisk said it will provide more information on the drive in the future.
