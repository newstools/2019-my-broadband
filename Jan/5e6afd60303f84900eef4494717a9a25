SABC staff members have not received their salaries, which has caused speculation that the broadcaster has run out of money. There have been widespread reports that the SABC is in severe financial trouble and that the coffers are expected to run dry soon. SABC spokesperson Neo Momodu dismissed these reports, however, saying a technical error at their bank was to blame for employees not being paid on 29 January as expected. She said the SABC has not run out of money, adding that the problem is expected to be resolved within the next few hours. “The payments have been made by the SABC to the banks and we expect employees to be paid on 29 January,” she said.
