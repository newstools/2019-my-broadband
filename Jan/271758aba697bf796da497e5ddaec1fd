Now that the cryptocurrency gold rush is over and there is once again a good supply of graphics cards in the South African market, building a gaming PC on a budget is a lot more realistic. The power of current-generation components means that you should be able to put together a machine that can handle any game at 1080p for an attractive price. Mid-range GPUs like the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 and Radeon RX 580 offer incredible performance for Full HD gaming while being priced very attractively. Buying a multi-core CPU which is good enough for gaming has also become cheaper of late. Thanks to the increased core counts of AMD’s Ryzen and Intel’s Core 9th-Gen chips, even low-end processors are more than suitable for most gamers. To determine how much a “budget” gaming PC costs in South Africa, we put together a build on paper comprising some of the best-value components available on the market. We used PassMark’s CPU and GPU value-to-performance rankings as a rough guide to select components for this build, although we also factored in South African pricing and product availability. This build includes components which are all compatible with each other, and omits higher-end components which are not strictly necessary for budget gaming but greatly improve the experience – such as a small SSD for the boot drive. Below is a component list for a budget gaming PC build with South African pricing.        The build is priced at well below R9,000 and will be able to handle any modern game at 1080p with no problems. It could benefit from a small SSD to act as the boot drive, but this would only affect load times and have a negligible impact on gaming performance. The AMD Ryzen 2200G chip included in this build offers four physical cores, a 3.7GHz turbo clock speed, and an integrated GPU, making it a great deal for its price. Similarly, the XFX Radeon RX 580 8GB is only R3,699 from Wootware and includes a choice of two free game codes for Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 5, or Tom Clancy’s The Division 2. The price of this build does not include the cost of a Full HD monitor or peripherals, however, but these can be relatively cheap purchases. For example, a 24-inch 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display is priced at around R2,000 from most retailers, and a Redragon mouse and keyboard combo costs less than R500. While being a budget machine, the power delivered by this rig is more than enough for gamers playing at 1080p, and owners should only need to upgrade hardware if they are moving up to a resolution of 1440p or 4K.
