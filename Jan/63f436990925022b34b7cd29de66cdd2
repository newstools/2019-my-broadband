MyBroadband has partnered with Vodacom Business to launch the South African Business Fibre Survey. The survey gathers information about the business connectivity market, like which connections businesses use and what speeds they receive. The survey also gives users the opportunity to say which aspects of a broadband service they find the most important â€“ speed, reliability, price, or support. The survey only takes a minute to complete and you stand a chance to win an Amazon Fire TV Cube and a Fire TV Stick. The winners will be announced next week.
