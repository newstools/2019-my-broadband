Softpedia News reports that Apple has filed a patent for the term iPod Touch that extends the device’s definition to cover “handheld game consoles.” Given recent rumours that Apple is working on a 7th-generation iPod, there could be something more to this patent than just protection against competitors, stated the report. Not much is known about the new iPod, but this patent could hint at Apple entering the handheld gaming space. Previously, the iPod Touch’s description had no reference to gaming, which is notable because previous versions if the iPod Touch have always been able to run games. If a new iPod Touch is going to be released in 2019, it is likely that it will come at an Apple event in the second quarter of 2019, added the report.
