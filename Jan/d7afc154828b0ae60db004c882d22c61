Google has won approval for a “radar-based motion sensing device” called Project Soli, Reuters reported. The FCC granted Google the approval to operate the device at power levels “higher than currently allowed”. Project Soli can also be operated on aeroplanes, it added. The device is intended to recognise hand gestures which can then be used to issue commands. “We’re creating a ubiquitous gesture interaction language that will allow people to control devices with a simple, universal set of gestures,” states the device’s product page. The reason for the FCC approval process was that Facebook raised concerns about the device “operating in the spectrum band at higher power levels”, said Reuters. Facebook has since retracted its concerns, following Google lowering the power levels from their original highs.
