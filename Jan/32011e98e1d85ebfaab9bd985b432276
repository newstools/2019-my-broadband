Rumours have spread that Twitter plans on treating all “learn to code” tweets targeted at journalists retrenched from publications such as BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post as abusive behaviour. Twitter told Reason that it won’t be blanket-banning everyone who publishes one of these tweets, however. “Twitter is responding to a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals – a policy that’s long been against the Twitter rules,” said a Twitter spokesperson. Jon Levine of The Wrap said that Twitter representatives previously told him the phrase “learn to code” automatically constituted abusive behaviour, but the company has since backtracked on this stance. The “learn to code” tweets come in the wake of BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti telling employees that the company would be cutting about 250 jobs, while Verizon – which owns The Huffington Post – said it would be cutting about 800 staff from its media unit.
