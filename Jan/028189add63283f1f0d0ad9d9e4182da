Ster-Kinekor has hiked its ticket prices significantly since last May, with movies at some theatres now 20% more expensive. Nu Metro has left its prices unchanged, although it previously implemented a stiff increase for its “Scene VIP” cinemas as well as cheaper theatres like Mountain Mill in Worcester. A 3D movie at one of Ster-Kinekor’s top-tier cinemas went from R98 to R107, and tickets for 2D shows went from R77 to R85. Ster-Kinekor also brought the disparate pricing of its various cineplexes inline with one another. Clients at CapeGate, Blue Route, and Bayside will now pay the same as at the majority of Ster-Kinekor’s high-end theatres such as Brooklyn. Similarly, the rest of the old “Junction” cinemas will now pay the same as Centurion and Northgate. It should be noted that Ster-Kinekor no longer uses “Classic” and “Junction” to differentiate between its cinemas, but they remain useful terms to help group the company’s pricing tiers. Signs bearing the terms may also still be seen outside malls around South Africa. Ster-Kinekor has also lined up the prices of Maponya, Parow, Promenade, and Newtown Junction with those of the slightly more expensive N1 City and South Gate. This resulted in an effective 20% price hike for customers. Prior to these price increases, Ster-Kinekor tickets were roughly the same price as shows in equivalent Nu Metro theatres. With these adjustments, Ster-Kinekor is the more expensive of the two. Ster-Kinekor previously told MyBroadband that annual price increases are normal for most companies operating within the entertainment and service industry sectors. It should also be noted that Nu Metro and Ster-Kinekor have loyalty and partner programmes that offer discounts on tickets. The changes to full ticket prices across the cinemas are summarised below. While Nu Metro has not increased its prices since May, its 2017/2018 adjustment is shown below for the sake of comparison.
