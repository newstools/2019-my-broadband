Kotaku reports that EA has cancelled its upcoming open-world Star Wars game. The game was originally announced in 2017, and was being developed at EA’s Vancouver office. Before this, the game was being developed by Visceral Games, but when EA closed the studio it took over the project. The project, which had the code name Orca, would allow the player to choose between playing as a bounty hunter or a scoundrel, and explore a variety of planets while working with different factions. According to Kotaku’s sources, EA decided that Orca was going to take too long to release. EA is reportedly now working on a less complex Star Wars game that is likely to release toward the end of 2020.
