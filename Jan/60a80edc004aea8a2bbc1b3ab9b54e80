Rain has told MyBroadband that it is currently running a number of eSIM devices on its mobile network, which are working “exceptionally well”. Rain CEO Willem Roos made the statement following questions about the network’s progress on eSIM support. Rain, Vodacom, and MTN told MyBroadband in September 2018 they were working with Apple to support eSIM technology in South Africa. This followed the launch of the iPhone Xs and Xs Max, which support eSIM functionality. The new iPhones feature dual-SIM functionality, with support for a physical SIM card and the inclusion of an eSIM – an embedded SIM card which is built into the device. Apple’s Dual-SIM Dual-Standby system – one physical nano-SIM and one eSIM – lets owners use cellphone numbers and mobile data services from two networks in the same iPhone. The eSIM, however, needs to be enabled by a mobile network to function as a second SIM. This requires networks to support the eSIM technology. Roos said that they are working to commercialise their eSIM offering in the first quarter of 2019. “We think our eSIM offering coupled with our R250 unlimited off-peak option will provide exceptional value for customers with devices – such as the iPhone Xs and Xr, and newer iPad – that are eSIM capable,” said Roos. “Using a low-end contract or pay-as-you-go SIM from one of our competitors for voice and coverage, and the Rain eSIM for data, will result in dramatic savings.” Roos said tests have shown that a Rain eSIM works well in smartphones, and using the iPhone Xs with a Rain eSim and standard Vodacom physical SIM produced good speed test results. An iPhone Xs accessing the Rain network using an eSIM achieved download speeds of over 99Mbps, upload speeds of over 11Mbps, and a ping of 59ms.
