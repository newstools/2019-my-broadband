The number of cord-cutters in the United States has grown by 48% over the past eight years, according to a report by Nielsen. The data showed that 16 million homes no longer have traditional satellite TV subscriptions, with 14% of all US households watching over-the-air TV. Nielsen found that cord-cutters are generally divided into two categories â€“ those who exclusively watch TV via their antenna and those who also subscribe to streaming services. The former camp comprises mostly older viewers with a median age of 55, while the second group has at least one subscription to a streaming platform such as Netflix. This group totals 9.4 million homes with a median age of 36, with these users being more active on social media. According to the study, cord-cutters still watch the majority of content on their TV, showing that while smartphones are being used increasingly frequently, big screens are still preferred for watching content at home.
