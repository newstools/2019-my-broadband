Analyst Lewis Ward believes that both Sony and Microsoft will unveil their next-generation consoles at E3 2020, before releasing them in 2021. Other analysts have speculated that Sony and Microsoft’s new gaming consoles would be announced at E3 2019, but Ward believes that hopeful gamers will have to wait. Talking to GamingBolt, Ward speculated that the 2019 E3 expo will instead be used to launch “modest hardware refreshes” for both consoles – as well as a variety of exclusive games. “If the plan is to give this assumed hardware refresh two years of runway before next-gen systems arrive, then 2020’s E3 is when Sony and Microsoft will be unveiling their new systems,” said Ward. He added that Sony or Microsoft wouldn’t put a new handheld console into the market, despite the success of Nintendo’s Switch. “I’m thinking PS5 and the next-gen Xbox won’t have built-in screens and will have disc drives.”
