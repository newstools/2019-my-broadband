Vodafone Group, which has a majority share in Vodacom, is suspending certain equipment purchases from Huawei in “another setback for the Chinese technology giant’s growth ambitions”. Speaking to Bloomberg, Vodafone CEO Nick Read said there is a lot of “noise” around governments banning Huawei network equipment and the facts need to be established. Vodafone is in talks with the company and various agencies and governments, following the pause on buying Huawei equipment for its core network. Read added that banning Huawei equipment from broadband networks would have an impact on operators and create a “significant delay” in rolling out 5G. The move follows continued pressure from the US to prevent the use of Huawei equipment in broadband and telecoms networks. MyBroadband contacted Vodacom to find out if the Vodafone “Huawei pause” will impact its operations and use of Huawei equipment, and the company provided the following statement: Against the backdrop of heightened political noise in Europe and wanting to make sure the industry is engaging in a fact-based discussion around this issue, Vodafone has decided to pause any new deployment of Huawei’s 5G equipment in its “core” in Europe.
