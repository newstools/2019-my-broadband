Samsung has announced its latest attempt at a powerful gaming laptop at CES 2019. Its new Notebook Odyssey will support Nvidia’s RTX 2080 graphics card, making it the first Samsung laptop to do so. The Odyssey will also offer users an Intel 8th-generation Core i7 CPU, as well as 16GB of RAM. It will include a 256GB SSD as well as a 1TB HDD, and users will also be able to add a second SSD to the Odyssey. The Odyssey sports a 15.6-inch, 1080p screen that offers gamers a 144Hz experience – and was designed with a single, central monitor hinge. No pricing is available for the Odyssey, although this should be available soon to coincide with its expected release in early 2019.
