Vodacom has announced that it will broadcast the 2018-19 FA Cup through its Video Play service. Vodacom users who have Video Play will be able to livestream games from 26 January until the final on 18 May. “Without the obligation of a monthly pay-TV subscription, Vodacom customers will have access to live, delayed-live, or catch-up to all their favourite teams in the FA Cup, including highlights and clips from as little as R35 a game from any device of their choice,” said Vodacom. “Full season tournament passes are also available for customers who want to watch more than just one game.” The company said this is a first in South Africa, in terms of the games being available on a pay-per-view basis. Vodacom’s Video Play service was launched six months ago, and has over 1 million subscribers, added the company. Besides sport, users can watch movies, series, music videos, and more. The Video Play pricing for the FA Cup is detailed in the table below. Video Play is available on Android and iOS, said Vodacom.
