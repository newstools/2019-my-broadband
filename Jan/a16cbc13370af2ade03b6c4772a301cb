Google’s Chrome browser is set to get a dark mode for Windows 10, according to a report by Hot Hardware. Chrome developer Peter Kasting has stated that a “native dark mode” is being developed and will initially be available for desktop users only. No date for the launch of the feature has been announced. This follows Google announcing plans to bring a dark mode to Chrome for Apple Mac and the macOS Mojave operating system. Dark modes for browsers and applications have proven popular of late, with macOS Mojave featuring a built-in dark mode which provides dark-themed interfaces in windows and apps. Apple said the reason for offering a dark mode is that it is “easy on your eyes and helps you focus on your work”.
