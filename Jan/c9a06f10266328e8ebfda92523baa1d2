The AA has commented on unaudited fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund, predicting that the petrol price will drop in February 2019. This change can be attributed to a lower average fuel price than and the strengthening rand, the AA said. “Although the international price of crude oil has ticked up since its low of 1 January, the overall price is still lower than December’s average, and this reflects in the current data,” the AA said. The AA said the current data showed a drop of around 12 cents a litre for petrol, 36 cents for diesel, and 33 cents for illuminating paraffin. It added that this figure may fluctuate in the second half of January, as the rand continues to improve slightly against the dollar. “Whether this will work in favour of fuel users or against them remains to be seen,” the AA said.
