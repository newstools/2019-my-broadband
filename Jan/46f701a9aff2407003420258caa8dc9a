Oledcomm has shown off its latest LiFi solution at CES 2019, called LiFiMax. The LiFi solution uses light to provide users with an Internet connection, and requires users to have an access point – which is mounted to an office or home ceiling – and a dongle attached to their laptop or other device. The LiFiMax solution provide a 100Mbps connection over 29 square metres and can handle up to 16 devices simultaneously. Oledcomm said that LiFi has multiple benefits over WiFi, including a more stable and faster connection, a secure channel for data, and a reduction in “electromagnetic pollution and interferences”. The LiFiMax package will sell for $900 and starts shipping in September 2019. For this price you will receive a transmitter and a dongle. This makes it substantially more expensive than Wi-Fi routers or mesh systems.
