The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) has launched the USB Type-C Authentication Program, which aims to stop security risks in USB chargers and devices. According to Engadget, the programme will define cryptographic-based authentication for USB-C devices and chargers. “Any host system using this protocol will be able to confirm the authenticity of a device or charger, including descriptors and capabilities, right at the moment a connection is made,” stated the report. This means that users can charge a device at a terminal, knowing that it is a certified charger. Policies could also be set for PCs to only access certain USB drives. The report added that the programme is not mandatory for companies at the moment.
