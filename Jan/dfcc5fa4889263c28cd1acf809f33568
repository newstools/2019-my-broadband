LG has unveiled its latest range of flagship TVs in the build-up to CES 2019. The devices feature ThinQ AI and are powered by the company’s Alpha 9 Gen 2 processor, which offer a “higher level of AI picture”. LG said a new deep learning algorithm has also been implemented in the TVs and this provides enhanced picture and sound via an analysis of the source content. The new processor builds on this by adjusting the tone mapping curve of the content a user is watching based on ambient conditions. An ambient light sensor measures light levels and automatically adjusts screen brightness accordingly. This includes support for HDR content. “LG’s 2019 TV range provides access to a wide selection of popular artificial intelligence services across multiple platforms, including Amazon Alexa in addition to the built-in Google Assistant,” added LG. Of the new TVs detailed by LG were the 88-inch 8K Z9 OLED and the 75-inch 8K LCD (Model SM99). The Z9 features the “most realistic 8K picture quality”, and will provide 8K upscaling and improved noise reduction. On the LCD side, the TVs will receive new branding – now called NanoCell TVs. The new LCD displays will provide colour accuracy in wide viewing angle and an ultra-narrow thin bezel, said LG. Another new feature on the TVs is the inclusion of HDMI 2.1 ports – fitted to all 2019 OLED models and selected NanoCell TVs. This adds support for content running at 120 frames per second for “better rendering of fast-action content such as sports and action movies”. Support for enhanced audio return channel – eARC – is another addition to the TV line-up, along with variable refresh rate support for gamers. No pricing or launch date was announced for the new TVs.
