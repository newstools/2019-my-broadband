The New York Times has said that it is becoming increasingly difficult for university students to be accepted into computer science courses, due to overwhelming demand. According to the report, the number of computer science majors in the US doubled between 2013 and 2017 – leaving computer science courses overpopulated. “The demand is unbounded,” said Don Fussell, University of Texas computer science department. According to Fussell, American universities are trying to hire additional staff in the computer science department to keep up. “I know of major departments that interviewed 40 candidates, and I don’t think they hired anybody,” he said. High-quality professors are in short supply because top undergraduates choose the lucrative private sector over continuing their studies.
