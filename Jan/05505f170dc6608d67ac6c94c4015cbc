A report published by Knight Frank has looked at possible transportation options to help link satellite towns and cities with more established ones. While motorways and rail will remain in the near future, Virgin’s Hyperloop One could be a consideration going forward. The Hyperloop was originally conceived to help travellers go between San Francisco and Los Angeles in half an hour. The train-like service would be “a cross between Concorde, a railgun, and an air hockey table”, and can travel at speed of 1,000km/h. According to Knight Frank, the Hyperloop could make travel between cities much quicker, while taking the pressure off roads. To see how fast the Hyperloop could be in South Africa, we compared its potential speed against the Gautrain – a popular alternative to driving between Johannesburg and Pretoria. The travel times for the Hyperloop were taken from its “route estimator” page. The results are shown below.
