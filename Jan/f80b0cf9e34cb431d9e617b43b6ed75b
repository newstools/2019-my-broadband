A new study by the Brookings Institute reports that about a quarter of all jobs in the US are at “high risk” of being replaced by automation. Jobs such as office administration, production, transportation, and food preparation – involving routine, physical labour, or information collection – are expected to be the hardest hit, with 70% of these jobs likely to be phased out in favour of automation. Lower risk jobs include those that require a high education level, as well as low-paying care and domestic service jobs. The report also found that rural communities are likely to be harder hit than urban ones, due in part to lower education levels. According to the report’s findings, “leaders need to initiate sustained efforts to ensure the labour market works tolerably for people in the AI era of automation”. It highlights that “what technology doesn’t replace, it complements” – adding that governments should invest in reskilling incumbent workers.
