Xiaomi vice president Wang Xiang has uploaded a video to Twitter showing off the company’s new double-folding smartphone. The Chinese manufacturer said the device is the world’s first double-folding smartphone, and the video showcases how the tablet-sized model can be changed to a more pocket-friendly form factor by folding in two sides. The video shows Xiaomi president Bin Lin using the smartphone and folding it in half. Once folded, the two panels on the back of the device are turned off, with the front display assuming a portrait orientation and a size similar to modern smartphones. A post on Lin’s Weibo account asks users for their feedback and suggests that the smartphone could be named the Xiaomi Dual Flex or the Xiaomi MIX Flex. Xiaomi’s new smartphone is currently still a prototype.
