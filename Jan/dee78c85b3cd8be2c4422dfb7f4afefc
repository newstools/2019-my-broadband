Microsoft’s general manager of product development, Mark Linton, told TechRadar that Microsoft expects the end of Windows 7 support to increase the adoption rate of Windows 10. “Windows 7 is going end of support in a year, and so customers are looking to move to make sure they get updated and so on,” said Linton. He also suggested that this expected uptake in Windows 10 is one of the major reasons for the variety of exciting new laptops released at CES 2019. Microsoft will stop providing updates for Windows 7 in January 2020. Windows 10 was available for free to all Windows 7 and Windows 8 users for a year following its release, but many stuck with the tried-and-tested reliability of Windows 7. Microsoft added that it has been working with laptop manufacturers to ensure their devices are optimised to work with Windows 10. “We’ve done a lot of work with our partners on the engineering side to get things like 32GB storage, to get updates working great, to get the driver model really smooth,” said Linton. “So, no matter what you spend, you’re going to have a great, reliable Windows 10 experience.”
