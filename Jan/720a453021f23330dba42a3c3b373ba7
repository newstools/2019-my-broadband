Narratiive has released its website traffic statistics for December 2018, which show that News24 is the largest South African website. Narratiive, formerly known as Effective Measure, is the official traffic measurement partner of the IAB South Africa and provides accurate traffic and demographics statistics for SA’s top websites. According to the statistics, News24 is the largest South African website – with 5.3 million unique browsers. Gumtree was ranked second with 4.3 million unique SA browsers, followed by IOL with 3.8 million browsers. Website traffic in December is lower than usual because of the holiday season when less people access the Internet from work. The table below shows the top websites in South Africa, based on unique South African browsers. Only IAB-affiliated websites running Narratiive’s tracking code are included in the table. A comprehensive look at South Africa’s websites and their visitor numbers is available here: South African Internet Map. The sites listed in the table above are only IAB-affiliated websites and exclude international sites, and many local ecommerce and company sites. To get an overview of the most popular websites visited by South African Internet users, Alexa can be used. It should be noted that Alexa’s data is not as accurate as Narratiive, however. The reason is simple – Narratiive uses tracking code to measure website visitors, while Alexa relies on panel-based data from its toolbar users to rank websites. Narratiive also provided an overview of the online behaviour in South Africa based on its December 2018 statistics.
