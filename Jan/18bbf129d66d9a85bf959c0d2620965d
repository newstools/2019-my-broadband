Microsoft is stepping up its efforts to fight fake news with the latest addition to its Edge mobile browser. When installing the Edge mobile browser on Android or iOS, the app now comes with NewsGuard pre-installed. NewsGuard is a fake news detector which can be toggled on in the browser’s settings menu, after which it will notify users whether the website they are reading is a credible source of news. The platform focuses mainly on US websites, but also displays information for many international news platforms. NewsGuard includes a “Nutrition Label” for major US websites, analysing the website’s agenda and rating it according to criteria, including false content publishing, error correction, differentiation between news and opinion, and avoidance of deceptive headlines. While NewsGuard comes pre-installed on Microsoft Edge for mobile, it is also available as an extension for Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
