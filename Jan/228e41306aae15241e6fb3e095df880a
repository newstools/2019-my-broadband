Vox has announced a new partnership with Netstream and SA Digital Villages (SADV) to increase the reach of its fibre-to-the-home products. Vox is partnering with Netstream and SADV to get customers connected quicker, while simultaneously expanding its network coverage beyond core areas. “We want to position ourselves as the Internet service provider of choice for FTTH and the best way to do this is by extending our reach in the consumer market,” said senior product manager at Vox, Claire Williamson. Fibre connectivity is available through SADV in certain areas of Gauteng, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, and the North West, while Netstream offers services in Gauteng and the Western Cape. “Combined, they will provide access to 50,000 additional ‘live’ homes, with around another 40,000 to go live over the course of 2019,” said Vox. Williamson said that the ability to reach new areas was a major consideration when choosing to partner with these networks. “What is also important is that they have some level of automation, such as an online ordering portal or interface that will help us to effectively manage and deliver the service to our customers,” added Williamson. Customers who use the Netstream or SADV networks through Vox will have access to a range of product options, ranging from 4Mbps to 100Mbps. These products can be found below. For Netstream, there is an installation fee of R1,725. For SADV, there is an installation fee of either R999 or R1,725, depending on the user’s dwelling type.
