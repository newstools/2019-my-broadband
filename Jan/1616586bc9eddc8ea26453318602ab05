Poynting has announced its new PUCK antenna range for use in the IoT, M2M, Smart Meter, Smart Utilities, and transportation markets. The flagship 5-in-1 antenna offers 2×2 MIMO LTE and Wi-Fi in a dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz configuration, along with GPS and GLONASS. The range also includes a Wi-Fi-only variant, as well as a GPS and GLONASS-only variant called the GPS-1-V2. The PUCK antenna range is both Wi-Fi 6 and 5G ready and covers the popular international LTE bands. A variety of mounting options are included, including 40mm and 80mm spigot mounts, vertical pole mounts, horizontal pole mounts, and wall mounts. “The radiation patterns of all elements provide an excellent balance between omnidirectionality, pattern diversity and good radiation abilities at the desired elevation, which is often overlooked in such a small size antenna.” said Stephen Froneman, product manager at Poynting Group. Poynting said this antenna exceeds the performance of many competitor products which are similarly sized, especially at the higher frequency bands where performance is critical for LTE.
