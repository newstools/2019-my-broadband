WhatsApp Business for desktop and web is getting a collection of new features, according to a blog post on the company’s website. These new features have previously only been available on the mobile version of the app, but will now be accessible to desktop users. The new functionality includes quick replies, which allow you to automate answers to common questions. Additionally, WhatsApp Business users on desktop and web platforms can now also use chat list filtering and labels to manage contacts and sort chats by unread messages, groups, or broadcast lists. “Using these features on a computer helps businesses save time and get back to their customers quickly,” WhatsApp said. “We’re excited to keep growing WhatsApp Business and introducing new features that make it easy for customers to find and engage with businesses that are important to them.” It has been a year since WhatsApp Business was launched, and more than five million businesses have already signed up and are using the platform.
