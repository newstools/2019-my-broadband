Following AMD launching its latest graphics card for gaming, the Radeon VII, Nvidia has hit back. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the new AMD card was “underwhelming” and stated that their GeForce GTX 2080 would crush the Radeon VII in benchmarks. “The performance is lousy,” said Huang, speaking to Gizmodo. The report stated that AMD CEO Lisa Su responded to Huang’s comment by saying “I would probably suggest he hasn’t seen it” – referring the to the Radeon VII. At the launch of the Radeon VII, AMD said it was the most high-performance GPU it has launched to date. “It provides seamless, high-refresh gaming at 1080p, ultrawide 1440p, and 4K,” said AMD.
