Password sharing for streaming services like Netflix and HBO are such a significant problem that the UK-based Synamedia has developed a new service to curb this practice. Synamedia’s Credentials Sharing Insight helps streaming service providers to combat the rapid rise in account sharing between friends and family. Using AI, behavioral analytics, and machine learning, Synamedia Credentials Sharing Insight identifies, monitors, and analyses credentials-sharing activity across streaming accounts. The solution can also be used to detect and shut down large-scale, for-profit credentials sharing accounts run by fraudsters. While this solution can be attractive to international streaming companies, MultiChoice Connected Video said it has no plans to implement such a system. Richard Boorman, communications head at Connected Video, told MyBroadband that while they keep an eye on password sharing, it is not a major concern at present. Connected Video oversees development of Showmax and DStv Now in South Africa. DStv Now and Showmax currently allow people to watch two concurrent streams per account, which Boorman said helps subscribers to “get the most from these services”. “It’s a really convenient way to watch on additional TVs around the house, as well as on multiple tablets and smartphones,” Boorman said.
