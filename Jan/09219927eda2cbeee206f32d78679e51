President Cyril Ramaphosa said South Africa needs to work harder to improve efficiency in key subjects, especially in early schooling. Ramaphosa made the statement at the Basic Education Department’s Lekgotla in Boksburg on 21 January, where he called on the basic education sector to focus on a number of critical areas – which include: “It is at the basic level of education where we must inculcate and embed the culture of learning; where we must produce children who are obsessed with consuming existing knowledge and create a burning desire among them to produce new knowledge,” said Ramaphosa. The president said by preparing children to excel from an early age, especially in the priority areas of science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics, they will be better prepared for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Ramaphosa also called on the basic education sector to promote flexible learning pathways that ease the transition between all educational levels. The president highlighted a General Education Certificate (GEC) at a level below Grade 12 as one change which is likely to greatly facilitate the pathways between schools and colleges. “Apart from facilitating the transition from school to college, a GEC would address the current problem of hundreds of thousands of young people leaving education completely each year, with no national qualification with which to navigate the labour market,” said Ramaphosa. While no indication was provided as to when this change could be made, it appears that the idea has officially been mooted. Speaking to Parent24 in November 2018, the Western Cape Education Department’s director of communication, Paddy Attwell, said that the idea is being considered by the government. “The national Department of Education is considering a General Education and Training Certificate, but the matter is still under discussion,” he said.
