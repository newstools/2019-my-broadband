The ANC has lost its bid to have the domain name of its original website returned. The South African Institute of Intellectual Property Law (SAIIPL) has ruled against the party on its dispute against Unwembi Communications. Unwembi Communications has been battling with the ANC for months over the nonpayment of hosting and development fees for the party’s website. The company is suing the party for R32 million over the payment dispute, while the ANC has been trying to regain control over its original “anc.org.za” domain name. To combat this, the ANC recently announced the launch of a new official website – www.anc1912.org.za – after its website at “anc.org.za” was taken offline by Unwembi Communications. In the SAIIPL judgement, the adjudicator expressed discontent with the behaviour of both parties, but found that the ANC’s bid to have its domain returned to it was not backed up by sufficient evidence. The contractual dispensation between the parties is now the subject of High Court proceedings, and the adjudicator believes it unnecessary and unwise to express any opinion on the merits of this contractual dispute, the judgement stated.
