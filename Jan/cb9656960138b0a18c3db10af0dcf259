Intel has revealed it latest storage device at CES 2019, the Optane Memory H10 module. The module is an M.2 SSD drive which includes Intel Optane memory and QLC 3D NAND storage. Three versions of the module were shown by Intel (Optane + Storage): The aim of combining the Optane memory with SSD storage is that the Optane memory provide super-fast loading and search functionality, while the SSD portion stores your files and programmes. The Optane memory does this by working in conjunction with the storage portion it is linked to in the module, said Intel. No pricing for the modules were detailed, but they are expected to launch later this year.
