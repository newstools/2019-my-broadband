Cell C’s streaming service Black has announced that it will offer prospective subscribers a 7-day free trial of “Binge Elite” – Black’s premium subscription package. Previously, Black’s free trial only covered its entry-level package, Binge Select, although this trial was available for 30 days. “We are offering consumers the opportunity to trial the service before committing to a daily, weekly, or even monthly package,” said Black PR manager Precious Nkabinde. “This is a fantastic way to keep the budget in check, while reviewing the content on the platform to see if it meets expectations.” You do not need to enter your payment details when signing up for this free trial, ensuring that you can’t be billed should you forget to cancel. Binge Elite usually costs R449 per month and offers access to international and local movies, series, music, TV shows, and documentaries, as well as over 60 TV channels.
