According to TheNextWeb, Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara said Apple engineers are working on transitioning their new devices onto USB-C technology. Mac Otakara added that this move would not be limited to iPhones – iPads would also get the new connection. Apple’s engineering team has not progressed to the reference design stage yet, however. This means that the tech giant could fail to launch the new technology this year, instead releasing their devices with USB-C from 2020. Mac Otakara also reports that Apple is looking into creating a new iPod, targeted primarily at gym-goers and sportspeople. The last iPod devices were produced in 2017, although the Touch was launched in 2015.
