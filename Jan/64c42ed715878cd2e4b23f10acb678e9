Slightly Mad Studios CEO Ian Bell has stated on Twitter that they are building the “most powerful console ever”. The studio behind Project Cars said “The Mad Box” console will deliver 4K visuals and high-performance VR to users. “You want a full engine for free to develop your games on it? You have it,” added Bell. Bell later added that he expected the console to ship in three years’ time. The specifications of the console will be “equivalent to a very fast PC two years from now”, he added. Besides gaming PCs, the most powerful gaming consoles on the market currently are the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X.
