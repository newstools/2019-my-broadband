Netflix has announced that it gained 8.8 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2018, exceeding its predicted number of 7.6 million new subscribers. Of these, 1.5 million were from the US, while the remaining 7.3 million subscribers were from the rest of the world. Netflix boasted a total of 139 million subscribers at the end of 2018 – 29 million more users than it had at the end of 2017. Netflix also announced that they saw a 35% increase in revenue year-on-year, reaching a total of $16 billion for 2018. However, the company’s fourth quarter operating margin dipped from 7.5% to 5.2%, which Netflix put down to their launching of more titles in this period. Netflix added that their new original movie, Bird Box, was likely to be viewed in over 80 million households. The company also highlighted that they are currently competing more with video games like Fortnite than with television companies such as HBO for user screen time.
