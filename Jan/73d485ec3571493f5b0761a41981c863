Alienware has launched what it calls the world’s most powerful gaming laptop, the Area 51m. The laptop features the company’s new “Legend” design and introduces a range of firsts for Alienware devices. “The reimagined Area 51m is the most powerful, upgradeable gaming laptop ever conceived. It marks the first and only laptop with a 9th-gen 8-core desktop processors, 64GB of memory, 2.5Gbps Ethernet technology, and upgradeable graphics and desktop processors,” said Alienware. The device also packs a 17-inch full HD 144Hz display with a narrow bezel, and “cutting-edge thermal and cooling technology”. This provides 50% more performance and 32% less volume than its predecessor. The standout feature of the Area 51m is its upgradability, letting users change their CPU and GPU. “CPU upgrades can be done using standard desktop-class processors, while GPU upgrades can be done via onboard graphics module replacement or with the Alienware Graphics Amplifier,” said the company. This let Alienware fit an Intel Core i9-9900K into the machine, which is enabled with up to 125% rated power for high-end overclocking. Users can also get up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 for graphics processing. Alienware said the Area 51m will be available from 29 January, starting at $2,549.
