Cell C announced it has extended its free data promotion for its Black streaming service until the end of June 2019. The free data can be accessed by Cell C prepaid and contract customers, and can be used to watch or download content on the Black platform. “For most consumers, the new year brings added expenses and we have decided to extend the promotional period to the end of June 2019 to ensure Cell C customers continue to watch their favourite series and movies without incurring additional data costs”, said Black. Black also recently launched a free seven-day trial for its Binge Elite package, which allows users to try out the highest subscription tier on Black. The streaming service is available on all networks in South Africa and each subscription can be accessed on up to five devices.
