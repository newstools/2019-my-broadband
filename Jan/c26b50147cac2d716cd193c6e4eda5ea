The majority of Netflix subscribers would stop watching content on the platform if the streaming service introduces adverts, according to a study by Audience Project. The study surveyed Netflix subscribers across Europe and the United States, and found that over half of users would stop watching content on Netflix if advertisements were implemented on the platform. 54% of subscribers in the United States said they would stop watching Netflix content, with 57% of UK subscribers sharing this sentiment. Subscribers in Denmark were the most skeptical of adverts, with 69% of surveyed users stating they would stop watching Netflix if it started showing adverts. The survey also asked users if they would stop using the platform if Netflix introduced adverts while lowering the subscription price. In most countries, around half of all subscribers would still stop watching content on the platform if this change was implemented. The Audience Projectâ€™s study was based on more than 16,000 survey respondents across seven countries: the United States, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.
