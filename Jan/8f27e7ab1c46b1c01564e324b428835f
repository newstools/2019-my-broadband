Curro recently launched its newest school, Curro Foreshore, which is the first school to be based on its new tech-focused model. This model is focused on Mathematics, Science, Robotics, and Coding – skills Curro believes will become increasingly important in the workplace moving forward. “We are building on international best practice and introducing education approaches that are innovative within the South African context, while retaining some traditional teaching practices,” said Curro Foreshore executive head Ross Hill. The school is situated near the Cape Town city centre, and its classroom set-up is designed to feel more like a modern coworking space than a traditional classroom. There are also no sports facilities, but the school will include “certain physical and cultural activities” within the school day. The school day is also different to most schools, and will span from 8:00 to 17:30 – with students not needing to complete any homework outside of these hours. School fees amount to R1,900 per month, according to business manager Jay Paul, and include all school-related costs. Paul said that Curro Foreshore’s fees are so reasonably priced because the school does not need to pay for the upkeep of sports fields and facilities. Curro’s Foreshore school opened today, 14 January 2018, and welcomed its first students – who consist only of Grade 8 learners. As these students progress up the grades, the school will expand to cater for them – meaning that the school will offer Grade 8 through to matric by 2023. To show off the launch, Curro published photographs of its facilities on its Facebook page. These photographs are shown below.
