Intel plans to launch a new high-end desktop processor which will only be available through a closed online auction, according to documents seen by AnandTech. The processor is named the Intel Core i9-9990XE and will only be sold to system builders through the auction – meaning it will not be available to the general public. While this chip will be the highest-numbered CPU in Intel’s desktop line-up, it only features 14 cores compared to the 18 cores of the Core i9-9980XE and is built on the manufacturer’s Skylake architecture. According to the report, Intel will hold a series of auctions where it will offer the chip to OEMs. Only three companies are attending the preliminary auction. This processor boasts a TDP and clock speed of 255W and up to 5GHz respectively, making it a great chip for high-end systems with X299 chipsets. These specifications mean the new chip is essentially a highly-binned and overclocked version of Intel’s Core i9-9940X processor.
