Leaks by Ben Geskin and Gregory Blake show a cryptocurrency wallet in Samsung’s Galaxy S10. In the leaked images, this wallet is called the Samsung Blockchain KeyStore and labels itself as “a secure and convenient place for your cryptocurrency”. Users will be able to either import cryptocurrency from another wallet, or start their own wallet from within the app. The app is included under the “Biometrics and security” system menu, which suggests that the Samsung Blockchain KeyStore will come with the S10 by default. In the leaked photos, the wallet only supports Ethereum – and it is unknown whether the wallet will support more cryptocurrencies at launch. Samsung will unveil its Galaxy S10 range on 20 February, while sales are expected to begin on 8 March.
