Samsung announced that it has begun mass producing the world’s first 1TB flash storage chip for smartphones. This 1TB embedded Universal Flash Storage (eUFS) will allow smartphones to offer 1TB of internal storage space without the need for expandable microSD storage. “The 1TB eUFS is expected to play a critical role in bringing a more notebook-like user experience to the next generation of mobile devices,” said Samsung. “What’s more, Samsung is committed to assuring the most reliable supply chain and adequate production quantities to support the timely launches of upcoming flagship smartphones in accelerating growth of the global mobile market.” This new flash storage chip has the same package size as the previous-generation 512GB solution, using Samsung’s 512-gigabit V-NAND flash memory to deliver more capacity in the same form factor. Samsung said its 1TB flash storage will also support file transfer speeds of up to 1GB/s. The company plans to expand the production of its new flash storage chips throughout the first half of 2019 to meet the demand from manufacturers.
