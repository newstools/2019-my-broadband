NPD Group has released its sales data for 2018 which shows that the Nintendo Switch was the top-selling console in the US – both in terms of revenue and units sold. The success of the Switch comes primarily off the back of a successful December, in which the device earned the most sales for any console since the Nintendo Wii’s great performance in 2009. Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. Ultimate also outsold the series’ previous iteration, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, by 70% for the year. The top-selling game of 2018 was Red Dead Redemption 2, followed by Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and NBA 2K19. Consumer spending in the gaming reached $43.4 billion in the US – an increase of 18% – including record growth in both hardware and software sales.
