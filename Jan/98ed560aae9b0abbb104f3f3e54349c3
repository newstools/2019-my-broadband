ICASA has announced that it is looking for a service provider to deliver a new network performance monitoring system. This will allow it to improve its monitoring of South Africa’s mobile networks, checking the quality of the services they provide. At the moment, ICASA uses a drive-test methodology to track the quality of service offered by South Africa’s mobile networks. ICASA wants to add a passive network performance monitoring system so they can track these networks continuously, rather than just in individual bursts. Current KPIs that ICASA can track are also limited to accessibility for voice calls and ability to retain calls. The new technology will allow ICASA to track various additional KPIs, including data service availability, call drop ratios, and the time it takes for calls to connect.
