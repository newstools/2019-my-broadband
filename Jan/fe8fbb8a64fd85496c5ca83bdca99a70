TechRadar has reported the latest rumours it has picked up about the iPhone “11”. The report stated that the next edition of the iPhone will have a “significantly better” front-facing camera – coming in at 10MP. The front camera in the latest iPhone Xs and Xr models are 7MP units. The upgrade could improve Face ID and Animoji usage, added the reprot. On the rear, a triple-lens camera system is expected, with two of the lenses set to be 10MP and 14MP sensors. While there have been reports that Apple will drop its Lightning port in favour of USB-C on new devices, the iPhone “11” is set to keep its Lightning port. Apple is expected to launch its new range of iPhones in September 2019.
