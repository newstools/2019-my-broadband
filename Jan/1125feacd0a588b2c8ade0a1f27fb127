Vodacom shut down its headquarters and Vodacom World mall this morning ahead of protest action around the Please Call Me debacle. Most Vodacom staff were told to stay at home today, while the few staff members at the office had entered from a side gate. Protesters have since gathered outside Vodacom World demanding that the company pay Kenneth Makate R70 billion for his involvement in the company’s Please Call Me service. Vodacom said in a statement that it has fully complied with a Constitutional Court order instructing it to compensate Makate, and is ready and willing to pay him a substantial amount. The company has reportedly offered Makate R49 million, but Makate refused Vodacom’s offer. A police presence surrounded the Vodacom World campus as protests took place today, with supporters of the movement singing and waving banners. Photos of the protest at Vodacom World are below.
