ICASA has announced that it will hold public hearings on feedback it has received on its role and responsibilities in the regulation of cybersecurity. This follows the publication of a discussion document on the matter, and 13 subsequent submissions from interested stakeholders. The public hearings will be held from 17-18 January 2019 at ICASA’s offices. Respondents include MTN, Cell C, Vodacom, and Research ICT Africa. “The publication of the discussion document was perpetuated by the proliferation of Internet interconnections and increased data services that have led to a significant growth of cyberattack incidents often with disastrous consequences,” said ICASA.
