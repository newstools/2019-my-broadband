MTN announced that it has cut its out-of-bundle data rate by up to 75% for prepaid customers. The operator said prepaid customers not making use of data bundles will only pay R0.29 per MB for data usage, while customers who purchase data bundles will now pay R0.49 per MB for out-of-bundle usage. “We have consistently been reducing the cost to communicate in recent years, but we want to do more for our customers by tackling the issue of OOB pricing,” said MTN SA CEO Godfrey Motsa. “We know we are addressing a real pain point for the millions of South Africans that support MTN.” Due to the size of MTN’s subscriber base, this pricing change will be rolled out to all prepaid customers over a seven-day period, starting on 31 January, the company said. MTN added that it would also double the value of selected prepaid voice and data bundles for the next two months. These bundles are available through the *142# USSD menu and are tailored for each customer.
