President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the digital economy summit at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand on 5 July 2019. At the same time, his address will be broadcast live as a hologram to the Rustenburg Civic Centre, the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS) said. “This will be the first live holographic broadcast of a Head of State, thus showcasing South Africa’s readiness to be a leader in the 4IR,” the presidency stated. “As the summit’s opening ceremony commences at Gallagher Estate in Midrand wherein President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to deliver the opening keynote address, a real-time simulation led by the Premier, Prof. Job Mokgoro will take place at the Rustenburg Civic Centre.” A 3D hologram is a projection that exists freely in space and is visible without the need for 3D glasses, the DTPS said. “It displays products, objects, and animated sequences three-dimensionally and enables seemingly real objects or animations to appear to float completely freely in space.” “This method of using a 3D hologram opens up a completely new, revolutionary way of presenting products,” the Department added.
