Vodacom recently launched a new “Red Hot Deal” promotion, offering big discounts on 10GB, 20GB and 60GB mobile data bundles. Vodacom cut the price of its 10GB anytime data with 10GB Night Owl data bundle from R299 to R149 per month. It also cut the price of its 20GB anytime data and 20GB Night Owl data by half – down from the usual R399 to R199 per month. This is, however, not the only big data deal available to South Africans. MTN is offering its customers 20GB anytime data and 20GB Night Express data for R199. MTN also sweetens its deal by throwing in an additional 20GB anytime data and a free 14GB Entertainment Pass for the first month. The table below compares the price of large mobile data bundles from South Africa’s large mobile operators. It should be noted that these are only 24-month contract prices and do not include once-off or prepaid bundles.
