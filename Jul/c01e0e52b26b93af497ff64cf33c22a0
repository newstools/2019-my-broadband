Microsoft has begun showing notifications which warn Windows 10 users if their operating system build is nearing end-of-life, Windows Latest reports. The company has previously displayed notifications warning of OS build expiry on older versions of its operating system, but it has now begun alerting Windows 10 users if they are using an outdated version of the software. Windows 10 users who are still using the April 2018 build will begin receiving warnings in the Windows Update application stating that their OS version will expire later this year. These alerts ask users to update to a newer release of the operating system to continue receiving security updates and new features. “You’re currently running a version of Windows that’s nearing the end of support. We recommend you update to the most recent version of Windows 10 now to get the latest features and security improvements,” the notification states.
