Developers at XDA have released an unofficial version of Android for Nintendo’s portable Switch gaming console. This version of the Android 8.1-based Lineage OS 15.1 mimics the Nvidia Shield TV software and supports both handheld and docked modes. A number of bugs still exist within the code, such as problems with auto-rotation and battery life, but the software includes support for standard Android applications including web browsing, dedicated applications, and support for Nvidia Shield-exclusive titles such as Borderlands and Half-Life 2. It is important to note that this Android operating system may not be compatible with all versions of the console, and the installation of the software could compromise support for standard Switch games in some situations. Users can install the software by etching the system image onto their SD card along with the GApps suite and custom “Shield-ifier” software. Updates for this custom Android ROM will be released via flashable zip files and will need to be manually installed in the same manner.
