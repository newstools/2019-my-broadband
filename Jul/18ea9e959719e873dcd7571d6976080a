Microsoft South Africa has announced that Office 365 cloud services are now available from its local data centre regions, delivering improved productivity and latency to customers. “Delivering the richest Office experiences from the newly available Microsoft datacentre regions in South Africa is the next step in our journey of partnering with businesses to empower them to do and achieve more, with the security of their data being top of mind,” said Microsoft South Africa managing director Lillian Barnard. This move helps customers to meet their data residency requirements by allowing them to comply with local regulations and privacy standards. Customers who are already using Office 365 will not be affected by the change in geography and will continue to enjoy the same experience. Microsoft said clients including Altron and the Gauteng Provincial Government have used Office 365 to developer their workplaces, and the addition of local Office 365 services will allow them to progress further towards digital transformation. The company added that it would make its Dynamics 365 and Power Platform services available in South Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019. “We are committed to accelerating digital transformation across the continent and we have seen already seen a tangible difference since we opened Africa’s first hyper-scale datacentres in South Africa earlier this year,” said Barnard.
