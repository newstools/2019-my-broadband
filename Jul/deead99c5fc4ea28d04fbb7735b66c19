Open-source emulator launcher application RetroArch will launch on Steam on 30 July 2019, making it the biggest non-commercial emulation launch on Valve’s online store. RetroArch is not technically an emulator itself, but instead provides a platform for users to download and install emulators at the tap of a button. The program supports various emulators, including PlayStation 2, PSP, Nintendo SNES, and Game Boy consoles, all of which can be accessed through RetroArch’s “Load Core” menu. While the platform is listed on Steam with a release date, there is still some uncertainty regarding Valve’s stance towards emulators and the potential piracy involved. “While there is nothing particular about RetroArch or the Libretro API that has anything to do with emulators, most do it use it for this purpose,” RetroArch developer Libretro stated in its Steam listing. The developer said the Steam version of RetroArch would be identical to the standalone programme available from the developer’s website at launch, but Steamworks SDK functionality could be added after to launch to enable addition Steam features.
