At the 2019 AWS Summit in Cape Town, Amazon showed off its impressive AWS DeepRacer vehicle. The AWS DeepRacer is a 1:18-scale race car which is driven by reinforcement learning (RL), and is seen by AWS as an entry point into understanding this technology. RL is an advanced form of machine learning which allows for the learning of complex behaviour without any defined training data. Instead, the vehicle uses a camera to view the track and implements a reinforcement model to power the throttle and steering. While Amazon offers a cloud-based 3D racing simulator for those who want to test out the technology, at the 2019 AWS Summit, Amazon showcased a real-life version of the vehicle and challenged attendees to put themselves to the test. As part of its efforts to drive interest in RL, AWS also runs the AWS DeepRacer League, which allows users to submit their lap times and see how they stack up against other racers. AWS DeepRacer vehicles are available for pre-order online. Specifications and photos of the DeepRacer vehicle are below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-313115 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DeepRacer-Headline.png" alt="DeepRacer Headline" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DeepRacer-Headline.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DeepRacer-Headline-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DeepRacer-Headline-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313107" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-3-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-3-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-3-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-3-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-3-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313111" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-5-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-5-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-5-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-5-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-5.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313113" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepracer-1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepracer-1-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepracer-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepracer-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepracer-1-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepracer-1-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deepracer-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313105" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-2-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-2-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-2-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-2-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-2.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313109" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-4-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-4-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-4-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-4-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-4-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deepracer-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
