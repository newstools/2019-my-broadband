Telkom will adjust the price of its fixed-line products on 1 September 2019, which will include price increases for its line rental and DSL products. The price for line rental, which all ADSL subscribers must pay, will increase from the current R200.74 to R210.00. While many Telkom subscribers will pay more for their services from September, FTTH Unlimited Home Bundle subscribers will enjoy a small price reduction. FTTH Unlimited Home Lite Bundle subscribers, however, are not affected by these price changes, and the pricing for their packages will remain the same. Up until now, Telkom’s Unlimited Home subscribers paid the same price independent of their access technology. This will change on 1 September 2019, when DSL subscribers will see a price increase while fibre subscribers will enjoy a slight price decrease. This may form part of Telkom’s strategy to migrate all customers away from ADSL and to shut down its copper network. Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko told MyBroadband that the company is hoping to exit copper entirely in the next five years. This will, however, mean that the company will need to accelerate its migration of DSL subscribers to fibre and fixed-LTE services. The higher DSL prices may be a way to push these subscribers to fibre in areas where it is available. The table below shows the difference between Telkom’s Unlimited Home fibre and DSL prices from 1 September 2019.
