Vox has launched its Wi-Fi Retail Lite solution, which offers coffee shops, restaurants, and other small service businesses the ability to offer free Wi-Fi to customers. “Retail stores can ill afford not to provide customers with high-speed Wi-Fi connectivity given the increased connected lifestyles we lead,” said Jacques Visser, head of wireless at Vox. “The days of not offering the option of a wireless connection are long gone.” Vox will also provide the option to have an engineer configure a separate private network for these businesses which enables it to easily link its own devices, point-of-sale systems, and even value-added services such as Uber Eats and Mr D Food. The company also offers a customisable Wi-Fi landing page that offers end-users several ways of logging in, including using their social media profiles, email address, cell phone number, or completing a questionnaire. Business owners can then use the information to create marketing campaigns based on demographics and historical data. There are several different packages available depending on the number of access points and marketing functions required.  To take advantage of this product, the business either needs to have existing Internet access or must sign up to a deal from Vox.
