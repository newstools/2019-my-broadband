Afrihost recently launched its new Pure Fibre products, which offer consumers a selection of uncapped and unshaped fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) packages. As part of its new product offerings, Afrihost launched an 8Mbps uncapped fibre-to-the-home service on Openserve’s network for R399 per month. Afrihost also launched an 8Mbps uncapped and unshaped product on Vumatel’s network for R499 per month. These services make it affordable for people with Openserve or Vumatel coverage to enjoy an uncapped and unshaped fibre connection. These are, however, only some of the affordable uncapped fibre products available to South African consumers. Here are the most affordable uncapped FTTH products in the country from prominent fibre ISPs.
