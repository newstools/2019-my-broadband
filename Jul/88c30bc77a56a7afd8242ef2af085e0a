Huawei has launched its new Y9 Prime 2019 mid-range smartphone in South Africa, which the company said will compete with Samsung’s recently-launched Galaxy A Series devices. Upon launching its Galaxy A Series smartphones in South Africa, Samsung said that it hoped the devices would claim back some of the market share it had lost to Huawei in the mid-range market segment. The Galaxy A Series comprises devices priced from as low as R1,299 up to R12,999. The varied pricing of this new range is partially due to the old J series being merged into the new lineup, but it is also a strong push by the company to offer more value-oriented products to consumers. Huawei has seen great success in the mid-range smartphone sector locally, and although Samsung’s Galaxy A Series aims to challenge this, Huawei did not wait for very long before rolling out its newest mid-range device to try and secure its foothold on the market. This increased push for competition is great for South African consumers who are looking for cutting-edge smartphones that offer flagship features at a mid-range price. We compared the specifications and features of the Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 with the Samsung Galaxy A50, which is its closest competitor in terms of pricing. Both the Y9 Prime 2019 and Galaxy A50 feature fingerprint sensors; the Y9 Prime’s is mounted at the traditional spot on the rear of the device, while the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen sensor underneath its display. The Y9 Prime 2019 may have a slightly larger screen, but the Samsung Galaxy A50 has an OLED panel, which enables the addition of an under-screen fingerprint sensor as well as delivering a better contrast ratio. Huawei has implemented a unique feature on its Y9 Prime 2019 which allows for its impressive screen-to-body ratio: a pop-up selfie camera which automatically extends and retracts when it is in use. This front-facing camera is covered by a special warranty and is tested to endure great mechanical stress. Both the Samsung and Huawei smartphones offer similar capabilities in terms of battery capacity, CPU performance, storage, RAM, and connectivity. Below are the specifications and local pricing for the Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 and Samsung Galaxy A50. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-314771" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-vs-Galaxy-A50-2.jpg" alt="Y9 Prime 2019 vs Galaxy A50 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-vs-Galaxy-A50-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-vs-Galaxy-A50-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-vs-Galaxy-A50-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While both smartphones offer similar performance, the Samsung Galaxy A50 is almost R1,000 more expensive than Huawei’s new device – a gap which makes a big difference at this price point. It should be noted that for this higher price, you do get an OLED display, in-screen fingerprint sensor, IP68 water and dust resistance, and the ability to use Samsung Pay. Huawei is working on its own smartphone app for cardless payments, but Samsung’s solution is currently the only one from a major device manufacturer which is widely available in the country. The Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 has its advantages, too, namely the support for GPU Turbo technology included in its EMUI operating system which delivers much better gaming performance and power efficiency. Fans of bezel-less displays may also prefer the design of the Y9 Prime 2019’s pop-up camera compared to the traditional bezel on the Galaxy A50. Both devices offer great features at highly competitive prices, making them two of the best choices for South African consumers looking for the best value in their smartphone purchase. The choice between these two smartphones may boil down to how much you are willing to spend on a handset – as both offer great value at their price points.
