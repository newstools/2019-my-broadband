Google is working to implement a play button in its Chrome browser toolbar, ZDNet reports. This button will allow users to pause and resume media playing in their browser, regardless of which tab the media originates from. The feature will be named Global Media Controls, and has been rolled out to the latest version of Chromeâ€™s Canary distribution. The media controls are placed to the right of the URL bar in the current iteration of the feature, and display a pop-up menu when hovered over which allows users to pause or resume media. There is currently no date for the public release of Global Media Controls, although the development of the functionality is chronicled in the Chromium bug tracker.
