Avengers: Endgame has surpassed Avatar as the highest-grossing film of all time, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced at San Diego Comic-Con. Endgame has now earned over $2.9 billion in revenue, overtaking James Cameron’s Avatar which previously held the record of $2.79 billion in earnings. Feige noted that if you adjust for inflation however, Avatar still remains the highest-grossing film of all time. Endgame’s success at overtaking Avatar to become the biggest film of all time comes after Marvel re-released an updated version of Endgame to cinemas worldwide, including new and deleted scenes. Only five new scenes were included in the updated version, but the added boost from the re-release ensured that Endgame overtook Avatar to become the biggest movie ever made.
