Vodacom has demonstrated Africa’s first live, 5G data session on a commercially ready 5G mobile phone and network at this year’s Vodacom Durban July. The data session was successfully completed using LG’s V50 ThinQ 5G smartphone and was carried using Nokia’s AirScale 5G radio network solution. The Nokia Airscale 5G radio network solution uses an active antenna, with 128 antenna elements (64 receive and 64 transmit) to deliver the latest 5G mMIMO (Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology. It also supports the latest 5G new radio (NR) technology and can support concurrent 4G and 5G operation on the same radio. “We are proud to be part of this Africa-first feat with Vodacom, and are committed to supporting the operator in bringing 5G services to the nation,” said Nokia’s Deon Geyser. The LG V50 ThinQ 5G features a Qualcomm SDM855 Snapdragon 855 chipset – the world’s first commercial 5G mobile platform. The chipset features the Snapdragon X50 5G modem which supports download speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second. The Snapdragon X50 5G modem, paired with up to 4 QTM052 mmWave antenna modules, supports advanced mobility features like beam forming, beam steering and beam tracking.
