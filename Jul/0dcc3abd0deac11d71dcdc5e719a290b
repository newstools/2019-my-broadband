Microsoft is developing a new feature for the open-source Chromium web browsing engine which will let users view text as they type it into a password field. A new commit made by Microsoft for the Chromium engine shows that the tool could be toggled on or off by a dedicated hotkey. “This change implements the reveal button for <input type=”password” />,” the commit stated. “A keydown handler is added to support Alt-F8 hotkey to reveal/obscure password and logics are added to make sure the reveal button only appears with direct user input.” As the tool is being developed for Chromium, it could eventually roll out to all Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft’s upcoming, overhauled Edge browser.
