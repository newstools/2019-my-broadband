Instagram has announced a change to its account disable policy, which it leverages to ban accounts that have posted content which violates the platform’s guidelines. “Under our existing policy, we disable accounts that have a certain percentage of violating content,” Instagram said in a blog post. “We are now rolling out a new policy where, in addition to removing accounts with a certain percentage of violating content, we will also remove accounts with a certain number of violations within a window of time.” The social media platform will also begin warning users who have posted violating content that their account is at risk of being disabled. This notification will allow affected users to appeal the deletion of content, and if they are successful, the violation will be removed from their profile’s record. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-313905" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Instagram-account-disable.jpg" alt="Instagram account disable" width="640" height="550" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Instagram-account-disable.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Instagram-account-disable-465x400.jpg 465w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Instagram-account-disable-500x430.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
