Data from NetMarketShare shows that the Windows 10 users barely grew over the course of June, increasing by just 0.06% to a market share of 45.79%. Windows 7’s market share dropped slightly from 35.44% to 35.38%, and these numbers are expected to continue their decline after Microsoft announced that support for this operating system will end in January 2020. Microsoft has recommended that users upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 to continue receiving updates in the future, but these market share figures show that not many users are heeding this advice. Windows 8.1 surprisingly increased its market share from 3.97% to 4.51%, while macOS declined by just 0.03% to 5.31%. Windows XP continues to witness its user base decline, but it still boasts a 1.81% share of the market – which is higher than Linux’s 1.55% market share.
