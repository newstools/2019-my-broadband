In May, Webafrica launched capped Telkom fixed-LTE packages on a month-to-month basis, and it has now added an uncapped product to its range [for more details, click here]. The new uncapped Telkom LTE package is priced at R899 per month and it is delivered within 5 days after ordering. The speed of the service is 10Mbps for the first 150GB, 4Mbps for the next 50GB and then 2Mbps for the rest of the month. All Webafrica’s Telkom fixed-LTE packages come with a free router and users can cancel with one calendar month’s notice. A customer is entitled to use the router for as long as their package is active. If cancelled, users may return the router or choose to purchase it. The table below provides an overview of Webafrica’s Telkom fixed-LTE packages.
