Apple has registered two tablet models with the Eurasian Economic Commission which appear to be new additions to its iPad range, TechRadar reports. The filings do not offer significant information about these new iPads, except that they will run Apple’s recently-launched iPadOS. TechRadar speculates that these could be new iPad Pro devices, although one of them could also be a replacement for the entry-level 9.7-inch iPad, which was introduced back in March 2018. However, since the iPad Pro received a new design less than a year ago, it is unlikely that these models would offer a change in design – it is more likely they will offer improved performance compared to previous models. Some rumours have suggested that Apple’s upcoming iPads will offer improved reception due to innovations in the devices’ antennae.
