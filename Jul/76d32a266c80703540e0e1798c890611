Match has officially announced a lightweight version of its mobile dating app named Tinder Lite. Previous reports pointed to the existence of Tinder Lite, which uses less data and storage space and is aimed at developing markets, but the company has now confirmed the launch of the software for Android. Tinder Lite includes major Tinder features while running faster, consuming less battery, and reducing network usage by around 20%. “As the world becomes more connected, it’s essential that Tinder delivers on its fundamental value: giving users everywhere the opportunity to meet new people,” said Tinder CEO Elie Seidman. “Tinder Lite demonstrates our commitment to providing greater access to our expanding, global community and creating more moments for our users to connect with people they may have never met otherwise.” Tinder Lite is available for download on the Google Play Store and will roll out to Vietnam in the coming weeks, with plans to expand into other parts of Southeast Asia and South America.
