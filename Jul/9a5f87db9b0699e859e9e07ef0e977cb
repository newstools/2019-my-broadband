Vodacom has launched its new VodaPay Masterpass mobile app in South Africa, which uses Mastercard’s global digital payment service to facilitate tokenised bank card payments. The app is available on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, and is developed by the same company which created the Masterpass applications for South African banks. According to its store listings, the VodaPay Masterpass app was first published on 26 June 2019, and it has yet to be downloaded by a large number of users. To begin using the app, consumers must simply verify their mobile phone number and then load their bank card as a payment method by either inputting their details manually or scanning the card. The Masterpass environment facilitates online, mobile, and in-store purchases, and supports a number of different payment methods. The VodaPay also enables the purchase of airtime, data, and other mobile products by supporting Vodacom’s Express Recharge – a USSD platform which allows customers to buy airtime and data using their bank card. The VodaPay Masterpass functionality includes the ability to scan QR codes and make payments over the Zapper and Snapscan platforms. Vodacom customers can also top up their mobile balances in the application after adding their compatible bank card. This means that without leaving the VodaPay Masterpass app, users can purchase airtime, data bundles, voice bundles, and SMS bundles, in addition to making SnapScan and Zapper payments. The app includes menus which allow you to consolidate your payment receipts and manage your profile. Users can also pay their bills through the VodaPay Masterpass app, including their DStv account and their TV Licence. Screenshots of the VodaPay Masterpass application are posted below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-312345" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-1-640x409.jpg" alt="VodaPay screenshot 1" width="640" height="409" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-1-640x409.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-1-600x383.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-1-768x490.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-1-1200x766.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-312347" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-2-640x409.jpg" alt="VodaPay screenshot 2" width="640" height="409" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-2-640x409.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-2-600x383.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-2-768x490.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/VodaPay-screenshot-2-1200x766.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Vodacom told MyBroadband that its VodaPay Masterpass app is on track to commercially launch in August 2019. “The standalone digital wallet, currently in pilot phase, conveniently gives customers the ability to settle third-party payments such as DSTV, utilities and pay traffic fines in addition to purchasing airtime and data bundles,” Vodacom said. “The app will also facilitate SnapScan and Zapper payments,” Vodacom said. While the app has not launched commercially yet, it is still available to download from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
