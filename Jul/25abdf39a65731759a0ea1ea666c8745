A team of scientists at the University of California have built a prototype contact lens which can zoom in at the wearer’s command. The technology, which was detailed in a paper published in Advanced Function Materials, relies on electrophysiological signals to translate user actions into commands for controlling the contact lens. The contact lens is a form of human-machine interface which responds to electric signals generated by the wearer’s eyes when they perform specific actions. For example, wearers can command the contact lens to zoom in or zoom back out by simply blinking twice. The prototype currently requires the subject to have electrodes placed around their eyes to pick up these electrophysiological signals, although the scientists hope to employ their technology across multiple applications in the future, from specialised prosthetics to adjustable glasses.
