CareerJunction has released its latest CareerJunction Index (CJI) report, which showed a continued decline in the number of advertised jobs in South Africa. The CJI is based on data gathered from the CareerJunction website and monitors the labour market in South Africa by examining supply and demand trends. The report revealed weakening employment prospects and increased competition for jobs in South Africa. Demand has weakened considerably year-on-year across the admin, office and support, engineering, business and management, and ICT sectors. This negative employment data is not unexpected. South Africa’s unemployment rate has hit a high of 27.6% at the end of the first quarter of 2019 – the worst level since 2017. The only way to increase employment is to grow the economy, but this is not happening. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered South Africa’s economic growth forecast from 1.5% to 1.3% in April, citing policy and political uncertainty. The lagging employment market is therefore set to continue unless the government supports pro-business policies and encourages investment in the country. The graphs below show volume trends for job adverts in prominent fields published on the CareerJunction website over the past 12 months. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313823" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ICT.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="461" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ICT.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ICT-555x400.jpg 555w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ICT-597x430.jpg 597w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313825" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Engineering.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="461" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Engineering.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Engineering-555x400.jpg 555w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Engineering-597x430.jpg 597w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313827" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Business.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="461" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Business.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Business-555x400.jpg 555w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Business-597x430.jpg 597w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
