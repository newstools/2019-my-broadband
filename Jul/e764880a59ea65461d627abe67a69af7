Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced yesterday that long-time executive JB Straubel is stepping down from his position as Tesla CTO after 15 years in the position, The Verge reports. Straubel will remain with the company, however, and will transition into a senior advisor role. “I’m not disappearing, and I just wanted to make sure that people understand that this was not some, you know, lack of confidence in the company, or the team,” Straubel said. Musk said that VP of Technology Drew Baglino will assume Straubel’s responsibilities, although he did not make it clear if Baglino would officially become the new Tesla CTO. “I’d like to thank JB for his fundamental role in creating and enabling Tesla,” said Musk on a call with analysts. “If we hadn’t had lunch in 2003, Tesla wouldn’t wouldn’t exist, basically.” Straubel is the second C-level executive to resign from Tesla in the past six months, after former CFO Deepak Ahuja announced his retirement in January.
