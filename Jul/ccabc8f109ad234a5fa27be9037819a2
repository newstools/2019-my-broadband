Nvidia recently announced its new Super range of GeForce RTX graphics cards, which offer more cores, higher clock speeds, and increased memory over the original models. The GeForce RTX 2060 Super boasts 8GB of RAM – 2GB more than the original RTX 2060 – and is almost as powerful as the original GeForce RTX 2070. Both the GeForce RTX 2070 and 2080 Super graphics cards are expected to replace the original versions in the market, since the provided US pricing is identical to that of the original models. They both provide improved performance over their original versions. The RTX 2070 Super uses a watered-down version of the original RTX 2080’s chip, while the RTX 2080 Super boasts more CUDA cores and increased clock speeds when compared to the older version. Local online hardware retailers have begun listing these new graphics cards on their websites. These GPUs are not yet available to purchase, but will release in the coming weeks. Wootware told MyBroadband that it expects to have stock of its Palit GeForce RTX 2060 and RTX 2070 Super graphics cards by 16 July. Other brands’ launch dates will be released once Wootware has received confirmation from suppliers. MyBroadband contacted Rebel Tech about the expected release date of its range, but the retailer did not respond by the time of publication. Below are the specifications and South African pricing of the new RTX Super range of graphics cards.
