Afrihost recently launched its new Pure Fibre products, which offer consumers a selection of uncapped and unshaped fibre-to-the-home packages. These packages are offered on most fibre network operators and deliver some of the best value in the South African fibre market. To encourage users to switch to Afrihost Pure Fibre, Afrihost is offering up to R5,000 in value to clients who sign up. New Afrihost Pure Fibre subscribers will receive free installation and activation, a Wi-Fi router, and up to 2 months free service. Additionally, existing fibre users who migrate their lines from another ISP will be given credit equal to their migration fees, a Wi-Fi router, and up to three months free service. Afrihost highlighted that there are only a limited number of new R5,000 Pure Fibre specials available. To celebrate its new Pure Fibre products, Afrihost partnered with MyBroadband to give away a free 100Mbps Pure Fibre connection for two years worth R25,000.
