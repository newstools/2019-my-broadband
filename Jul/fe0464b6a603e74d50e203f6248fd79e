Update – YouTube originally stated it had partnered with SuperSport to deliver live sports streaming on its platform, but it has subsequently issued an updated statement omitting any mention of SuperSport. YouTube announced that it has partnered with NBA Africa to offer live and video-on-demand streaming of basketball, rugby, cricket, and football on its platform. Sports content available on the platform will include the 2019 NBA Finals, Women’s World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), UEFA Champions and Europa leagues, ABSA Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A. YouTube said that sports consumption on its platform is growing quickly in Africa, and the company has seen a 70% increase in sports viewing across the EMEA region. “It goes without saying that Africa is a sport-loving continent, so it makes perfect sense for us to bring African sports fans what they love,” said YouTube content partnerships lead Dayo Olopade. “Our audience is constantly looking for sports content on YouTube.” “Today we are here to say we hear you and we are more than happy to bring you the content you desire, in partnership with NBA Africa and our other partners,” she said. YouTube said that the UEFA Champions League, ABSA Premiership, La Liga, Serie A, Women’s World Cup, UFC, and AFCON would be available as highlight and video-on-demand content – not direct live streams. YouTube will be the second major video-on-demand platform to offer live sports streaming in South Africa. Showmax recently launched a sports offering to its subscribers, allowing them to watch live rugby and cricket games in addition to various sports magazine shows. “We’ll be ramping up our live game offerings with everything from selected matches from the best football leagues in Europe to streaming a wide variety of varsity and school sports,” Showmax said. “Showmax is branching out and adding both pre-recorded and live sport content to its current line-up.” “The move into live streaming is a first for Showmax in Africa.”
