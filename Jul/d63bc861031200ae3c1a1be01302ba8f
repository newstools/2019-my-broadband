Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2, one of the most popular video games to release in 2018, seems likely to be launched on PC. Twitter user JakoMako51 recently discovered lines in the Rockstar Social Club source code which made reference to “RDR2_PC_Accomplishments.” Other source code referring to PC gaming has also been found in the past, such as references to “PARAM_companionAutoConnectIpPC” and “CommandIsPcVersion(void)”. The first iteration of Rockstar’s popular Western game – Red Dead Redemption – did not ever release on PC, but PC gamers have been hoping that this would change with the latest title. While it now seems likely that Rockstar will satisfy these requests, there is no indication of when a PC port would become available. Red Dead Redemption 2 was rated by Metacritic as the best game ever made on PS4 and Xbox One just one week after its release.
