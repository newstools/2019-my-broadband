If you are looking for an online streaming service to deliver great shows on-demand in South Africa, your two best options are Showmax and Netflix. Both have their differences in terms of resolution, pricing, and original shows, but they offer some of the newest and best shows on TV. You would not have been able to watch Game of Thrones through any other streaming service than Showmax, and Netflix is home to wildly popular originals such as Stranger Things. There is a difference in the available content on each platform, but both are great options for South Africans who’ve cut the cord and moved to Internet-based entertainment. To provide a rough overview of the amount of high-quality content available on each streaming platform, we looked at IMDb’s highest-rated films and series of all time. We then cross-referenced these shows with the catalogue of titles available on both Showmax and Netflix South Africa, noting when a title was only available on one streaming platform or on both. Interestingly, the number of instances where a show was available across both platforms was relatively small, even in the case of older films and series. The comparison of content availability using highly-rated shows does not deliver a comprehensive picture of the content difference between the two platforms, as Netflix has more than double the number of films as Showmax does. However, it does show that both platforms offer high-quality content and if you are a fan of good-quality shows, you would be best served by subscribing to both streaming services. Below the top-rated films and series of all time on IMDb which were available to watch on Netflix or Showmax at the time of writing. Shows which were in the IMDb rankings but not available on either platform were excluded from the comparison.
