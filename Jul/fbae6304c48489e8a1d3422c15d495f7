WhatsApp is working on a new quick edit media shortcut which will be enabled in the next few updates, WABetaInfo reports. This feature helps users to save time and storage by allowing them to quickly and easily edit media they have sent and received in their chats and groups. Upon opening media in a chat, WhatsApp users will be able to select a new “Edit” shortcut that will automatically redirect to the image editing screen. It should be noted that editing and saving an image this way will not override the previous media, but will create a new file which can be sent to other chats. The quick edit media shortcut will be available for Android and iOS and is currently under development. There is currently no confirmed launch date for the feature.
