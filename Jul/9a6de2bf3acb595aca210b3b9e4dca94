Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Note 10 will not feature Qualcomm’s recently-announced Snapdragon 855 Plus chip, WinFuture reports. The Snapdragon 855 Plus was unveiled by Qualcomm last week and will offer noticeable increases in performance to premium smartphone users. However, the Galaxy Note 10 will reportedly include the original Snapdragon 855 processor, which is currently used by the Galaxy S10. Reports also suggest that the Note 10 will be available in certain countries with Samsung’s latest Exynos chip, which means that the performance of the device will likely differ depending on the region in which it is being sold. Google’s Pixel 4 is now expected to be the first phone to launch with the new Snapdragon 855 Plus chip.
