Valve has launched a new project named Steam Labs, which allows PC gamers to try out experimental features before they are implemented. Steam Labs allows gamers to provide feedback on upcoming features and concepts, some of which may never be added to the public Steam platform. “Every year, we create dozens of experiments around discoverability, video, machine learning, and more,” Steam said on its Labs page. “You know who we thought might enjoy seeing them? Everyone.” Three experiments are active for users to try out at the moment, all of which are designed to help gamers find new titles. These features are Micro Trailers, Interactive Recommender, and Automatic Show. Micro Trailers are six-second trailers for every Steam game, the Interactive Recommender uses machine learning to recommend games you might like based on the titles you have played, and Automatic Show is an automatically-generated half-hour show about the latest and most popular games each day. Steam users can sign up for the Steam Labs experiments on the project’s official page.
