Tesla has announced a new energy storage product named Megapack which is modelled after the large-scale battery installation it constructed in Australia. Megapack aims to reduce the complexity of large-scale battery storage solutions by providing an easy installation and connection process. Each Megapack product is shipped fully assembled and delivers up to 3MWhs of storage and 1.5MW of inverter capacity. “Using Megapack, Tesla can deploy an emissions-free 250 MW, 1 GWh power plant in less than three months on a three-acre footprint – four times faster than a traditional fossil fuel power plant of that size,” the company said. Tesla has also developed its own software named PowerHub to monitor and control Megapack installations. “Megapack is designed for utilities and large-scale commercial customers,” Tesla said. “Our team of experts will work with you to identify custom site needs, and design a solution to maximize project values across multiple applications.”
