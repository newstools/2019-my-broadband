Afrihost launched its new Pure Fibre products this week, offering subscribers a fibre solution that it is uncapped, unshaped, unthrottled, and unmetered. To encourage users to switch to Afrihost Pure Fibre, the ISP is offering up to R5,000 in value to new clients. The value includes free installation and activation, a Wi-Fi router, and up to 2 months’ free service. As one of the largest ISPs in South Africa, Afrihost’s aggressive Pure Fibre products will put pressure on other service providers to react. While the latest move by Afrihost was not as aggressive as its R29-per-GB ADSL product in 2009 and MWEB’s affordable uncapped ADSL products in 2010, it is still noteworthy. With its new uncapped pricing and great value proposition, it will be enticing for broadband users to consider this service. In fact, Afrihost’s new products were enough to encourage Axxess to respond within two days with its own new uncapped products. Axxess unveiled new uncapped fibre products with “no thresholds, no throttling, and no shaping” at lower prices than its current offerings. It is clear that South African ISPs are now fighting to sign up both existing and new fibre users, and are using aggressive pricing and value-adds to attract consumers. This fibre war is good news for consumers, who will see better service levels and lower prices for their fibre access. The table below provides an overview of how Afrihost’s and Axxess’ new fibre products compared with competing products in the market from a handful of prominent ISPs. We compared synchronous packages on Vumatel (lines with equivalent upload and download speeds) with Openserve’s asynchronous packages, as the latter does not offer synchronous lines.
