Takealot is in the midst of its first The Ultimate Checkout sale, which it claims is positioned to perform a similar function to other global e-commerce sales such as Amazon’s Prime Day and Alibaba’s Singles Day. “What makes The Ultimate Checkout different is that it is built on shopper behaviour and we are hoping to establish this as an annual event,” said Takealot Group CEO Kim Reid. Reid believes that there is significant interest in big shopping events in South Africa. “The year-on-year growth of Black Friday is an excellent indication of the appetite for big shopping events in SA,” said Reid. In the past, however, Takealot’s big sales have come under significant scrutiny due to allegations that their listed prices are not accurate. In June 2018, the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) ruled that Takealot’s Daily Deals listed price for a 55-inch 4K Samsung TV was misleading. Takealot’s standard price for this TV was R26,000 – making its “special” price of R15,999 look incredibly impressive. However, the ASA found that the highest price of similar TVs was between R19,000 and R20,000 – meaning that Takealot was misleading consumers into thinking they were saving more than was actually the case. MyBroadband investigated how Takealot’s Ultimate Checkout sale prices, as well as their standard prices, compare to deals from other online retailers. For this comparison, we focused on tech products and measured Takealot’s prices against a variety of local tech distributors – including Makro, Wootware, Evetech, and Loot. It should be noted that some of the competing deals were also listed as specials on their respective websites. The results of this investigation are below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-314449" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LG-UHD-TV-640x205.png" alt="LG UHD TV"
