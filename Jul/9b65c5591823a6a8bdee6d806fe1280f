Retailer Shoprite says it want to make it easier for its customers to access services including global money transfers, mobile phone purchases, bill payments, tickets and insurance with the launch of its new standalone tech stores, called K’nect, across the country. Following the successful launch of the first Shoprite K’nect at the Delft Mall in Cape Town in May 2019, the group said it is opening an additional six stores between end July and mid-August 2019. The new K’nect stores will be located in Hatfield, Rosebank, Riverside Mall, Mmabatho, Watergate Mall and Illanga Mall. Several more stores are scheduled to open by December 2019. Each store includes specialist tills for those transactions that take a little longer, including money transfers, tickets for travel & events, insurance and mobile – devices and accessories. It said that express tills cater for quick transactions, including bill payments (accounts and bills), airtime & data (top-up and recharge) as well as buying electricity and Lotto tickets. Shoprite says it offers global money transfers to 100 countries. Customers can pay in-store or transfer funds by EFT or cash deposit at specified banks, and recipients can receive funds via bank transfer, cash pick-up or mobile money, country dependent. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315033" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-1-640x426.jpg" alt="Knect 1" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-1-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315043" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-6-640x426.jpg" alt="Knect 6" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-6-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-6-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-6-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315041" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-5-640x426.jpg" alt="Knect 5" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-5-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-5-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-5-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-5.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315039" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-4-640x426.jpg" alt="Knect 4" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-4-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-4.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315037" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-3-640x426.jpg" alt="Knect 3" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-3-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-3.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315035" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-2-640x426.jpg" alt="Knect 2" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-2-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knect-2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Source: BusinessTech
