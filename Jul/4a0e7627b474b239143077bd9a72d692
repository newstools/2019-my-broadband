J.P. Morgan believes that Apple will launch a more affordable iPhone option in 2020, CNBC reports. Analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a J.P. Morgan report that he expects Apple to go after a “much more ‘value’ category than it has been used to with its recent launches”. He also predicted that this budget iPhone would be around the same size as the iPhone 8 and would include neither a 5G modem nor an OLED display. The other three 2020 iPhones will all offer OLED displays and 5G modems, Chatterjee predicts, with at least two of these models also adopting “3D Sensing (Time of Flight) driving industry-leading AR/VR capabilities”. Apple’s upcoming 2019 range of iPhones, which is expected to launch in September, is not expected to include a major redesign, nor are any of these iPhones expected to include a 5G modem.
