Driving along the N2 between Somerset West and Cape Town, you will see an ocean of yellow dish antennas mounted to the roofs of homes. You can’t miss the bright yellow colour of the dishes as you drive by on the highway, and each one bears the MTN logo. However, this is not a new satellite TV or broadband initiative from MTN, but an advertising arrangement the operator has with communities in Cape Town. “MTN identified the branding opportunity that involves painting the satellite dishes facing the highway,” the operator told MyBroadband. It engaged with communities along the N2 and N7 near Dunnon for the initiative. “Residents are approached to see if they are willing to allow the painting of their dishes and, if necessary, repairs are made to the dish, where the dish is rusted and in need of maintenance,” MTN said. The network did not give details about the value of the advertising deals, or reveal what the terms of the deal was for residents except to say that the maintenance offered is once-off. MTN works through its agency, Zinto Marketing Group, which it says sources painters from the local community to help in painting the dishes. “This approach has made sure the project ploughs back into the community both in the initial investment and then the ongoing maintenance of the branding,” said MTN. “The community involvement has also produced the added benefit of driving down theft and vandalism of the dishes, as community members are taking personal ownership of their allocated dishes.” Photos of the initiative are embedded below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312247" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-3.jpg" alt="Yellow MTN dishes in the Western Cape" width="1052" height="780" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-3.jpg 1052w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-3-539x400.jpg 539w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-3-768x569.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-3-580x430.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312245" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-4.jpg" alt="Yellow MTN dishes in the Western Cape" width="1052" height="780" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-4.jpg 1052w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-4-539x400.jpg 539w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-4-768x569.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-4-580x430.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312251" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-2.jpg" alt="Yellow MTN dishes in the Western Cape" width="1052" height="780" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-2.jpg 1052w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-2-539x400.jpg 539w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-2-768x569.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-2-580x430.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312249" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-1.jpg" alt="Yellow MTN dishes in the Western Cape" width="1052" height="780" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-1.jpg 1052w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-1-539x400.jpg 539w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-1-768x569.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-1-580x430.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312243" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-5.jpg" alt="Yellow MTN dishes in the Western Cape" width="1052" height="780" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-5.jpg 1052w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-5-539x400.jpg 539w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-5-768x569.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Yellow-MTN-dishes-in-the-Western-Cape-5-580x430.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />
