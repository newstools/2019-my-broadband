YouTube has updated its policies regarding the treatment of manual copyright claims, making it easier for content creators to deal with copyright claims on their videos. As part of this update, owners of copyrighted content will have to define where in the video the copyrighted content is used, allowing creators to quickly and simply discern between valid complaints and unfair accusations. “Our Manual Claiming system was increasingly being used to claim very short (in some cases one second) content or incidental content like when a creator walks past a store playing a few seconds of music,” said Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. “We are exploring the right balance between copyright owners and creators.” Wojcicki also expressed concerns about a recently-passed article by the EU which she claims consists of “vague, untested requirements”. “It could create serious limitations for what YouTube creators can upload. This risks lowering the revenue to traditional media and music companies from YouTube and potentially devastating the many European creators who have built their businesses on YouTube.”
