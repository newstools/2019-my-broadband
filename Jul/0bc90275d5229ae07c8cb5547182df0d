Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been at the forefront of conversations about technology and the future of work over the past few years. According to Gartner’s 2019 CIO Survey, 37 percent of organisations have implemented AI in some form. Deloitte’s 2019 Human Capital Trends report also confirms the already expanding use of AI in workspaces and sees it as an opportunity for the social enterprise. AI has the potential to transform and improve processes in the workplace, contributing to optimisation in every form. However, according to Forbes, while Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve productivity, efficiency and accuracy across an organisation, many fear that the rise of AI will lead to machines and robots replacing human workers and threatening their quality of life. As a result, organisations are challenged to reinvent themselves as social enterprises, engaging with stakeholders and cultivating performance in a human way, so they can catch up with technology. Deloitte’s Human Capital Trends report comes with a bold call to action for organisations to reinvent the social enterprise. It also examines ways in which organisations can drive the reinvention of the workforce, the organisation, and HR on a broad scale, and change every aspect of how they interact with, motivate, and create meaningful experiences for their workforce. In the face of the relentless acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive technologies, and automation, 86 percent of respondents in the Deloitte survey believe they must reinvent their ability to learn. After nearly 10 years of economic growth, and despite a pervasive corporate focus on digital transformation, 84 percent of respondents said they need to rethink their workforce experience to improve productivity. 39 percent of South African respondents said that they think their employees will have an easier time finding a new job with a new employer than within their current organisation. This is also shown by research which shows that the number-one reason people quit their jobs is the “inability to learn and grow”. Therefore, as automation becomes more prevalent in the workplace, there is a need to put meaning back into work. The magnitude of the disruptions to the workforce and the workplace – and their consequent impact on employers – is why Deloitte deliberately chose the word, “reinvent”. By reinventing, you can go back to the core – and make a strong, lasting, foundational change within an organisation. To help guide organisations through the reinvention process, Deloitte has put in place a set of human principles for the social enterprise. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-313773 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Benchmarks-for-reinvention-640x399.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="399" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Benchmarks-for-reinvention-640x399.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Benchmarks-for-reinvention-600x375.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Benchmarks-for-reinvention-768x479.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Benchmarks-for-reinvention.jpg 926w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> According to Deloitte, these five principles frame the “human focus” for the social enterprise and serve as benchmarks against which you can measure any action or business decision that could affect people. Living in a world of technology is amazing, but it is – and always will be – human potential that moves us forward, said Deloitte.
