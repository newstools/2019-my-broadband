Boeing has announced it will start a $100-million fund to help the families and communities of the victims who died in two 737 Max crashes in October last year. Boeing said that these funds will support living expenses of the impacted families, community programmes, and economic development in impacted communities. “We at Boeing are sorry for the tragic loss of lives in both of these accidents and these lives lost will continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and on our minds for years to come,” said Bowing CEO Dennis Muilenberg. “The families and loved ones of those on board have our deepest sympathies, and we hope this initial outreach can help bring them comfort.” Boeing added that its employees will also be given the opportunity to make donations in support of those affected by the accidents, which will be matched by Boeing up until the end of the year.
