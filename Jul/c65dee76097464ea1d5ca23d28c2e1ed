Twitter has begun rolling out its overhauled desktop interface for web browsers, which includes a number of new features. The new Twitter website has improved access to features such as Explore, Lists, and Bookmarks, as well as making it easier to switch between accounts without logging out and back in again. The overhaul aims to make conversations easier to follow and aligns the Twitter web interface with the design of the company’s mobile app. Twitter is also adding dim and dark modes along with various other colour schemes, allowing users to personalise their desktop interface. The platform’s redesigned desktop web experience has begun rolling out to users worldwide, and if you do not have access to it yet, you should be able to use the new features soon.
