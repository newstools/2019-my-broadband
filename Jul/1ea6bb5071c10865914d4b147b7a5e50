Telkom will adjust its fixed-line prices on 1 September 2019, which include price increases in line rental, voice bundle and ADSL services. The company added that fixed customers on wireless technology will be migrated to SmartVoice during August 2019 and will not be impacted by the rate adjustment. While many Telkom subscribers will pay more for their services from September, FTTH Unlimited Home Bundle subscribers will enjoy a small price reduction. FTTH Unlimited Home Lite Bundle subscribers, however, are not affected by these price changes, and their pricing for their packages will remain the same. The table below provides an overview of the current and new FTTH Unlimited Home Bundle prices.
