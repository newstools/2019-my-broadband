Apple is considering dropping the butterfly keyboard design on its MacBook devices in favour of a more robust solution, MacRumours reports. The company will reportedly use a new keyboard for its upcoming MacBook Air model based on a scissor switch design. These keyboard switches should offer improved durability and better key travel, resolving the pervasive issues with the butterfly switches implemented on modern MacBook devices. The butterfly keyboard design has been criticised for its tendency to fail under slight stress, and Apple reportedly hopes to improve the reliability of its keyboards with this design. Earlier this year, Apple acknowledged that there were issues with its existing MacBook keyboard design, following a class-action lawsuit being filed against the company.
