Apple plans to launch its new virtual credit card in the first half of August in partnership with Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg reports. This is aligned with the original release date that Apple announced back in March, and will allow iPhone users to sign up for the card via their Wallet app. The card’s software and design have been completed by Apple, while Goldman Sachs is in charge of the infrastructure, transaction data, and information management. “Apple is a great partner and we together are excited about delivering a product that we think customers will love,” said a Goldman Sachs spokesman. The card is set to roll out soon, despite Apple reportedly expressing concern earlier this year over the technology Goldman Sachs was planning to use to power the card. Apple reportedly asked Goldman Sachs to change certain mechanics that powered the card, although it is uncertain whether Goldman Sachs complied with these requests.
