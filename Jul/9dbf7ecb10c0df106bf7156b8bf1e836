Uber has begun testing a new monthly subscription package which includes discounts on food delivery, rides, and Jump scooters, TechCrunch reports. The company is reportedly testing the subscription option in San Francisco and Chicago, offering fixed discounts on rides and free Uber Eats deliveries. “From meals to wheels and everything in between, we’re always looking for ways to make Uber the go-to option for your everyday needs,” Uber told TechCrunch. The company previously launched its Ride Pass monthly subscription in selected cities, but this is the company’s first attempt at offering a subscription service which includes discounts on its entire range of consumer offerings. MyBroadband asked Uber South Africa whether this monthly subscription offering would launch locally, but the company did not respond by the time of publication.
