The Microsoft-owned Android keyboard app SwiftKey has added a new augmented reality emoji feature similar to Apple’s Animoji. Called Puppets, this feature allows users to create a virtual character which they can control with their head movements via the front-facing camera. The animated emoji use artificial intelligence to replicate the users’ facial expressions on a selection of animated characters, including a panda, owl, dinosaur, and cat. Microsoft said this functionality would work on all Android devices which support the SwiftKey app, and will begin rolling out in the near future. To begin using Puppets immediately, Android smartphone owners can download the SwiftKey Beta from the Google Play Store.
