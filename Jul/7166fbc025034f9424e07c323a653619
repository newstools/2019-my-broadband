Vodacom has launched a new “Red Hot Deal” promotion, where it offers big price cuts on large data bundles at its brick-and-mortar stores. While the Red Hot Deal promotion is included in Vodacom’s latest booklet, details about the promotion are kept secret to encourage consumers to visit a Vodacom store. MyBroadband gathered information from multiple Vodacom stores, and all the stores had the same three deals on offer: These deals are all available on a 24-month contract. Night Owl data can be used between midnight and 05:00. These deals are available until 6 August 2019. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-312923" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vodacom-Deal.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="841" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vodacom-Deal.jpg 688w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vodacom-Deal-304x400.jpg 304w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vodacom-Deal-327x430.jpg 327w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
