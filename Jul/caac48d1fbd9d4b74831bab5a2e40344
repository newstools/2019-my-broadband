ASUS has unveiled its second-generation ROG Phone II, which is designed specifically for mobile gamers and features various improvements over the first-generation ROG Phone. “The ROG Phone II incorporates everything we’ve learned from our first foray into high-end gaming phones and then some to create another pocketable gaming powerhouse,” said ASUS. The ROG Phone II is the first smartphone which is confirmed to be using Qualcomm’s latest chip, the Snapdragon 855 Plus. It will also sport a 120Hz display, 12GB of RAM, 512GB storage, and a 3D vapour chamber cooling system – making it a gaming powerhouse. It includes a fingerprint sensor under the screen, and as expected from a ROG device, it comes with an RGB LED logo. The ROG Phone II will run an Android 9-based operating system and comes with a number of accessories such as a controller, several docks, and a cooler. The smartphone is expected to launch internationally today, but no pricing is available yet. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-314183" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-Gaming-640x409.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="409" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-Gaming-640x409.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-Gaming-600x384.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-Gaming-768x491.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-Gaming-1200x767.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-314185" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-ports-640x311.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="311" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-ports-640x311.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-ports-600x292.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-ports-768x374.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-ports-1200x584.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-314187" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-back-640x422.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="422" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-back-640x422.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-back-600x395.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-back-768x506.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ROG-Phone-II-back-1200x791.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
