Uber Eats has begun rolling out a new feature in some cities which allows users to order their meal through the app and eat it at the restaurant. TechCrunch reported that this new Dine-in option waives the standard Uber delivery and service fees, and gives restaurants 100% of the tips let by the users in the app. Uber confirmed the existence of the Dine-In feature to TechCrunch, stating that it was always looking for ways to enhance the experience available through its platform. The Uber Eats FAQ web page includes more information regarding the Dine-in order option: “A Dine-in order is when you place an order through the Eats app and you go to the restaurant to collect it,” the company states. “You can then choose to sit in the restaurant to eat your food.” In cities where the feature is available, Uber Eats users can find the Dine-in option next the Delivery and Pick-Up sections at the top of the mobile app.
