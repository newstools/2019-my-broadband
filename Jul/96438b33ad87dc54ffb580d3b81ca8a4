Axiz attended the annual Microsoft Inspire Worldwide Partner Conference from the week 15 to 18 July 2019.  This event is attended by over sixteen thousand of Microsoft’s closest friends and key partner-facing staff. This was the second year that Microsoft READY was included with the Partner group which made connecting with key Microsoft people a real win. On Monday 15 July, Gavriella Schuster started her core note with the declaration that Microsoft was committed to “listening to partner feedback” and will roll back the planned changes they announced to kick off 1 October 2019.  That recent announcement indicated that Microsoft would be making changes to partner Internal Use Rights (IUR) and competency timelines, effective 1 July 2020.  The audience responded with claps and cheers. <img class="size-full wp-image-314837 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inspire-2019-Core-note-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inspire-2019-Core-note-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inspire-2019-Core-note-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inspire-2019-Core-note-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The most notable presenter was Simon Sinek (a British-American author, motivational speaker and organisational consultant) who went on stage shortly after the announcement to make us all think about something else.  His inspirational comments included, “how leadership is about looking after people in our charge” and how “trust and honesty” build better businesses. Judson Althoff, Executive Vice President of Microsoft’s Worldwide Commercial Business, followed thereafter. He shared with the packed auditorium how partners that have formulated a business practise by solution areas have grown the revenue for themselves and these relationships have meant that they are “living with their customers beyond the deal”.  Using Microsoft technology to deliver a business outcome needs to remain the core of customer discussions. On Wednesday 17 July it was the turn of Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, to share with the world his take on the future of the company and his views ahead.  It was a full T-Mobile arena in Vegas with a crowd of forty thousand people who stood to their feet just before he began. His core note was inspiring to say the least, and the focus of the message was on 100, 17, and 7.  This reference was to 100,000 employees, 17 million partners and 7 billion people on the planet.  He continued to share how Microsoft’s mission remains to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more. With their technology the view is to make every small business productive and to make every large business more competitive, to make every government more responsive, to provide access to education, to improve health care outcomes, and to amplify human ingenuity. <img class="size-full wp-image-314839 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inspire-2019-Core-Note.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inspire-2019-Core-Note.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inspire-2019-Core-Note-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Inspire-2019-Core-Note-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Brad Smith, Microsoft’s Chief Legal Officer, had the tough job of presenting after Satya and spent his session sharing with the audience the “AI for good” campaign that Microsoft drives to ensure that the world is clear on Microsoft’s objectives. He spoke about how the technology community needs to be responsible citizens and about how Microsoft is working with countries to create the Global Tech Accord – a sign of how serious Microsoft is about earning trust globally.
