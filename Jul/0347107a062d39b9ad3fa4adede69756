Stratusolve has launched a full stack web and mobile app development framework called Divblox which makes it easier and faster to build web and mobile applications. Stratusolve is a software company based in Centurion which specialises in creating innovative, cloud-based software solutions. Their Divblox framework has a web-first approach. This means users will also create their web app first using languages like HTML, JavaScript and CSS. This code can then be exported as a native iOS or Android app which can be uploaded to the Google Play store or Apple’s App store. The result is a web app and Android and iOS mobile applications with a single code base which covers all aspects of a solution. A big benefit of Divblox is its user-friendliness. Anyone – from analysts to hard core developers – can collaborate to create great applications. Because Divblox automatically deals with many tedious items which slows down the development process, companies can go to market 3 to 5 times faster.
