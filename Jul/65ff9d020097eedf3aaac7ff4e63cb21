Amazon announced that its Prime Day promotional period will kick off at 09:00 on 15 July 2019. Specials will run for 48 hours, with new deals launching every five minutes in addition to specials which will be available throughout the entire period. “For the first time ever, Prime members will enjoy a full 48 hours of epic fun on more than a million deals worldwide – giving them the best in shopping and savings,” Amazon said. Prime Day 2019 will also include featured Lightning Deals which are expected to sell out quickly due to their larger discounts. “These deals could sell out fast, so we encourage Prime members to come back frequently to view new deals launching throughout the 48-hour event,” Amazon said.
