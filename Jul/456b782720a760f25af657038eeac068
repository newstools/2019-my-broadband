Samsung will hold its second Unpacked event of 2019 on 7 August, where it is expected to launch the new Galaxy Note 10. The company didnâ€™t explicitly state that it would unveil the device, but the image of a pen used to market the event all but confirms the launch of the Note 10. Leaks suggest that there will be three versions of the Note 10 to launch in the United States: a small 6.25-inch version, a 6.75-inch Note 10+, and a Note 10 5G, although it is unclear which of these will be available in South Africa. The Note 10 is not expected to include a headphone jack, and only the Note 10+ is expected to offer microSD capabilities. The smartphone has also been subject to numerous 3D renders by those with access to leaked data. A render of the Note 10 + (formerly believed to be called the Note 10 Pro) is below.
