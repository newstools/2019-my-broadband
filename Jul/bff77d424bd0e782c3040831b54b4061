Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale has begun, offering great deals to Amazon Prime subscribers. Prime Day, which began at 09:00 on 15 July, will run for 48 hours and offer great savings on a variety of products – including some awesome tech deals. “For the first time ever, Prime members will enjoy a full 48 hours of epic fun on more than a million deals worldwide – giving them the best in shopping and savings,” Amazon said when announcing the event. Over the course of the sale, Amazon will also be offering “lightning deals” which offer even bigger discounts but are only available for a limited period of time. “These deals could sell out fast, so we encourage Prime members to come back frequently to view new deals launching throughout the 48-hour event,” said Amazon. It must be noted that sale is exclusively available to Amazon Prime members and certain products may not ship to South Africa directly. MyBroadband listed some of the best Prime Day tech deals below. Prices include shipping costs. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313387" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/radeon-7-2700x-639x430.png" alt="" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/radeon-7-2700x-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/radeon-7-2700x-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/radeon-7-2700x-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/radeon-7-2700x.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313389" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/msi-radeon-rx590-639x430.png" alt="msi radeon rx590" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/msi-radeon-rx590-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/msi-radeon-rx590-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/msi-radeon-rx590-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/msi-radeon-rx590.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313391" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/X300_Highlihgt_Product_Image_V2-639x430.png" alt="X300_Highlihgt_Product_Image_V2" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/X300_Highlihgt_Product_Image_V2-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/X300_Highlihgt_Product_Image_V2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/X300_Highlihgt_Product_Image_V2-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/X300_Highlihgt_Product_Image_V2.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313393" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hd-pro-webcam-c920-640x360.jpg" alt="hd-pro-webcam-c920" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hd-pro-webcam-c920-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hd-pro-webcam-c920-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hd-pro-webcam-c920-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hd-pro-webcam-c920.jpg 930w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-246179" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Razer-Naga-Trinity-3.jpg" alt="Razer Naga Trinity 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Razer-Naga-Trinity-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Razer-Naga-Trinity-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Razer-Naga-Trinity-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313395" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/netgear-3700-639x430.png" alt="netgear 3700" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/netgear-3700-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/netgear-3700-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/netgear-3700-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/netgear-3700.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-313397" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Corsair-K95-639x430.png" alt="" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Corsair-K95-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Corsair-K95-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Corsair-K95-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Corsair-K95.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
