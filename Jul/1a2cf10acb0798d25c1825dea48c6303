Huawei has announced that its new EMUI 9.1 operating system upgrade will begin rolling out this month for selected Huawei devices.

The number of compatible games which take full advantage of this technology has also increased from 6 to 25, including PUBG, Fortnite, and Kings of Glory. Below are a few of the biggest upgrades coming in the EMUI 9.1 update for South African Huawei users: The EMUI 9.1 update will be available freely to the majority of Huawei’s latest devices available in South Africa, and will be rolled out over the next three months. “As with all Huawei smart devices, customers will be sent a notification of the pending upgrade, which they can then download,” Huawei said. “Once the upgrade is activated, they can start enjoying the many enhancements made to their devices.” The EMUI 9.1 update will roll out to the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, Mate 10 Pro, P20 Pro, P20, Mate 10 Porsche Design, and Mate RS in July 2019.
