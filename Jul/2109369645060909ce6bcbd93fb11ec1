US President Donald Trump is no longer allowed to block people on Twitter, according to a federal appeals court ruling, The New York Times reported. The court ruled that Trump blocking US citizens from following his Twitter account was a violation of the Constitution, adding that his posts were a public forum and he cannot exclude Americans from reading them just because he does not like their views. The three-judge panel in New York ruled unanimously that because Trump uses his Twitter account to conduct government business, he must provide all US citizens access to his posts and allow them to reply in their own tweets. “In resolving this appeal, we remind the litigants and the public that if the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less,” the judge said in his ruling. The US Justice Department stated it was disappointed with the decision, arguing that Trump’s decision to block users does not violate the First Amendment.
