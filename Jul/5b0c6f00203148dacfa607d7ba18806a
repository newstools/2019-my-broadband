By Cheryl Otstott If you have been a frequent reader of this blog you know that I champion our Online Support in almost every blog. I must say I am proud of our Online Support and think it is a wonderful resource to find instructions and help with your Xerox devices and software. We really do want to hear what you think about our online support that is why we give you the opportunity in every solution to let us know how we are doing. Please let us know when we do something right. When you go to the support pages and find a solution that works for you please let us know. All you have to do to rate the solution is to click on the stars rating next to the question “Did this page help?”  Select the number of stars you would like to rate the solution with, 1 being lowest and 5 the highest. We really do look at these ratings, it helps us know what type of cases, and solutions help you out the most. With that information, we can build better knowledge bases that are more helpful for you. Please also let us know your suggestions and comments for what you would like to see added or changed in the knowledge bases or any other information you would like us to know. You can supply us with this information by clicking on the “Provide Feedback” link. Here is an example of what you will see at the end of every solution. I have been talking about these links.
