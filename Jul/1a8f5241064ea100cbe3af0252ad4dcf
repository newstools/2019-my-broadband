AMD has launched a variety of new desktop processors and graphics cards, which it claims are designed to push the limits of gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. The new third-generation Ryzen CPUs boast higher clock speeds and larger L3 cache sizes than the previous generation, and the hardware giant claims the chips are well-equipped to provide a superior gaming experience across both 1080p and 1440p resolutions. These processors also have improved efficiency numbers, offering up to 58% better performance-per-watt for the Ryzen 9 CPUs, and up to 30% better performance per watt for the Ryzen 7 chips. The new Radeon graphics card lineup comprises two pieces of hardware that AMD claims are great value for 1440p gamers – the Radeon RX 5700 and the Radeon RX 5700 XT. These GPUs support GDDR6 memory and PCIe 4.0, and provide up to 1.5-times the performance per watt compared to the previous generation. Rebel Tech told MyBroadband that it expects these new CPUs and GPUs to arrive in South Africa later this week. The specifications for each of the new Ryzen 3rd-generation processors are listed below. Core counts range from four from the Ryzen 3 3200G up to 16 for the Ryzen 9 3950X, with each CPU in the range offering multi-threading. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-312723" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ryzen-9-640x361.png" alt="ryzen 9" width="640" height="361" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ryzen-9.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ryzen-9-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The entire Ryzen 3rd-generation CPU lineup has been listed at local retailers, including Wootware, Evetech, and Rebel Tech.
