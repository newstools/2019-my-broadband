RSAWEB announced that it is supporting the Gary Kirsten Foundation (GKF) on Mandela Day (18 July 2019), as the foundation is building a Township Cricket Centre of Excellence at Chris Hani Secondary School in Khayelitsha. The centre will include an indoor training area and full-size artificial field, and aims to unlock the potential of young cricketers in the area. RSAWEB has been providing free connectivity to schools since 2015, and it is now expanding this initiative to the GKF by delivering free Internet connectivity for all staff at the new centre. “Connectivity will be important as we will be running Township Coach Development sessions at the Centre and our coaches and players need access to online coaching and life skills content to improve their skills,” Gary Kirsten said. “Huge thanks to RSAWEB to coming on board for this project and we look forward to working with them further in growing this partnership.” On 18 July, RSAWEB said it will spend 67 minutes at Chris Hani Secondary School to interact with the children, and for the month of July, the ISP will be holding a collection drive for the centre. The ISP asked customers, staff, suppliers, and partners to provide the following items to support the initiative: The company invited donors to drop off the items at its Cape Town office at Suite 401, The Point building, 76 Regent Road Sea Point, or its Johannesburg office at Block B1, The Crescent East, 3 Eglin Road, Sunninghill. All items collected will be packaged and delivered to Chris Hani Secondary School the following month.
