Nvidia will build its next-generation 2020 GPUs using Samsung’s 7nm manufacturing process, the Korean Herald reports. This upcoming GPU range, which is rumoured to be named “Ampere,” is set to launch in mid-2020, which is when Samsung is expected to launch its new 7nm technology. “It is meaningful that Samsung Electronics’ 7nm process would be used in manufacturing our next-generation GPU,” said Nvidia Korea’s Yoo Eung-Joon on Chiphell. “Until recently, Samsung has been working really hard to secure (partners) for foundry cooperation.” Yoo added that the number of GPUs to be developed with this new technology will be “substantial.” Nvidia is also seeking to buy Mellanox, an Israeli chip designer, and the company confirmed that these discussions are in the last stage of negotiations. The company recently announced new Super versions of its RTX 20 Series graphics cards which offer improved specifications on the same 12nm process node used in the original RTX range.
