Microsoft’s upcoming Chromium-based Edge browser could become the default Internet browser for Windows 10 next year, according to code revealed in the latest version of the operating system’s preview build. Software engineer Rafael Rivera discovered a line of code in the latest preview update for Windows 10 which points to Chromium Edge becoming the new default browser, replacing the older Microsoft Edge browser in Windows 10. This update is expected to launch in March 2020 and will include integration with the new Chromium-powered Edge browser, replacing the older version of Edge. Microsoft’s Chromium-based Edge browser will be available on other operating systems too, with a macOS version expected to be available at launch. The browser is currently available to download for Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and macOS users as a preview build.
