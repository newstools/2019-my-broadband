A known issue in the most recent Windows update has the potential to break VPN services for up to 50 million users. Windows has confirmed that the Remote Access Connection Manager (RASMAN) service could stop working for users who have their VPN profile configured as an Always On VPN connection. “You may receive the error “0xc0000005” on devices where the diagnostic data level is manually configured to the non-default setting of 0,” said Microsoft. “You may also receive an error in the Application section of Windows Logs in Event Viewer with Event ID 1000 referencing ‘svchost.exe_RasMan’ and ‘rasman.dll’.” Forbes estimates that the issue could affect as many as 50 million users, and could pose significant issues for users who need to use a VPN for business-related reasons. “We are working on a resolution and estimate a solution will be available in late July,” said Microsoft.
