Google plans to reveal an overhauled News tab which enhances prominence for publishers rather than headlines. The company stated on Twitter that the new interface will also organise articles more clearly to help users find the news they are searching for. Preview images of the new interface show how stories from highly-ranked publications are presented in dedicated boxes at the top of the results. There are also fewer links per page, but there is more information regarding each story included in the results. The design includes more white space than the current version but also provides less information per page. Google said it would begin rolling out this feature over the next few weeks.
