MultiChoice is struggling to hold on to its DStv Premium subscribers, with thousands of people dumping the service each month in favour of more affordable options. One of the main reasons for this decline in DStv Premium subscriptions in South Africa is the proliferation of affordable uncapped fibre services. Armed with an uncapped fibre connection, or even a highly-capped LTE or DSL service, South Africans can replace their DStv package with a streaming video service for a fraction of the price. The only real drawback is the lack of live sport. DStv remains the only platform in South Africa which offers subscribers access to all popular live sports like rugby, soccer, cricket, and golf. However, many people are willing to compromise on live sport and watch fixtures on free platforms like YouTube after a match has been aired. While South African consumers do not have the same options as their counterparts in the United States, there are many excellent streaming services available locally. Here are the best streaming services available in South Africa, along with their prices and main value propositions. Netflix is the global streaming video leader, making it possible to stream movies and TV shows on your smart TV, game console, PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet, and more. It offers an excellent range of content – including critically-acclaimed original shows – in HD and UHD, and its apps are available on most popular devices. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-272195" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Netflix.jpg" alt="Netflix" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Netflix.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Netflix-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Netflix-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Showmax offers a wide range of international and local shows to South African consumers.
