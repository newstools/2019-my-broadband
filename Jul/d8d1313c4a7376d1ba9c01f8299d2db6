Microsoft has released its earnings report for Q4 2019, which showed a record fiscal year for the company. Revenue for the fourth quarter of Microsoft’s 2019 financial year – which ended on June 30 2019 – stood at $33.7 billion – up 12% year-on-year. Operating income grew by 20% to $12.4 billion, while earnings per share was $1.71 GAAP and $1.37 non-GAAP – increases of 50% and 21% respectively. “It was a record fiscal year for Microsoft, a result of our deep partnerships with leading companies in every industry,” said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. “Every day we work alongside our customers to help them build their own digital capability – innovating with them, creating new businesses with them, and earning their trust. This commitment to our customers’ success is resulting in larger, multi-year commercial cloud agreements and growing momentum across every layer of our technology stack.” “Q4 commercial cloud revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $11.0 billion, driving our strongest commercial quarter ever,” added Amy Hood, executive VP and CFO of Microsoft. Microsoft’s record year comes despite the fact that gaming revenue declined by 10% year-on-year – although Microsoft’s upcoming Xbox system, which is codenamed Project Scarlett, is expected to turn this decline around.
