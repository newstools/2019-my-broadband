Karan Bhatia, Google’s VP of public policy, told the US Senate that the company’s plans to launch a Chinese search engine have been cancelled. “We have terminated Project Dragonfly,” said Bhatia, referring to the code name for the project. Google has never before acknowledged that the project has been terminated, although Google told BuzzFeed that this statement did not represent any new information. Google’s spokesperson referred to previous comments released by the company, which said that the company has no plans to launch a search engine in the country. “As we’ve said for many months, we have no plans to launch Search in China and there is no work being undertaken on such a project. Team members have moved to new projects.” The project was first uncovered by The Intercept, after the publication saw leaked documents referring to Project Dragonfly – a censored version of Google’s search engine being developed for the Chinese market. The project garnered significant backlash by employees and the general public at large, including various petitions for the project to be cancelled.
