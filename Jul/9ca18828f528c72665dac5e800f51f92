Netflix has confirmed that it will launch a new subscription plan which only allows users to stream content on a mobile device. In a letter to investors published on Wednesday, the company said it has been testing this plan in a number of countries, and it will begin rolling out the service in Q3 2019. Netflix said its mobile-only plan will initially launch in India, although it could expand into other markets where the average revenue per user for Pay TV is lower than $5. “After several months of testing, we’ve decided to roll out a lower-priced mobile-screen plan in India to complement our existing plans,” Netflix said. “We believe this plan, which will launch in Q3, will be an effective way to introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market where Pay TV ARPU is low (below $5).” Netflix’s mobile-only streaming plan was priced at $4 per month during testing in various countries. The company did not state whether it would roll out this service to other countries such as South Africa, but said it would “learn more after the launch of this plan”.
