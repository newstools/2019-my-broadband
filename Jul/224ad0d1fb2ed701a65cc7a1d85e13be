Research by Kollective shows that businesses are still not making the transition to Windows 10 at a rate quick enough to be ready when Microsoft retires the operating system. About 35% of the world’s computers still run Windows 7 despite the fact that Microsoft plans on ending its support for the older operating system entirely in January 2020. “Currently, 79% of organizations don’t install updates immediately, and a further 53% wait at least a month before they’re able to install vital operating system updates across their entire network,” Kollective said. It added that while 96% of businesses have started to transition to Windows 10, what truly matters is making the process as pain-free and quick as possible. While Microsoft will release a paid Extended Security Updates (ESU) product that will fix security flaws and vulnerabilities, it will cost up to $200 per device by the third and final year – making it an expensive option for businesses.
