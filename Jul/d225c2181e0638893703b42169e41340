Uber South Africa has partnered with Old Mutual to once again offer financial literacy sessions for drivers on its platform. These sessions are offered at no cost to the drivers and will run on a weekly basis for the next two years. Throughout this period, Old Mutual aims to equip drivers with money management and entrepreneurial skills to help them develop healthy saving habits. The first session took place at Uber’s Green Light Hub in Johannesburg, with a number of drivers attending. “The financial wellbeing of driver-partners is a key priority for Uber,” said Uber South Africa country manager Ndunduzo Nyanda. “We are constantly working hard to ensure we are investing in driver-partners and assisting them in building sustainable businesses.” Uber drivers in South Africa who are interested in attending these weekly sessions can sign up via the invitation they receive via email or in the Uber driver app.
