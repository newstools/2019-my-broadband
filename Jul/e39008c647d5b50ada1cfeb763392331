Google recently unveiled its latest attempt to penetrate the social networking app market – Shoelace. Unlike the recently-cancelled Google Plus, which was an attempt to create a comprehensive social media platform to rival Facebook, Shoelace focuses specifically on event and activity organisation. This positions it as a competitor to Facebook’s built-in Events feature, as it recommends specific local activities – which it calls Loops – that it believes users may be interested in attending. Users can also create their own events, and view and respond to the events of other users. Shoelace has been launched exclusively in New York City for testing and is operating on an invite-only basis. It is available on Android and iOS, and registration requires an active Google account.
