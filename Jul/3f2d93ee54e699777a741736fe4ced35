Vodacom recently launched its new suite of consumer IoT devices and software, which it presented at Vodaworld in Midrand on 10 July. “We’ve built a complete end to end connected solution,” said Vodacom’s executive head of consumer IoT, Saloshni Muthal. As part of this new consumer suite of IoT devices and services, users can access a range of cellular IoT services, which allow customers to access tracking and other solutions through 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. An example of this is the V-Kids watch, which lets parents track where their children are as well as create virtual fences which, if their children leave these areas, the parents are notified. The device also includes an SOS button, which allows the child to notify their parents if something happens to them. Similar services to the V-Kids watch also exist for pets and luggage in the form of V-Pet tracker and V-Bag tracker respectively. Vodacom is also offering security products and services, including the V-Home safety starter kit. This solution allows users to manage and track a variety of important elements within a home or small business environment, such as when a door is opened or when a video camera detects movements. The Vodacom Hub, which powers this system, can also scan the area for other compatible devices, which it can then add to the complete home IoT system. Users can also sign up to a 24/7 alarm notification system, which will notify you or people on your contact list if your IoT alarm system is triggered. To accompany these new consumer IoT gadgets, Vodacom offers a V-Home app, which allows users to manage all of these IoT devices and services from one app. Muthal said that Vodacom expects to continually improve its offerings within the consumer IoT space, including plans to increase the products and services that Vodacom offers. Photographs of Vodacom’s IoT products and services are below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-312951"
