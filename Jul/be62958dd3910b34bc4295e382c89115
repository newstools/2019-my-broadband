Nvidia has launched its “Super” range of GeForce RTX graphics cards. The Super editions of the RTX 2060, 2070, and 2080 offer more cores, higher clock speeds, and in some cases increased memory when compared to the original models. The RTX 2060 Super includes 8GB of VRAM, as opposed to the original GeForce RTX 2060’s 6GB. This, along with other performance enhancements, renders the GeForce RTX 2060 Super almost as powerful as the original GeForce RTX 2070, and more powerful than the GTX 1080 – despite costing just $399. Both the GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2080 Super graphics cards will cost the same as their original counterparts, which makes it likely that they will replace these options entirely. The RTX 2070 Super uses a watered-down version of the original RTX 2080’s chip, while the RTX 2080 Super boasts a variety of improvements over its former iteration, including increased clock speed, more CUDA cores, and more texture units. The RTX 2060 and 2070 Super editions will be available from 9 June 2019, while the 2080 Super will launch on 23 June 2019. South African pricing and release dates for these products have not yet been announced. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
