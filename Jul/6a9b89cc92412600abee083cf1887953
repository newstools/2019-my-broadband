There have been a number of changes to the price of WhatsApp data bundles in South Africa, with the cost of these bundles increasing significantly over the past few years. The price of mobile data is not dropping very quickly in South Africa, and many poor South Africans who cannot afford large data bundles rely on more affordable WhatsApp data bundles. These bundles include data that can only be used within the messaging application for text messages and voice calls. WhatsApp is the preferred mobile communication app for many South Africans, and for this reason it is crucial to most smartphone users in the country that they are able to use the messaging service. Companies including Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C have been forced to increase the prices of their WhatsApp bundles over the past few years, however, making it even tougher for poor smartphone users to maintain or grow their WhatsApp usage. Since the beginning of this year, there were many changes to the WhatsApp data bundle sizes and prices from Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C. Cell C’s 1GB monthly data bundle is far cheaper than MTN or Vodacom’s, but the latter two operators also offer daily and weekly WhatsApp bundles. Daily WhatsApp bundles begin from as low as R2, and customers can buy a weekly bundle for up to R12. We compared the WhatsApp data bundles offered by Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C below. Telkom does not offer users specific social media bundles, but does sell FreeMe contracts and FreeMe prepaid bundles to customers, both of which include free WhatsApp data. FreeMe prepaid data bundles include 500MB of mobile data for instant messaging and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) usage, which includes WhatsApp voice calling. Telkom’s FreeMe contract packages include free WhatsApp calling and messaging, with a fair usage policy of 2GB per month. Other network operators may also include promotional WhatsApp data with various contracts or bundles, and customers should compare value before making a purchasing decision.
