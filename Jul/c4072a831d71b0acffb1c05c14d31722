The Anti-Defamation League’s Centre on Technology and Society has released the results of a survey which found that over 70% of online gamers have experienced some form of harassment. Most of these respondents – around 65% – added that they had experienced “severe harassment,” including physical threats and stalking. 53% said that they had been targeted over factors such as race, religion, ability, gender, and sexual orientation, while nearly 30% reported being doxed. “Online hate causes real harm,” said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. “That’s why it’s imperative for industry leaders and policymakers to take action to prevent this poisonous ecosystem from overflowing and causing additional harm.” Of the games included in the survey, DOTA 2 players reported the most harassment, with 79% respondents who play this game reporting some form of harassment. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, Overwatch, and League of Legends all followed closely behind, with 75% of respondents who play these games reporting being harassed in some form online. The survey gathered information from 1,045 US adults aged between 18 and 45 who play games on a variety of platforms.
