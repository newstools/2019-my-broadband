Raspberry Pi has admitted to TechRepublic that the USB-C charging port on its Pi 4 doesn’t read all charging cables correctly. “A smart charger with an e-marked cable will incorrectly identify the Raspberry Pi 4 as an audio adapter accessory, and refuse to provide power,” said the Pi’s co-creator, Eben Upton. “I expect this will be fixed in a future board revision, but for now users will need to apply one of the suggested workarounds.” Upton added that he was surprised that the issue did not show up in its testing program, which he claims is “quite extensive.” The issue was first picked up by Tyler Ward, who outlined why the problem exists and provided workaround solutions for it in this post. The simplest workaround to the issue is to use non-e-marked USB-C charger, Ward said.
