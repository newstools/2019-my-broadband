An issue with Microsoft’s Insider Programme caused the company to accidentally release a Windows 10 build which was never meant to ship to testers. Windows Central got hold of the leaked build and noted an overhaul of the operating system’s Start menu, which is believed to be the future Start menu for Windows 10 Lite. The new menu is still unfinished and could change drastically before it is purposely shipped to users, but a number of major changes are immediately noticeable. The biggest alteration is the removal of Windows live tiles from the Start menu, with app icons and a search bar comprising the majority of the new menu. It is unclear whether this new Start menu could ship to Windows 10 desktop devices, as it is designed for Microsoft’s Windows Lie OS.
