WhatsApp has released a new beta update for Android and iOS, which includes several small changes and data that points to a major change coming in the future. WABetaInfo has said that WhatsApp is rumoured to be working on a new system which will allow users to use the same WhatsApp account across multiple devices simultaneously. The new multi-platform could allow users to use the same WhatsApp account on iOS and Android devices, and through a standalone app on their computers thanks to the upcoming UWP application. Currently, WhatsApp Web can be used to access your main WhatsApp account on your desktop, but it requires your smartphone to have an Internet connection. WABetaInfo has accurately predicted a number of new WhatsApp features in the past, including WhatsApp Business, WhatsApp for Android tablets, WhatsApp for KaiOS, and a UWP version of the messaging app. This new system is reportedly still under development and there is no estimated launch date. “Note that this is also the reason why WhatsApp for iPad was not released yet, even though it’s ready,” WABetaInfo stated. “WhatsApp wants to give to the user the possibility to use the same phone number on iPad and main device.”
