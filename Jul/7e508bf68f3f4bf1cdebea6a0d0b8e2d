United States president Donald Trump is planning to kill off end-to-end encryption, Politico reports. Sources told Politico that US government officials met last week to discuss the implementation of legislation which would prohibit technology companies from using encryption which can’t be cracked by government. Services targeted by this offensive would include Facebook’s WhatsApp messenger, which enables end-to-end encryption for all chats by default. Officials are reportedly considering either to put out a statement on encryption or to ask Congress for legislation on the issue. If legislation were implemented, this could have severe consequences for security features implemented by device manufacturers and software developers including Facebook, Google, and Apple.
