Taiwanese contractor Quanta Computer will manufacture Apple’s new high-end Mac Pro computer in China, The Wall Street Journal reported. Most of the suppliers for Mac Pro hardware are already in China, which is why the company has opted for this move. Having its production in China will significantly reduce the costs incurred from producing these computers. Apple hasn’t made an announcement on the transference of its Mac Pro production to China, but is expected to do so soon. This decision comes at a time where uncertainty over future sanctions on China from the US has the potential to cause problems for companies from both countries. Despite the US recently lifting some parts of its trade ban on Chinese tech company Huawei, trade tensions remain high between the two countries.
