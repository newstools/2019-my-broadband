Huawei has launched its new Y9 Prime 2019 smartphone in South Africa, delivering flagship features at an affordable price. Speaking at a launch event for the new device in Johannesburg, Huawei South Africa CTO Akhram Mohamed said the device is positioned to compete squarely against Samsung’s new Galaxy A Series. A triple-lens rear camera system is placed on the rear of the device, and there is no notch on the front, with the front-facing camera popping up from within the chassis when it is in use. The Y9 Prime 2019 is the first device with a pop-up selfie camera to launch in South Africa, and Huawei is offering one free replacement of this camera for accidental damage – valued at R799. To protect against such accidental damage, the Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 automatically detects when it has been dropped and will retract the front-facing camera. The smartphone will run Huawei’s new EMUI 9.0 operating system, and is powered by the HiSilicon Kirin 710F chipset paired with 4GB of RAM. Huawei’s Y9 Prime 2019 boasts 128GB of internal storage and supports external microSD storage of up to 1TB. Huawei said the Y9 Prime 2019 has a recommended retail price of R5,399 and is available in three colours: black, blue, and green. The new device will ship from 1 August 2019 and will be available from retailers and mobile operators nationwide. The Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 is now available for pre-order, and customers who order the device from the Huawei Store from 26 July will receive a free Huawei Freelace Bluetooth headset valued at R2,499. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-314351" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Huawei-Y9-Prime-2019-3.jpg" alt="Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Huawei-Y9-Prime-2019-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Huawei-Y9-Prime-2019-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Huawei-Y9-Prime-2019-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
