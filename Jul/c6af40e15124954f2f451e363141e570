Online streaming is becoming increasingly popular among South Africans, with users subscribing to services like Netflix and Showmax which are much cheaper than conventional satellite television. This is further enabled by the availability of Android TV boxes, which support media apps such as Netflix, DStv Now, Showmax, and more. While many smart TVs support Google Cast and platform apps, PC web browsers, iOS handsets, and Android devices are usually first in line to receive support from big companies. This means that if you have an outdated smart TV from a big brand, you may not receive native support on your living room display for certain streaming services. Media boxes provide a solution to this problem, although many available for purchase in South Africa are not Google-certified, which means that many official applications like Netflix and DStv Now are not supported. Google-certified devices offer support for all official apps as well as official versions of the Android TV OS. They also provide great performance for their size and price, and many Google-certified Android TV boxes in South Africa feature similar hardware – namely the Amlogic S905X chipset. This chip allows for 4K video support at 60 frames per second and supports HDR playback. We have listed some of the best Google-certified Android TV boxes available in South Africa, cross-referencing hardware listed at online retailers with Google’s official list of certified products. Below are the best Google-certified Android TV boxes available in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313411" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ematic-4K-TV-Box.jpg" alt="Ematic 4K TV Box" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ematic-4K-TV-Box.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ematic-4K-TV-Box-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ematic-4K-TV-Box-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-272553" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-LIT-Box.jpg" alt="Telkom LIT Box" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-LIT-Box.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-LIT-Box-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-LIT-Box-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312981" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MediaBox-Ranger.jpg" alt="MediaBox Ranger" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MediaBox-Ranger.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MediaBox-Ranger-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MediaBox-Ranger-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312983" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Xiaomi-Mi-S-4K.jpg" alt="Xiaomi Mi S 4K" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Xiaomi-Mi-S-4K.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Xiaomi-Mi-S-4K-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Xiaomi-Mi-S-4K-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312985" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MeCool-KM8.jpg" alt="MeCool KM8" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MeCool-KM8.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MeCool-KM8-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MeCool-KM8-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-285694" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mygica-ATV495-Max-639x430.png" alt="Mygica ATV495 Max" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mygica-ATV495-Max-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mygica-ATV495-Max-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mygica-ATV495-Max-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mygica-ATV495-Max.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
