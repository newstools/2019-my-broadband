Apple plans to implement a new “scissor” mechanism instead of its current butterfly keyboard in the upcoming 16-inch MacBook Pro, MacRumors reports. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who provided the information in a note to investors, believes that this laptop will arrive in the fourth quarter of this year. “The refresh versions of other MacBook models in 2020 will change to adopt the scissor mechanism keyboard, too,” said Kuo. Kuo, who had previously believed that the scissor keyboard design would not be implemented until 2020, believes that the new mechanism will provide superior key travel and better durability. The analyst also believes that the new scissor design will be slightly thicker than the current butterfly model, but most users won’t be able to tell the difference. Other rumours suggest that the new 16-inch MacBook Pro will use a 3,027 x 1,920 display, and will sport slimmer bezels than current MacBook Pro models.
