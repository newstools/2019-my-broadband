Sony is developing a smartphone with a flexible display that rolls up into a compact form factor, according to tipster Max J from AllAboutSamsung. The device could aim to compete with more conventional foldable smartphone designs from Samsung and Huawei, specifically the Galaxy Fold and Mate X devices. The specifications of Sony’s prototype rollable smartphone are rumoured to include a Snapdragon 855 chipset with 5G modem, primary camera with 10x zoom, and a 3,220mAh battery. Sony will reportedly use LG’s OLED display technology for its rollable panel. LG previously demonstrated its ability to manufacture rollable OLED panels in its consumer TV lineup at CES 2019. A recent patent filing indicates that Samsung may also be working on its own rollable smartphone design, with a display capable of extending by up to 60% through a sliding mechanism.
