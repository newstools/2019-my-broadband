The 30% sales fee which Steam charges developers who sell games through its platform is “outrageous”, according to Paradox Interactive board chairman Fredrik Wester. Speaking at a Gamelab panel hosted by GamesIndustry.biz, Wester praised Epic Games’ approach to game distribution, which gives developers 88% of the revenue from each video game sale instead of Steam’s 70%. “I think the 70/30 revenue split is outrageous,” Wester said. “I think the platform holders are taking too much money.” He added that Steam’s distribution strategy doesn’t cost anything compared to physical distribution, but is still based on revenue share used for the distribution of films on VHS tapes. “This doesn’t cost anything. So Epic has done a great job for the whole industry, because you get 88%. Fantastic move. Thank you very much.” Earlier this year, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney issued a challenge to Steam to increase the share of revenue it gives to game developers, stating that if Steam committed to the same 88% share adopted by the Epic Store, the company would stop its exclusives and consider listing its own titles on Steam.
