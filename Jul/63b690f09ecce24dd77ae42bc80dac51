MyBroadband Insights has released its Q2 2019 Mobile Network Quality Report, which shows that people in Gauteng enjoy the highest average mobile speeds. The report is based on 330,596 speed tests which were performed by thousands of MyBroadband Android Speed Test App users across South Africa between 1 April and 30 June 2019. To ensure a neutral testing environment, MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres. The research shows that South Africa had an average mobile download speed of 25.67 Mbps, up from 24.20Mbps in the previous quarter. This large data set makes it possible to look at the network performance of mobile operators at a suburb level. For this analysis, MyBroadband looked at all suburbs where a minimum of 100 tests were performed. The table below shows the average download speed, upload speed, and latency enjoyed by mobile users per suburb. It should be noted that the table includes data from all operators. The average speed per operator can therefore be much higher.
