YouTube Music has rolled out new updates for premium subscribers, including Smart Downloads and new playlists for South Africa. The updates also include new functionality which allows subscribers to switch seamlessly between a song and its music video. Smart Downloads automatically download and store your favourite songs offline to save on overall data usages. This feature automatically saves music at night when connected to Wi-Fi, and up to 500 songs can be stored from the Liked Songs playlist. “Previously, music lovers could use the Offline Mixtape feature to download up to 100 songs, specifically chosen for them based on what they listened to and loved most on the platform,” YouTube said. “Now, with Smart Downloads, users can simply select the number of songs they would like automatically downloaded by toggling their YouTube Music Settings.” YouTube Music also launched several new playlists catered for South African listeners across various genres, including Mzansi, SA House, Afrikaans, SA Gospel, and amaPiano.
