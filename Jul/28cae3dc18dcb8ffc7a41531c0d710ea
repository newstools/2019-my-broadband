Frogfoot has announced that it is rolling out fibre infrastructure in Protea Glen, Soweto, which will cover up to 20,000 homes and businesses. “Providing world-class connectivity has been the main driver behind this project, and we are excited to be the first fibre to the home (FTTH) provider in this area,” said Frogfoot head of sales Shane Chorley. He added that the implementation of this fibre infrastructure will increase access to the internet and can help improve economic growth in the area. “Schools within the coverage area can apply for a fibre link as part of the company’s schools promotion campaign, which gives these institutions access to a free FTTH connection of up to 1Gpbs, with their preferred internet service provider,” added Chorley. The areas being covered as part of the infrastructure rollout are Protea Glen East and Protea Glen West, with Protea Glen West being worked on first. Work on the project is set to commence in early July, and it is expected that the first zone – covering about 1,000 houses – will be completed by the end of September.
