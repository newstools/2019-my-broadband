City Power confirmed on Twitter this morning that it has been hit by a ransomware attack which compromised its web server, databases, applications, and network. Ransomware encrypts everything it can reach from the victim’s machine and holds the information hostage, usually demanding a Bitcoin payment from the victim for the private key needed to decrypt the information. “City Power has been hit by a ransomware virus,” the company said on Twitter. “It has encrypted all our databases, applications and network. Currently, our ICT department is cleaning and rebuilding all impacted applications.” “Customers may not be able to visit our website and may not be able to buy electricity units until our ICT department has sorted the matter out, Customers and stakeholders will be updated as and when new information becomes available.” This has left many Joburg residents who use prepaid electricity without the ability to top up their meters, and there is currently no estimated resolution time for this issue. City Power was first hit with the ransomware virus last night. The company said its IT teams are working to fix the issue and restore the ability for Joburg residents to buy electricity. MyBroadband contacted City Power for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.
