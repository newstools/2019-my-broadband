2019 has been a great year for smartphone fans, with premium smartphones like the Galaxy S10 and Huawei P30 Pro breaking new barriers in the market. It has also been a fantastic year for mid-range smartphone users, with devices like Samsung’s Galaxy A Series and the Huawei P30 Lite providing affordable alternatives which still offer premium features. However, 2019 still promises several new smartphone launches which could shake up the market even more. These smartphones could make big changes to the current and future landscape of mobile devices – be it through their groundbreaking features or their superior value. Here are some of the most exciting upcoming smartphones launching this year. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-309195" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Galaxy-Note-10-leak-1.jpg" alt="Galaxy Note 10 leak 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Galaxy-Note-10-leak-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Galaxy-Note-10-leak-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Galaxy-Note-10-leak-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Leaks suggest that the Note 10 will launch in three versions in the US: a 6.25-inch version, a 6.75-inch Note 10+, and a 5G version. It is not yet clear which of these versions will be available in South Africa. A headphone jack is unlikely to be available on the device, while only the Note 10+ is expected to offer microSD support. The device is expected to be announced at Samsung’s Unpacked event on 7 August. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-296710" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-open.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-open.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-open-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fold-open-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Samsung’s Galaxy Fold was meant to go on sale on 26 April, but numerous device flaws meant that Samsung has delayed the release of its first foldable smartphone. The redesign is now said to be complete, but a second launch date has not been announced yet. The Galaxy Fold will compete with the Huawei Fold in the foldable smartphone market, and will come in LTE and 5G versions. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297184" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-1-1.jpg" alt="Mate X" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-1-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-1-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-1-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Huawei’s attempt at a foldable smartphone will compete with the Galaxy Fold for market share, and also comes with 5G capabilities. It sports a triple camera and an 8-inch OLED display which folds around the front and back of the device. Huawei has delayed the launch of this foldable smartphone to September 2019 amidst issues with the United States. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-301020" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iPhone-render.jpg" alt="iPhone render" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iPhone-render.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iPhone-render-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iPhone-render-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Apple is expected to launch its next range of iPhones in September, but these smartphones are not expected to deliver a radically different design from the current X range. They are expected to maintain a similar aesthetic and are not expected to include 5G functionality. Some leaks suggest that the upcoming range of iPhones could include a square triple-camera system. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-280153" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Huawei-Mate-20-Pro-front.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate 20 Pro front" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Huawei-Mate-20-Pro-front.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Huawei-Mate-20-Pro-front-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Huawei-Mate-20-Pro-front-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Mate 30 Pro is the upcoming premium smartphone in Huawei’s Mate range and, based on leaks from Gizmodo, it is expected to boast a quad-camera system that uses Leica lenses. The same leaks suggest that the smartphone will have 5x optical zoom, with one of its four lenses being a Time of Flight (ToF) lens. Further rumours suggest that the device could sport a 6.7-inch QHD+ 90Hz display, a 4,200mAh battery, and a Kirin 985 processor. It is expected to launch in October this year.
