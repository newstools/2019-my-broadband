Axxess has launched new uncapped fibre products with “no thresholds, no throttling and no shaping” [details here]. The new fibre products are also cheaper than its previous fibre services, which means Axxess is offering consumers superior uncapped services at lower prices. To further sweeten the deal Axxess is giving up to R5000 in value to anyone who signs up for its new uncapped fibre services. “New signups will receive free installation, free connection, a free new fibre router with free delivery,” Axxess said. New Axxess subscribers can also look forward to up to 2 months’ free uncapped fibre access. Existing Axxess subscribers on its capped, home, premium and plus uncapped products can change to the new fibre products immediately through the company’s control panel.
