At an event in Midrand, Nokia Enterprise announced that Westcon-Comstor is its new preferred distributor in Sub-Saharan Africa. As part of this agreement, Westcon-Comstor will assist its partners in realising the full potential of Nokia Enterprise products such as Wi-Fi, SD-WAN, and IP networking infrastructure. “We believe that through our collaboration with Nokia, we will enable businesses to embrace emerging technologies like 5G and help place enterprises at the forefront of industry’s digital age,” said Rentia Booyson, collaboration business manager at Westcon-Comstor Sub-Saharan Africa. Mark Baptiste, director of IP and optical business at Nokia, said at the event that Nokia has made a series of important acquisitions over the past ten years that have shaped the company’s comprehensive business profile. “Nokia is the company with the most complete network end-to-end portfolio,” he claimed. “Nobody can come close to it.” This portfolio extends to mobile, fixed and IP networks, global services, Nokia Enterprise, Nokia Software, Nokia Technologies, and Nokia Bell Labs. Head of Sales at Nokia’s Transportation, Energy, and Public Sector (TEPS) sub-group, Siseko Ngxola, said that of the aforementioned entities in Nokia’s portfolio, Nokia Enterprise is the fastest-growing sub-business. Nokia Enterprise targets four key areas that require particularly high-quality network solutions: He also claimed that while many believe that 5G is a “golden bullet” for entering the fourth industrial revolution, it has been 4G that has already set this process in motion. 5G will, however, build upon the already-impressive enterprise enablement that 4G executes, he said. Ngxola added that the future of the industry relies on high-performance networking, multi-cloud infrastructure, digital value platforms (such as industrial automation and cognitive analytics), and business applications – with dynamic security being a key component in all of this.
