Takealot has announced its own version of popular annual sales like Black Friday and Amazon’s Prime Day. Called The Ultimate Checkout Sale, the event will offer a variety of big discounts on products across the Takealot and Superbalist platforms. The Ultimate Checkout Sale will base its deals on an analysis of behaviour and trends of the 1.7 million Takealot and Superbalist shoppers. “What makes The Ultimate Checkout different is that it is built on shopper behaviour and we are hoping to establish this as an annual event,” said Takealot Group CEO Kim Reid. The sale will focus on deals for Takealot’s highest-rated, most searched for, and most wish-listed products. Takealot said that it aims to make The Ultimate Checkout Sale a South African equivalent to other popular international sales. “Internationally, annual events such as Amazon’s Prime Day, Alibaba’s Singles Day and Flipkart’s Big Billion Days highlight the demand for tailored shopping experiences in addition to great deals,” said Reid. He added that there is a serious appetite for big shopping events from South African consumers. “The year on year growth of Black Friday is an excellent indication of the appetite for big shopping events in SA.” The Ultimate Checkout will run from 24-26 July 2019 and is scheduled as follows: Top-rated tech products on Takealot include the Xiaomi Mi TV Box and the Fitbit Flex 2, while popular tech products in terms of search volume and wish-list presence include the DSTV Explora and Seagate 1TB portable hard drive respectively. Those who make purchases across Takealot and Superbalist over the course of the sale will also stand a chance to win a grand prize of R20,000 in vouchers from Takealot and Superbalist.
