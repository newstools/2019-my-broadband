Apple is testing Face ID and Touch ID sign-in options for the company’s iCloud service, 9to5Mac reports. iOS13, iPadOS 13, and macOS 13 Catalina beta testers can choose to sign into their iCloud account with these two biometric methods when trying to access their cloud service through beta.icloud.com. Biometric sign-in features are significantly more user-friendly than having to type in the appropriate details manually, and also don’t require two-factor authentication – making them popular with users. This new feature, if successful, would likely form part of Apple’s upcoming “Sign in with Apple” feature, which serves as an impressive alternative to the equivalent features for Google and Facebook. “Sign in with Apple” is expected to be launched to the public in September, with developers being provided with the appropriate tools in advance to ensure a smooth release of the feature.
