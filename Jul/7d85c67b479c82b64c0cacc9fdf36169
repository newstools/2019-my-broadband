Apple has updated its MacBook Air notebooks as part of its Back to School promotion aimed at university students. The new MacBook Air devices feature True Tone Retina displays and a lower price tag of $1,099. Apple also updated its entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with Intel 8th-generation processors, Touch Bar, Touch ID, a True Tone Retina display, and the Apple T2 Security Chip. The company has also stopped selling the previous-generation MacBook Air with non-Retina display, as well as its 12-inch MacBook which had just a single port. The refreshed laptops still use Appleâ€™s butterfly keyboard design, which has attracted heavy criticism for its reliability issues.
