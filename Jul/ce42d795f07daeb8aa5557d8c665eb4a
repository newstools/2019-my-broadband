Microsoft has confused its social media followers by releasing teasers for Windows 1.0 – its first operating system which it launched in the 1980s. The tech giant deleted all its photos from its Instagram account and simply uploaded a clip that shows all its Windows OS logos in reverse order. Microsoft has continued in this vein, publishing a photo to its social media platforms with Microsoft software from 1985 and captioning it: “With Excel, Chart, and even Flight Simulator, there’s no telling where Microsoft and the power of Windows will take you this summer.” Windows’ social media platforms have also been replying to tweets about its new social media campaign with a variety of 80s-related content, including GIFs from 80s television programmes and jargon that was popular during the decade. At this point, it is uncertain whether this confusing social media campaign will tie in with Microsoft’s modern software product offerings, or if it is purely a joke designed to increase its social media reach.
