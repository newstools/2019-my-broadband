Microsoft has begun showing adverts for its other applications in the Share menu within its Android apps. Android Police discovered that Android apps built by Microsoft now include suggestions to install other Microsoft apps if they are not already loaded on the user’s smartphone. The report stated that when a user tried to open a file from within a Microsoft app, the application will suggest installing one of Microsoft’s corresponding apps such as PowerPoint and Excel, depending on the file extension. Additionally, when attempting to share a file from within a Microsoft app, the Share menu now includes an option to share using OneDrive, even if it is not installed on the user’s device. Selecting this option would open up the Play Store and prompt the user to install OneDrive on their smartphone. These adverts are only available in some applications on certain operating system builds at the moment, and they do not seem to work as intended on Android Q, with the Share menu displaying the name of the current app instead of the one Microsoft is attempting to advertise.
