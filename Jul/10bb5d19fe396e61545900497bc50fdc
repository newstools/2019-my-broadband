Mind the Speed, South Africa’s newest fibre ISP, is going to great lengths to ensure that its customers will have a top-class experience when using their Internet connection at home. The company, which is set to launch its uncapped fibre products in August 2019, has now completed its Wi-Fi router testing and selected the device which clients will receive when they sign up. Customers will receive a Zyxel VMG3625-T20A Wi-Fi router with their Mind the Speed fibre account, which promises to provide great coverage and speeds. The Zyxel Wi-Fi router will provide wireless coverage throughout a user’s home, supports fast fibre connections, has a simple user interface, and supports zero-touch deployment. Additionally, it supports the 802.11ac standard, is dual-band with 2.4GHz and 5GHz channels, and features a Gigabit Ethernet port. Mind the Speed said that when picking a router for its customers, it ensured the device could handle fibre speeds of over 100Mbps, covered a multiple-bedroom house and penetrated through multiple walls, and was cost effective. This resulted in the selection of the Zyxel device. As various fibre users have different needs, however, Mind the Speed will also offer clients the option to purchase a router of their choice – and they will provide a subsidy. “We are going to offer clients the option to purchase any make or model of router and subsidise the cost. The client will need to order their router of choice through Mind the Speed, and the subsidised amount will be R750,” said Mind the Speed. If a client cancels their account within the first 12 months, they will need to repay the subsidy, added the company. In addition to excellent Wi-Fi coverage, Mind the Speed will offer the lowest prices in the market when it launches in August. Fibre services will be available across the country’s biggest networks at launch – including Openserve, Vumatel, Frogfoot, SADV, and MetroFibre Networx – and more network providers will be added in the future. The ISP will only offer uncapped packages to users and there will not be any fair usage limits on their accounts, said Mind the Speed.
