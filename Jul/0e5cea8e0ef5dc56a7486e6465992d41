Nvidia recently launched its new GeForce RTX Super-branded graphics cards, which boast increased core counts, clock speeds, and performance compared to the older RTX models. South African retailers listed the new graphics cards on their online stores shortly after the launch, with the pricing of these products being similar to their predecessors. It’s apparent that these new RTX Super variants will replace their older models on South African shelves due to their similar pricing, which could leave South Africans with a limited opportunity to pick up discounted versions of the old RTX GPUs. These are still great graphics cards, as they are built on the latest Nvidia GPU architecture and include support for ray-tracing in modern games. MyBroadband spoke to local South African hardware retailers about potential price drops on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, RTX 2070, and RTX 2080. South African online retailers Rebel Tech, Wootware, and Raru told MyBroadband that the original Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2080 are being discontinued in favour of the new GPUs. Big price cuts have already been implemented across numerous products, and retailers said that limited stock would be available going forward. “The ‘original’ RTX series has been discounted down – both GIGABYTE/AORUS and MSI have adjusted down,” Rebel Tech founder Rune Ravnsborg told MyBroadband. “At this time, it does not look like there will be a further adjustment downwards.” Wootware’s Dimitri Mackor said that there should be price reductions on the “non-Super” GeForce RTX 2070 and RTX 2080 GPUs. “So far we have seen price reductions take place on a few brands and series of RTX graphic cards,” Mackor said. Raru’s Neil Smith also confirmed that there have been price reductions on older Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards. Below are some of the best discounts on Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards from the local retailers mentioned above. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-290962" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-RTX.jpg" alt="RTX 2060" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-RTX.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-RTX-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-RTX-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-290664" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RTX-2070.jpg" alt="RTX 2070" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RTX-2070.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RTX-2070-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RTX-2070-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-272667" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MSI-GeForce-RTX-2080-Trio.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MSI-GeForce-RTX-2080-Trio.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MSI-GeForce-RTX-2080-Trio-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MSI-GeForce-RTX-2080-Trio-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
