Applications have opened for the Eskom CEO job which will become vacant when Phakamani Hadebe steps down from the position. Hadebe will vacate his position at the end of July, after which an acting chief executive officer is expected to take over until a permanent CEO is appointed. The new CEO will be responsible for implementing Eskom’s turnaround plan, which includes splitting the company into three separate entities – Generation, Transmission, and Distribution. Apart from having the skills to run a massive company, the new CEO will also need the political clout and connections to manage the relationship with the government and unions. The Eskom CEO position is one of the most challenging executive jobs in South Africa, with the incumbent tasked with rescuing a company with a R450-billion debt and a bloated workforce. The new CEO will have to cut costs at the company in an environment where the mere mention of job cuts can be political and professional suicide. There is a big debate on whether Eskom should bring in new blood in the form of an international expert or appoint someone from within the company. According to Eskom employees, Chief Operations Officer Jan Oberholzer is likely to be appointed as interim CEO, and may also be considered as a permanent replacement for Hadebe. According to the Eskom CEO job ad, the company is looking for the following attributes in its new CEO. Eskom promises the successful candidate a competitive executive-level package which will be tailored to attract the right calibre of applicant. Applications close on 2 August 2019. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-314143" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eskom-CEO-Advertisement.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="557" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eskom-CEO-Advertisement.jpg 654w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eskom-CEO-Advertisement-460x400.jpg 460w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Eskom-CEO-Advertisement-494x430.jpg 494w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
