The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has noted the dissatisfaction expressed by some taxpayers over technical glitches encountered while trying to submit returns. SARS acknowledged that while many taxpayers have experienced a smooth service, some may have experienced difficulties with logging in, not receiving one-time pins, the inability to upload supporting documents, data issues impacting filing, including assessments and tax calculator results. “SARS takes these issues very seriously, and all efforts have been made to resolve them expeditiously and minimise the impact on compliant taxpayers, who want to fulfil their filing obligations,” SARS said in a statement on Tuesday. SARS has apologised for the inconvenience to the affected taxpayers. To date, SARS has had more than six million logins, almost 1.3 million returns requested, and over one million returns submitted, of which 913 474 are for the 2019 tax year. By 29 July 2019, SARS had paid R5.4 billion, with an average turn-around of seven days for taxpayers that had not been selected for audits, and 21 days for those selected for audits. SARS has reiterated that when it opened the latest Filing Season on 1 July 2019, predominantly for electronic filing via its eFiling and Mobile Application platforms, the purpose was to make things easier for taxpayers. “In our endeavour to ensure a smooth service, while maintaining cyber security protocols and staying abreast of technology, various changes were introduced this tax filing season for taxpayer’s convenience,” SARS said. These changes include the following: New security protocols: Introduction of HTML5 technology: An all new MobiApp: Newly refreshed eFiling site: SARS said the process for taxpayers below the income threshold — which was increased to R500 000, with income from one employer and no other deductions — who still want to submit returns, was further enhanced to allow seamless submission by presenting a simulated tax calculation based on pre-populated third party, which could simply be accepted.
