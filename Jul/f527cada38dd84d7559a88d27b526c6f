Slack has begun rolling out an update for its web and desktop applications which greatly improves the performance of its platform. The company has rebuilt the underlying technology of its workspace messaging platform to make it faster and more reliable, resulting in a better user experience. “The Slack desktop app now launches 33% faster, so you can jump straight into your work,” the company said in a blog post. “Calls in Slack are also speedier, so you can join an incoming call with teammates up to 10-times faster. That could mean the difference between showing up to a meeting on time or not.” The desktop version of the app now also uses 50% less than memory and improves functionality for users with unreliable Internet connections. Slack said it would roll out this update for its desktop and web apps over the next few weeks.
