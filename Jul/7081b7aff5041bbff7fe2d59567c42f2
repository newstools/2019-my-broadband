Apple is preparing to unveil its new iPhone range for 2019, but it may be a disappointing launch for Apple fans. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso told CNBC that this year’s iPhone launch will most likely be disappointing, with Apple holding back its cutting-edge features for its 2020 iPhone lineup. Caso said that Apple’s share price could recover after it launched its 5G iPhone in 2020, but advised investors to be cautious about buying Apple this year. “Our call may well be early – we expect this year’s iPhone cycle to be the weakest in years, and today may not be the right time to buy ahead of that weakness,” he said. Apple is expected to launch three new iPhones this year, each being an updated version of the current iPhone Xs Max, iPhone Xs, and iPhone Xr models.
