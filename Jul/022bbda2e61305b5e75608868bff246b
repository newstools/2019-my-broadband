MTN has warned its customers about two fake MTN social media accounts that claim to be official. MTN AWOOF Giveaway and MTN Free Dashout are not official accounts, said MTN, nor have they been endorsed by the company or its service providers. Instead, MTN said that these accounts are run by scammers who wish to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. “We wish to strongly urge our customers not to fall prey to these accounts as they are not official and legitimate MTN accounts,” said MTN executive for corporate affairs, Jacqui O’Sullivan. O’Sullivan added that the company has seen an increase in fake social media accounts where users pretend to be MTN agents and offer to assist customers privately. “We encourage our customers to be on high alert and when uncertain, to verify the validity of purported MTN social media accounts by calling our call centre on 083 808 or by visiting any MTN retail centre,” said O’Sullivan. “Our social media team are in regular contact with Facebook to remove these fake accounts as soon as we become aware of them.”
