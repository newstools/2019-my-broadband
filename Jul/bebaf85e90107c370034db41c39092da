Apple has filed a patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office for a mixed reality headset design under the name “Display System Having Sensors”. According to the patent, the headset includes sensors which offer eye, face, and hand tracking. The patent was originally filed in March 2019 but was published this month. Apple’s mixed reality headset aims to use a head-mounted display “that provides 3D virtual views of a user’s environment augmented with virtual content.” “The HMD may display the frames generated by the controller to provide a 3D virtual view including the virtual content and a view of the user’s environment for viewing by the user,” the patent states. One version of the headset includes a camera, which will be used to capture a direct video feed and enable support for augmented reality applications in addition to standard VR support.
