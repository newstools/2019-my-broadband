If you are a PC gamer, then your mouth is most certainly watering at the moment. Nvidia and AMD have launched RTXs, GTXs, XTs, RXs, 5700s, 2080s, and VIIs all in one year – in a case of there being too much choice for an average user. However, what a lot of cards launching within months of each other means is great deals for consumers. The latest battle for customer share is between: With all this choice for 1080p, 1440p, and 4K gaming rigs, retailers, distributors, and the suppliers will have to look at price drops to get their cards in a gamer’s shopping basket. This is especially true in South Africa, with a price-sensitive market and an economy which is a bit down in the dumps at the moment. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303970 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nvidia-GeForce-GTX-1650.jpg" alt="Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nvidia-GeForce-GTX-1650.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nvidia-GeForce-GTX-1650-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nvidia-GeForce-GTX-1650-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The types of deals we can expect to see as a result of the above are split into two sections. First off, we have the “old” graphics cards which will need to be sold. For example, this recently saw a Gigabyte RX Vega 64 going for R4,999 from a local online retailer – a great price on a powerful card. Unfortunately, in my case, I overthought the purchase and before acting, the deal was sold out. Now, the same Vega 64 is R8,999. AMD RX 580 and RX 570 cards have also seen big price drops in recent months, and you can pick up a capable 1080p and 1440p solution for R3,000 to R4,000. The same is true for Nvidia cards using the “old” GTX branding. GTX 1650 and GTX 1660 GPUs can be purchased for under R4,000 – and pack a nice punch. The second set of deals coming through will be price cuts on AMD’s new cards and Nvidia’s RTX and RTX Super GPUs. The price of the original RTX cards will be reduced to compete more favourably against the RX 5700 and 5700 XT. Price drops for the RTX cards are also likely as gamers will want the new Super versions of the GPUs – not the “old” RTX chips which were launched way back in late 2018. RTX 2060 Super and 2070 Super cards start at R6,999 and R8,999 respectively in South Africa, which means RTX 2060, 2070, and 2080 cards above this price point must drop to compete. Already we have seen decent price drops on high-end RTX cards, and you can now buy an ASUS ROG Strix RTX 2080 for R12,999. This is down from R18,999 in August 2018. The real question now is do you go with AMD or Nvidia?
