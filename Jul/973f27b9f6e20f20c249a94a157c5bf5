There are few things worse in the tech world than when your storage devices become corrupted or inaccessible. As a result of this, highly valuable information stored on these devices can potentially be lost, undermining your business or simply resulting in you losing precious personal photographs and videos. Thankfully, there are options available to recover lost data from damaged storage devices. While there are numerous data recovery services available, PCMag.com’s Editors’ Choice is Stellar Data Recovery – a powerful service designed for Windows users who need to retrieve lost files. Stellar Data Recovery is an incredibly comprehensive software. It can retrieve almost any type of popular file – including documents, photos, videos, and emails. Importantly, this retrieval is not limited to your hard disk. It can also retrieve lost data from other popular storage formats such as USB drives and memory cards. The service has two scan modes – Quick Scan and Deep Scan. Quick scan is an efficient way to recover most data, while Deep Scan is particularly well suited for more challenging recovery tasks such as retrieval from corrupted storage devices. Another awesome feature is the “save scan” option – which allows you to save a scan currently underway, before continuing it at a later date. This means that if you’re on the move with your laptop, you won’t have to restart the scan if you have to move to a new location. Using Stellar Data Recovery is an incredibly easy process thanks to its simple user interface. Once you have installed Stellar, you can immediately initiate a recovery. First, you will be asked which types of files you want to recover. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-311973" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Stellar-1-608x430.png" alt="Stellar 1" width="640" height="452" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Stellar-1-608x430.png 608w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Stellar-1-566x400.png 566w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Stellar-1-768x543.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Stellar-1.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Next, you will be asked to select the locations you want to scan for files that can be recovered.
