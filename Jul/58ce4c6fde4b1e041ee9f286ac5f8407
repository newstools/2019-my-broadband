The latest update for Google Chrome – Chrome 76 – has been released for all platforms today, bringing a number of security and privacy changes. One major change is the patching of a loophole that allowed websites to detect when users were browsing in Incognito Mode. This loophole saw website owners using Chrome’s FileSystem API to check whether browsers were accessing their site using Incognito Mode. Google said that fixing this issue would provide browsers with additional privacy, although it noted that it would make it easier for browsers to circumvent metered paywall detection. Other changes in the latest update include blocking all Flash Player applications by default, as well as various security fixes and developer improvements.
