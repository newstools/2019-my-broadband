The MyBroadband Q2 2019 mobile app ratings revealed that MTN has the highest customer satisfaction rating of all mobile operators in South Africa. These ratings were gathered through the MyBroadband Speed Test App, which gives users the ability to test their network quality and rate their mobile operator. In Q2 2019, 7,451 MyBroadband Speed Test App users rated their mobile operator, giving a good overview of which operators have the happiest customers. MTN topped the list with an average score of 4.24, followed by Rain with 4.04, Vodacom with 3.97, Cell C with 3.56, and Telkom with 3.45. This accolade follows MTN topping the Q2 2019 mobile network quality results released by MyBroadband Insights earlier this month. MTN’s high customer satisfaction score could therefore be influenced by its excellent network quality and good national coverage. Rain also performed well. Considering its relatively poor coverage and declining network quality, Rain’s score is mostly linked to its excellent value proposition. On the other end of the scale, many Telkom mobile subscribers rated their provider very poorly. These poor ratings are a result of the company’s roaming problems and customer support issues, which have been dogging Telkom for years. The table below provides an overview of the average customer satisfaction ratings of South Africa’s mobile operators, along with their respective network quality scores.
