Google is developing a replacement for its Android Beam sharing functionality named Fast Share, 9to5Google reports. Android Beam is an NFC-based sharing technology which was first introduced in Android 4.0. Earlier this year, Google confirmed it would be deprecating this older sharing method in favour of newer technology for Android 10. Fast Share will reportedly be rolled out with Android 10 and would function similarly to Appleâ€™s AirDrop solution. The system reportedly allows users to share files with other Android devices without an Internet connection, requiring Bluetooth and location to be enabled. There is no confirmed launch date for Fast Share, but it is currently available in the Android Q Beta for certain devices.
