MyBroadband’s Q2 2019 speed test and mobile app results show that Supersonic is the best Internet Service Provider in South Africa. The results are based on 32,006 user ratings through MyBroadband’s web-based speed test and its Android and iOS speed test apps. Users rated their ISP after they performed a speed test on one of these speed test platforms. These customer satisfaction ratings are then used to rank South Africa’s ISPs, with an equal weight given to the mobile app and web-based results.

MyBroadband has speed test servers at NAPAfrica’s peering points in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband speed test platform. This testing platform means that there is an equal playing field which accurately measures Internet speed, rather than on-net speed which is the case with other speed test services. The table below ranks South Africa’s prominent ISPs based on the average ratings received through MyBroadband’s web-based speed test and mobile app.
