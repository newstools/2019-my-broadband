Huawei was working with Google to develop its own smart speaker before US President Donald Trump limited Huawei’s access to US tech companies, The Information reports. Huawei had reportedly planned to unveil the new smart speaker in September at the IFA tech trade show in Berlin. According to the report, the smart speaker was going to use Google Assistant’s technology and was set for a global launch – with even US shoppers being able to purchase the device online. However, Trump’s trade restrictions on Huawei reportedly meant that the partnership with Google was promptly binned. Smart speakers have suffered regular criticism over the data they collect, with the likes of Alexa and Google Assistant allowing users’ voice recordings to be heard by Amazon and Google employees respectively.
