Afrihost has unveiled its latest fibre product – Pure Fibre. “Afrihost is introducing a simple, powerful fibre solution that it is uncapped, unshaped, unthrottled, and unmetered,” said Afrihost. “You will get all the speed, all the time, no matter how much data you use.” Afrihost emphasised that the new fibre accounts will have no usage limits – and there are no contracts, or hidden terms and conditions. “The performance of the product will never change according to how much you use,” it said. “Pure Fibre also eliminates complex choices between different variations of uncapped – like Premium and Home.” “It’s one affordable, premium product that gives you all the Internet you need.” To encourage users to switch to Afrihost Pure Fibre, the ISP is offering up to R5,000 in value to clients who sign up. “Clients who sign up for a new Pure Fibre installation with Afrihost will receive free installation and activation, a Wi-Fi router, and up to 2 months free service.” Clients who migrate their existing fibre line to Pure Fibre from another ISP will also receive an equivalent credit for their migration fees, a Wi-Fi router – if needed – and up to 3 months free. “The promotion will cover the items mentioned up to a maximum of R5,000. Afrihost will also cover up to 30 metres of cabling with installation,” said Afrihost. Afrihost said there are a limited number of new R5,000 Pure Fibre specials available, and a R999 cancellation fee will be applicable should clients cancel within 6 months of activation. The specials will go live from 10:00 today, 16 July. For more information, visit Afrihost’s Pure Fibre website.
