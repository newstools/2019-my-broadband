rAge is returning to Johannesburg in September 2019, and ticket prices for the upcoming event have been announced. The rAge expo is one of South Africa’s top gaming events, offering visitors a full weekend of gaming, entertainment, technology, and hardware, in addition to the NAG Bring Your Own Computer (BYOC) LAN. A new logo has also been designed for the event, said rAge senior project manager Michael James. “We’ve had the same look and feel for the rAge logo since we started out in 2003, so it was long overdue for a refresh!” he said. rAge 2019 will be hosted at the TicketPro Dome in Johannesburg from Friday 27 September until Sunday 29 September, and tickets are on sale now from the rAge website. Below are the ticket prices for the rAge 2019 expo: Student and Family Pass tickets will be available for purchase at the door, and tickets for the NAG BYOC LAN will go on sale from 27 July. Gamers can purchase tickets for the rAge expo from the official website.
