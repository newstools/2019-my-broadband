MyBroadband Insights has released its Q2 2019 Mobile Network Quality Report, which shows that MTN has the best mobile network in South Africa. The report is based on 330,596 speed tests which were performed by thousands of MyBroadband Android Speed Test App users across South Africa between 1 April and 30 June 2019. The research shows that South Africa had an average mobile download speed of 25.67 Mbps, up from 24.20Mbps in the previous quarter. MTN had the highest average download speed at 35.90Mbps, followed by Vodacom on 29.76Mbps, Telkom on 23.07Mbps, Rain on 17.91Mbps, and Cell C on 17.32Mbps. MyBroadband Insights Director Marius Hollenbach said there has been a significant increase in network performance from MTN, Vodacom and Telkom in 2019. The increased network speeds are a result of improved LTE coverage and better HSPA availability in rural areas, he said. Rain is the only operator which saw a slump in performance during the second quarter of 2019, which is likely a result of more users joining the network. To determine the best mobile network in South Africa, a “Network Quality Score” was calculated for each network using download speed, upload speed, and latency. The Network Quality Score out of 10 then shows how the network performed in relation to other networks. MTN reigned supreme with a Network Quality Score of 9.78, followed by Vodacom on 8.24, Telkom on 6.16, Rain on 6.09, and Cell C on 5.35. The table below provides an overview of the mobile network rankings in South Africa.
