MyBroadband recently tested the mobile network quality in the North West as part of its countrywide mobile network testing project, including Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom. The MyBroadband mobile network testing project is conducted in partnership with Afristay and Huawei Mobile Devices and provides a comprehensive look at cellular network quality in South Africa. Coverage and data throughput tests are conducted using the MyBroadband Speed Test App, running on Huawei Mate 20 Pro smartphones — the world’s first phone to support Cat. 21 LTE connections. SIMs from Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom, and Rain were installed in our test devices, and performance tests conducted at regular intervals while driving. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure an impartial testing environment. One of our test routes was along the N1 from Cape Town, then onto the N12 after Beaufort West to Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom via Kimberley. Thousands of speed tests were conducted along the route and in the towns themselves. Averages are calculated for the download speed, upload speed, and latency measured in each area. These key network performance indicators are then combined into a Network Quality Score out of 10. Each of the three averages is normalised and weighted according to importance. The weight for each performance indicator was derived from the results of a MyBroadband survey. The survey asked IT professionals how they rate the importance of download speed, upload speed, and latency when choosing a mobile data connection. Understanding the maps below: Each of the red dots indicate a test in that area. Larger red dots indicate multiple tests in the area. Vodacom had the best overall network quality in Klerksdorp, with the highest average download speed of 38.6Mbps. It also tied with Telkom for the fastest average latency of 29 milliseconds. MTN posted the highest average upload speed (15.5Mbps) but narrowly lost to Telkom in terms of download speed (31.6Mbps vs 31.9Mbps). <img class="aligncenter wp-image-312607" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Klerksdorp-scores.jpg" alt="Klerksdorp scores for Q2 2019 MyBroadband mobile network quality tests" width="640" height="1075" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Klerksdorp-scores.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Klerksdorp-scores-238x400.jpg 238w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Klerksdorp-scores-768x1290.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Klerksdorp-scores-256x430.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Vodacom achieved a convincing victory in Potchefstroom and extended its lead compared to the drive testing we conducted in the area last year. It had the highest average download speed by a significant margin (58.5Mbps), highest upload speed (20.3Mbps), and best latency (25ms). Telkom had a slightly higher average download speed than MTN (33.2Mbps vs. 31.2Mbps) but lost second place due to its relatively poor average upload speeds(4.9Mbps vs. 14.2Mbps). Rain also had a good showing in Potchefstroom, placing ahead of Cell C in a solid fourth position. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-312609" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Potchefstroom-scores.jpg" alt="Potchefstroom scores for Q2 2019 MyBroadband mobile network quality tests" width="640" height="1006" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Potchefstroom-scores.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Potchefstroom-scores-254x400.jpg 254w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Potchefstroom-scores-768x1208.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Potchefstroom-scores-273x430.jpg 273w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Thanks to our project partner Afristay, we stayed in comfort while testing the cellular networks in Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp. A relatively new entrant to Potchefstroom’s hospitality scene, the care and attention to detail with which the 2 Owls Guesthouse was built is immediately evident. 2 Owls is run by the owners who built the place. Their breakfast buffet is delicious, the service is excellent, and the rooms and en-suite bathrooms are spacious. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312589" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-Owls-Guest-House-day-Potchefstroom.jpg" alt="2 Owls Guest House in sunlight Potchefstroom" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-Owls-Guest-House-day-Potchefstroom.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-Owls-Guest-House-day-Potchefstroom-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-Owls-Guest-House-day-Potchefstroom-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
