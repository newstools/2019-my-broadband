Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has claimed in an interview with Yahoo Finance that Huawei does not need US companies to survive. “If U.S. companies were to stop supplying us altogether, our production would not stop for a single day in the future. Rather, we would ramp up production,” said Ren. “There’s no lethal risk that threatens Huawei’s survival at all.” Ren also said that Huawei is comfortably ahead of its US rivals, and the US was threatening its own development by banning the company. “Even if they have supercomputers and super-large-capacity connections, the U.S. might still fall behind because they don’t have super-fast connections. Shutting Huawei out is the start of the U.S. falling behind.” Reuters reported that the White House will hold a meeting with various US tech companies, including Intel, Qualcomm, Google, and Micron, regarding the ban on Huawei.
