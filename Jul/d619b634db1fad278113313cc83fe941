Samsung CEO DJ Koh has admitted that he launched the company’s Galaxy Fold foldable smartphone before it was ready, The Independent reports. “It was embarrassing. I pushed it through before it was ready,” Koh said at a media event in Seoul, South Korea. “I do admit I missed something on the foldable phone, but we are in the process of recovery,” he added. Samsung is reportedly testing more than 2,000 Galaxy Fold units and is confident it has now defined all the issues with the device. The company’s foldable smartphone shipped to reviewers earlier this year and quickly encountered “disastrous display issues”, with many recipients experiencing issues with the smartphone’s display breaking and flickering for unknown reasons. Samsung quickly recalled the device to fix these issues and is now set to relaunch the smartphone, although there is still no confirmed release date for the foldable device.
