Microsoft has released its Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 18965 (20H1) for Windows users who have signed up to the Insider programme. This build allows users greater control over applications which restart upon powering up your PC – a feature which has been requested by many users. “We’ve heard feedback that some of you would prefer more explicit control over when Windows automatically restarts apps that were open when you restart your PC, and with 20H1 we’re bringing that option to you,” Microsoft said. This preview build of Windows 10 includes a new app restart setting which, when turned on, automatically saves your restartable apps when shutting down Windows and restarts them next time you turn on your PC. This setting will be disabled by default and can be turned on by toggling the “Restart apps” option under Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. Microsoft is expected to launch this update to all Windows 10 users in the first half of 2020.
