Samsung will launch is Galaxy Note 10 smartphone on 7 August at its Unpacked event in New York. US customers can already reserve the phone ahead of the launch, despite very little being officially known about the smartphone. However, a lot of information has leaked or been rumoured about this highly-anticipated device – giving those who pre-order the device a good idea of what to expect. We’ve outlined the latest leaks and rumours about the Samsung Galaxy Note 10. TechTalk TV has released three photos of what it claims to be the Note 10+ which show a centrally-positioned front camera that uses a single lens. These images also show that the Note 10+ has almost no bezel and no visible speaker – implying that the speaker may be embedded within the display. Images of the Galaxy Note 10 leaked by 91mobiles appear to show that the Note 10 will offer a similar design. These leaked images, as well as reports by Android Police, also suggest that the Galaxy Note 10 range will not use any physical buttons. Techmaniacs claims that the Note 10 will offer a 6.8-inch AMOLED QHD+ display, while the Note 10+ will use a smaller 6.3-inch AMOLED FHD+ screen. The Note 10+ is also expected to have a triple-camera system, as well as a flash and a time of flight sensor next to these three lenses. Techmaniacs said the Note 10 would not offer a time of flight sensor, but would include the rest of these camera features – a claim backed up by the images from 91mobiles. BGR claims that Samsung will not be including a headphone jack with the Galaxy Note 10 range. If true, this will make the Note 10 the first Samsung flagship smartphone to do this. However, Samsung will reportedly offer a variety of solutions for those who wish to use earphones, including support for USB-C headphones and the possibility of shipping the Note 10 with free Galaxy Buds. This Galaxy Bud rumour is accentuated by a leaked image from well-known leaker Evan Blass. This image shows a deal from US carrier Sprint that includes Galaxy Buds and other accessories – such as a Galaxy Watch and a wireless charger – as part of a bundled product. Techmaniacs has leaked specifications for the upcoming Note 10 and Note 10+, which point to both versions of the smartphone using a Snapdragon 855 processor, with an Exynos 9825 chip being implemented instead, depending on the region. This was also claimed by WinFuture, which highlighted that the Note 10 is unlikely to use the latest Snapdragon 855 Plus processor. According to these leaked specifications, the Note 10 will offer 8GB RAM while the Note 10+ will offer 12GB. Both will reportedly offer up to 256GB storage. The leaks also claim that the Note 10 will offer a battery size of between 3,400 and 3,500 mAh, while the Note 10 + will offer an increased 4,300 to 4,500 mAh battery. Both phones will also reportedly feature fast charging, with the Note 10+ offering this feature in a 45-watt version, and the Note 10 offering a 25-watt alternative. The Note 10 range is expected to get an improved front camera, with Techmaniacs claiming that Bright Night mode is likely to be included – as was the case with the Galaxy S10. Other camera features expected to be included in the Note 10 range include live focus video – allowing users to utilise a bokeh effect in their videos – and an audio zoom feature, which allows for the focusing on specific audio input when recording a video. Techradar claims that the 256GB Note 10 is expected to cost around $1,125 in the United States.
