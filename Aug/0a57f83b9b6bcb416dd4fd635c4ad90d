The Apple Card User Agreement confirms that Apple Card will not support iPhone devices that are jailbroken. According to the user agreement, “if you make unauthorized modifications to your eligible device, such as by disabling hardware or software controls, your eligible device may no longer be eligible to access or manage your account”. The user agreement, which was posted on Goldman Sachs’ website, says that users will need a device that has an Apple ID associated with an iCloud account and a valid email address that is associated with their ID. Users will also need to have two-factor authentication for their Apple ID enabled. In addition to not supporting jailbroken devices, Apple will not allow the Apple Card service to be used for payments such as cryptocurrency, lottery tickets, and both physical and digital gambling chips.
