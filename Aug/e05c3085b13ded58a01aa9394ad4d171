Twitter has announced that it will test a filter that will hide offensive or unwanted messages in your inbox. “Unwanted messages aren’t fun. So we’re testing a filter in your DM requests to keep those out of sight, out of mind,” the company tweeted. Up until now, Twitter has offered a quality filter that, if enabled, sorts all new message requests into their own folder, and does not display “low-quality messages” at all unless you disable the quality filter. Now, offensive DMs will still show, but the content will be hidden and replaced by: “This message is hidden because it may contain offensive content.” This will allow users to choose whether to read a message if they recognise the user, or to ignore it.
