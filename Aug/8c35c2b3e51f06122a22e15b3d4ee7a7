Microsoft has announced that its upcoming updates for Windows 7 and Windows 8 will disable VBScript in Internet Explorer 11. This change will be implemented on 13 August 2019 for the aforementioned operating systems. VBScript has already been disabled for Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10. “VBScript will be disabled by default for Internet Explorer 11 and WebOCs for Internet and Untrusted zones on all platforms running Internet Explorer 11,” Microsoft said. “The settings to enable or disable for VBScript execution in Internet Explorer 11 will remain configurable per site security zone, via Registry, or via Group Policy, should you still need to utilize this legacy scripting language.” Disabling this feature means that while Internet Explorer will continue to be offered for compatibility purposes, Microsoft is moving forward with its plan to retire the legacy browser in favour of its newer Edge platform. The company also plans to launch a version of Microsoft Edge based on Google’s Chromium web engine, which would further reduce the relevance of the older Internet Explorer 11 browser.
