Intel has launched its new lineup of 10th-generation Ice Lake processors for laptops. The range consists of 11 new processors – from the entry-level, dual-core i3-1000G1 to a powerful quad-core i7-1068G7. As usual, the processors have been lumped into two categories – the less power-intensive Y-series and the more powerful U-series. These processors are designed to enable high-performance AI, with Intel claiming a 2.5-times increase to performance in this area. They will also boast new Intel Iris Plus graphics, which will reportedly offer double the performance of previous-generation integrated graphics. Another feature highlighted by Intel is its “Best-in-class connectivity” that is able to deliver both integrated Thunderbolt 3 and Intel Wi-Fi 6 – which Intel claims will enable nearly three-times the current wireless speeds. These processors have now begun shipping to notebook manufacturers. The specifications of the new 10th-generation Ice Lake range can be viewed below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315293" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Intel-10th-generation-laptop-processors-640x363.jpg" alt="Intel 10th generation laptop processors" width="640" height="363" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Intel-10th-generation-laptop-processors-640x363.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Intel-10th-generation-laptop-processors-600x340.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Intel-10th-generation-laptop-processors-768x436.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Intel-10th-generation-laptop-processors.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
