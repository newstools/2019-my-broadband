RSAWEB continues to lead the ISP industry when it comes to excellent customer service. This was indicated in a recent MyBroadband customer poll, where the company was rated very highly by its clients. This is alongside its existing 4.3-star rating in Google Reviews, and its 4.75-star customer rating on MyBroadband’s speed test. “RSAWEB is customer-centric, completely obsessed with what our customers are saying and asking so that we can continually provide them with what they need,” said RSAWEB “We invest heavily in improving all aspects of the customer experience, and this includes the continuous improvement of our platforms, processes, and staff skills.” The company said it celebrates its high customer service ratings and this drives it to continue to keep their clients happy. “Customer service is the differentiator in a saturated market. Customer satisfaction is our highest priority – our mission, values, and culture are all geared towards providing this to our customers,” said RSAWEB. “Our great customer service is what makes us unique and our customers have realised this. The proof is in the 5-star reviews we receive from our customers every day.
