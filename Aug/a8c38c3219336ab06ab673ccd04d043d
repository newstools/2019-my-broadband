MyBroadband built a security challenge for the recent 2019 Cyber Security Conference which proved to be very popular among delegates. We now want to give people who could not attend the conference a chance to see if they can complete the challenge. If you complete the challenge, you stand a chance to win prizes worth R5,000, including an Amazon Fire HD tablet, an Amazon Echo dot, and branded gear. If you want to enter the security challenge, you need a MyBroadband forum username. If you are not a MyBroadband member yet, register for free here: The security challenge is posted below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317717" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Security-Challenge-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="906" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Security-Challenge-1.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Security-Challenge-1-283x400.jpg 283w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Security-Challenge-1-768x1087.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Security-Challenge-1-304x430.jpg 304w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
