Ster-Kinekor expanded its Subscription Club to six more cinemas in August, the company has announced. This follows the successful trial of its movie subscription club service at five theatre complexes around South Africa. The six additional Ster-Kinekor theatres participating in the subscription club programme are Sandton City, Cresta, Brooklyn Commercial, Brooklyn Nouveau, Gateway Theatre of Shopping, and Blue Route Mall. Subscriptions will also still be available at the original five trial locations: Eastgate, Watercrest Mall, I’Langa, Somerset Mall, and Garden Route Mall. The SK Subscription Club is available in two variants: the Fan Club for R249 per month, and the MORvies Club for R349 per month. Previously, the availability of these two clubs was restricted to certain cinemas. You could only use your Fan Club tickets at Eastgate, Watercrest , and I’Langa. Similarly, MORvies Club tickets could only be used at Eastgate, Somerset Mall, and the Garden Route Mall. Ster-Kinekor has done away with these restrictions, and all eleven participating cinemas now accept tickets from either SK Subscription Club programme. The Subscription Club offerings are as follows: The four tickets are valid for 2D and 3D movies, and exclude premium showings such as IMAX, D-BOX, Cine Prestige, and special events. For the MORvies Club, up to five 2D or 3D movie tickets per day can be selected. This excludes premium showings such as IMAX, D-BOX, Cine Prestige, and special events. “Ster-Kinekor MORVies Club members cannot make multiple ticket purchases for the same session nor can they purchase movie tickets for any other person. Only the registered member can use the card allocated to them and no other person or third party,” Ster-Kinekor explained. When you sign up for either of the two Subscription Clubs, you commit to a minimum of three months. You can cancel at any time after your initial three months.
