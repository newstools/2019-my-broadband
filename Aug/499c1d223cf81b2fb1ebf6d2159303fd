Steam will launch in China, but under a different name so that it abides by local regulations, reports Technode. The adapted platform will be called “Zhengqi Pingtai”, which roughly translates to “Steam Platform”. Perfect World, Valve’s Chinese partner, said that the platform will be specifically tailored to Chinese users, including “high-speed servers and a high-quality operations team”. Nearly 40 games will be available on the Chinese version of Steam, including Valve’s popular Dota 2 and Dota Underlords games. All titles that will be included on Zhengqi Pingtai are already available on the international version of Steam. In August 2018, China announced that it would be limiting the number of new video games launched in the country to protect children against myopia. However, the country ended this freeze in December, and appears to be open to the gaming industry again.
