Apple has been forced to backtrack on an advertising claim that its products are immune from viruses and related cyber threats. The iStore radio commercial that aired on 702 stated: There are those people: sitting, always fidgeting on their laptops, constantly waiting, charging their batteries, plugging in, plugging out, with the fear of viruses or crashing always on their minds. And then there are the other people: the ones with the single silver slick guy. The Free-from-worries people. The Mac people. The It-just-works people. This commercial did not go down well with one consumer, who lodged a complaint with the Advertising Regulatory Board. The complainant submitted that the “commercial implies that Apple products are immune from cyber threats”, which he said is not true. The iStore responded, saying the commercial is no longer being used, and the new material excludes any references to viruses to ensure no potential ambiguity going forward. The Advertising Regulatory Board accepted the iStore’s undertaking not to use the claim in its future advertising.
