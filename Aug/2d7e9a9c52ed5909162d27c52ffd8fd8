Check Point Software Technologies has released a report detailing security vulnerabilities in DSLR cameras which allow attackers to infect the devices with ransomware. According to the research, attackers can install ransomware on selected DSLR cameras via the Picture Transfer Protocol, with Wi-Fi-enabled cameras being vulnerable to remote attacks. Using this method, hackers could encrypt the files stored on the DSLR’s SD card and hold the images ransom until the victim pays a demanded amount to unlock their data. “Our research shows how an attacker in close proximity (WiFi), or an attacker who already hijacked our PC (USB), can also propagate to and infect our beloved cameras with malware,” Check Point said. Check Point demonstrated the vulnerability on a Canon EOS 80D, and Canon has since released a patch to address the security flaw.
