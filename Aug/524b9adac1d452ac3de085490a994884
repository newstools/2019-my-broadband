Nvidia’s GeForce NOW streaming platform will be available on Android devices, Engadget reports. The service allows users to install PC games on Nvidia servers, and then stream the gameplay to their devices – effectively negating the need for a high-powered gaming rig. GeForce NOW, which is currently in beta, has so far been used by gamers for over 30 million hours of gaming on PCs, Macs, and Nvidia Shield. Nvidia recommends that gamers use a Bluetooth controller if they wish to play games on Android, as most games will not be playable through the smartphone touch screens. The company will also be rolling out new servers in Germany and Northern California, and expects to continue launching new servers in various locations moving forward. These servers use 40 GeForce RTX GPUs, which allows many gamers to use the same server simultaneously.
