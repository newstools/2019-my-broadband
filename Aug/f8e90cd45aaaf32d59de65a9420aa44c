Google has overhauled its Images interface for desktop, adding a side panel and overhauling the search results to aid in purchasing decision. The new interface aims to make it easier for users to compare related pictures. After users select an image, the image will now appear in a side panel next to the results and will stay there as the user scrolls through the page. Additionally, selecting images tagged as a product will now display price, brand, and availability details as well as user reviews. “For retailers and publishers, this updated interface also means people are more likely to visit a web page to get information to help them with a task, or to buy a product on your site,” Google said in a blog post. “Developers can learn more about how to make sure brand, price, rating and availability information appear on product images.” <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315703" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-Images-new-interface-640x376.jpg" alt="Google Images new interface" width="640" height="376" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-Images-new-interface-640x376.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-Images-new-interface-600x353.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-Images-new-interface-768x452.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-Images-new-interface-1200x706.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
