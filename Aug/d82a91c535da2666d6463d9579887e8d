Tesla owner Amie DD has taken the chip within Tesla’s keycard and implanted it into her body, allowing her to access her vehicle with her arm, reports The Verge. To do this, DD dissolved the card in acetone and re-packaged the chip in a bioplastic. She then went to a body modification studio and had the chip implanted. According to DD, the chip only works when it is within an inch of her console, although she hopes that the range will increase as the swelling in her arm decreases. This wasn’t the first time that DD has implanted chips into her body; she previously implanted another RFID tag into her arm which allowed her to open her front door. DD documented her journey on Hackaday, and also published a YouTube video on the process. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
