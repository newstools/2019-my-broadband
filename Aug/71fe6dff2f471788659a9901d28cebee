A recent Vodacom Video Play promotion took many Vodacom users by surprise after they were subscribed to the service without their consent. One of these users expressed his concern after he received an SMS from Vodacom which said “Your free Video Play subscription is now active. Click [Video Play URL] to sign in”. “When I convert my airtime to data, do you guys then subscribe me to expensive subscriptions without my consent?” he asked. The explanation, however, was far less sinister. It was actually a Video Play promotion which formed part of Vodacom’s 25-year celebration. As part of this celebration, Vodacom subscribers received a free 30-day premium Video Play subscription and a 25GB data bundle to stream content. “Customers were able to watch content on Video Play for free during this 30-day period, without worrying about the cost of data and subscription,” Vodacom explained. Vodacom said there was no automatic subscription to the paid-for Vodacom Video Play service. “Customers who wish to continue using Video Play will need to follow the normal subscription process, which clearly outlines the charges that will apply,” the company said. Vodacom confirmed that the free Video Play subscription will automatically terminate after 30 days, and that users will not be billed for the service if they do not pro-actively subscribe to it.
