Mind the Speed, South Africa’s newest fibre ISP, has launched – announcing its arrival with aggressively-priced fibre-to-the-home packages. Mind the Speed is backed by fibre experts with years of experience in South Africa and will only offer users uncapped fibre accounts with no fair usage limits. Fibre packages start at R460 per month for a 10/5 Mbps connection on Openserve, and go up all the way to a 1,000Mbps symmetrical connection on Frogfoot for R1,855. Users who want a fast fibre connection that can take care of all their Internet needs at home will be happy to hear that Mind the Speed also offers a range of packages between 20Mbps and 200Mbps – with a standout example the 100/100 Mbps uncapped package on Frogfoot for R895. To celebrate the launch of its fibre packages, Mind the Speed is offering a range of launch specials. Clients who place their fibre order before 23 August 2019 will receive their first two months free – and 10% off the monthly price for six months. Clients will also receive a range of value-added benefits. These include: Mind the Speed stated that the free installation, activation, or migration will fall away if a user cancels within the first 12 months. It added that a static IP address can be provided to users at no additional cost, unless they are on the Openserve network – in which case a charge will apply.
