Reddit has announced its first live broadcasting tool, named Reddit Public Access Network (RPAN). RPAN will allow Redditors to create live broadcasts and stream video to a dedicated subreddit on the social platform named “r/pan”. Users can view broadcasts directly from this subreddit, and live streams will be curated similarly to standard Reddit posts, with users voting on streams which will appear on the subreddit’s home page. This service is available to all users for a single week as part of a worldwide test, with streaming only allowed between 18:00 and 02:00 SAST every day until Friday. Streamers who participate in this test period are bound by restrictions which prohibit the streaming of NSFW and illegal behaviour. “We’re rolling out the RPAN experience progressively across Reddit starting today, so it’s possible that some people may see RPAN earlier than others,” Reddit said.
