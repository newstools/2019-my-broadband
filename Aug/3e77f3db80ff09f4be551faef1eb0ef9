There was a period where tablets were praised as the future of consumer technology – offering the best features from both laptops and smartphones. However, tablet popularity has waned in recent years, with Google recently announcing that it would stop making tablets altogether. Despite this reduction in demand, many people still enjoy using a tablet for certain tasks, and many manufacturers are still shipping these devices. If you are one of these tablet enthusiasts, we’ve listed some of the best tablets you can buy in South Africa below. The Huawei MediaPad M5 Lite is a great device that offers premium features at an affordable price point. It sports a 10-inch Full HD IPS display and is compatible with the Huawei M-Pen Lite stylus. It also offers users 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, and 8MP front and rear cameras. As its name suggests, the MediaPad is great for consuming video and audio content – thanks in no small part to its four Harman Kardon speakers, which deliver great sound. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305846" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-640x360.jpg" alt="Huawei MediaPad M5 Lite 1" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5E is the best Samsung tablet currently available on the South African market.

Performance-wise, it offers 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage – while also supporting up to 512GB MicroSD external storage. You will be able to take great photos with its 13MP rear camera, and it is an incredibly portable device due to being just 5.5 mm thin and weighing around 400g. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-296164" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-Tab-S5e-1-639x430.png" alt="Galaxy-Tab-S5e-1" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-Tab-S5e-1-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-Tab-S5e-1-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-Tab-S5e-1-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galaxy-Tab-S5e-1.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Apple has traditionally been a favoured player in the tablet space with its iPad devices, which offer great performance and stylish looks. The iPad Pro – Apple’s flagship tablet – offers up to 1TB storage space, dwarfing the figures offered by the others on this list. It sports a 12.9-inch, 2,732 x 2,048 LED display with IPS technology, and it can record 4K 60FPS video with its 12MP camera while simultaneously taking 8MP photographs. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-282597" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Apple-iPad-Pro-2.jpg" alt="Apple iPad Pro 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Apple-iPad-Pro-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Apple-iPad-Pro-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Apple-iPad-Pro-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Lenovo is one of the few genuine competitors to the three giants of mobile device manufacturing. Its Yoga Book tablets are high-quality devices and offer something different for those who want more functionality out of their tablet. The Yoga Book C930 functions as a 2-in-1 device, with a second touch screen that can be used as a second display or as a keyboard. It runs Windows 10 Home and has an Intel Core i5 processor. The C930 also has 4GB RAM and a 256GB SSD – offering laptop-grade specifications in a tablet’s form factor. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-274091" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lenovo-Yoga-Book-C930-1.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga Book C930 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lenovo-Yoga-Book-C930-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lenovo-Yoga-Book-C930-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lenovo-Yoga-Book-C930-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
