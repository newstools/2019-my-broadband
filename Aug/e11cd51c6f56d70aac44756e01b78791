Apple’s controversial decision to block the Battery Health feature on iPhones with batteries installed by uncertified technicians is implemented for safety reasons, the company said. iFixit highlighted this new functionality on iPhones last week, and claimed that it was happening regardless of whether the battery was a genuine Apple battery or a third-party alternative. “Unless an Apple Genius or an Apple Authorized Service Provider authenticates a battery to the phone, that phone will never show its battery health and always report a vague, ominous problem,” said iFixit. Speaking with The Verge, Apple said that the warning is to inform customers that it cannot verify a new and genuine battery was installed by the technician. “We take the safety of our customers very seriously and want to make sure any battery replacement is done properly,” said an Apple spokesperson. “This information is there to help protect our customers from damaged, poor quality, or used batteries which can lead to safety or performance issues.” Apple also confirmed that the notification does not affect the customer’s ability to use the phone.
