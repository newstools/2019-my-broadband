Microsoft is expected to launch its upcoming dual-screen Surface laptop on 2 October at an event in New York City, Softpedia News reports. The company is believed to have been working on a dual-screen Surface for years, with the rumoured product offering the same 2-in-1 tablet design as traditional Surface devices enhanced with an additional screen for added productivity. Previous reports have indicated that the upcoming device could sport a pair of 9-inch screens, both of which will have a 4:3 aspect ratio. The report noted that while the dual-screen Surface could be announced at the launch event on 2 October, it might not go on sale until some time in 2020. In addition to pulling back the curtain on its rumoured dual-screen device, Microsoft is also expected to launch a hardware refresh for Surface Book and Surface Laptop devices.
