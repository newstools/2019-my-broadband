Uber is investigating an attack on one of its riders where the driver may have been involved in helping criminals to lure an unsuspecting rider into an ambush. The rider explained that he ordered an Uber at night, but that the driver apparently could not find his location. The Uber driver told the victim he was at the pickup point, despite the fact that he did not arrive where the rider was waiting. The driver then asked the victim to walk to another location where he was apparently waiting, but he was also not there. While the rider walked around the area trying to find the Uber car, he was mugged and had his phone stolen. The rider reported the incident to Uber, and the company is now investigating the driver and the criminal activity. “What has been reported has no place on the Uber app. We have reached out to the rider to offer our support and to look into the matter,” an Uber spokesperson told MyBroadband. “In any case of this nature, we remove a driver’s access to the app while we investigate,” Uber added. To help South Africans to keep themselves safe, Uber advised riders to remember the following tips when requesting a trip: “We have a dedicated Safety Response Team who investigate all incidents reported to Uber,” the company said. It added that its Law Enforcement Relations Team (LERT) is on call to work with police at any time to respond to urgent needs and walk them through how Uber can assist in an investigation.
