Samsung revealed its new Galaxy Book S portable laptop at its Unpacked event in New York. This new mobile computing device aims to deliver high-end performance in a highly portable form factor and offers Gigabit LTE connectivity paired with Windows 10. The Galaxy Book S is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx chipset and features an ultra-slim chassis which weighs only 0.96kg. “Galaxy Book S combines the best mobility features Samsung has to offer with Microsoft’s leading productivity solutions and Qualcomm Technologies’ performance capabilities to deliver the best mobile productivity experience available in a mobile device today,” said Samsung Electronics CEO DJ Koh. Compared to the Galaxy Book 2, the Galaxy Book S delivers 40% greater CPU performance and 80% better graphics performance in addition to offering more memory bandwidth. Samsung said its Galaxy Book S would be available in two colours – Earthy Gold and Mercury Gray – and would launch later this year in selected markets. There is currently no pricing available for the Samsung Galaxy Book S. The company also launched its new Galaxy Watch Active 2 in partnership with Under Armour. This wearable is designed specifically for runners and includes a suite of features which aim to improve the owner’s running experience. These new features include an always-on running coach, integration with MayMyRun, and a redesigned aluminium body available in two sizes – 44mm and 40mm. Samsung said the Galaxy Watch Active 2 would be available from 27 September 2019, but did not provide any pricing for the new device. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315869" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-1.jpg" alt="Galaxy Book S 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315871" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-2.jpg" alt="Galaxy Book S 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315873" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-3.jpg" alt="Galaxy Book S 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315875" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-4.jpg" alt="Galaxy Book S 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Book-S-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315879" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-1.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch Active 2 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315881" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-2.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch Active 2 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315883" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-3.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch Active 2 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315885" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-4.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch Active 2 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Watch-Active-2-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
