Nvidia recently launched its new Super range of GeForce RTX graphics cards, which offer improved performance compared to the previous-generation lineup. The RTX 2060 Super offers more memory than the original RTX 2060, and is nearly as powerful as the original RTX 2070. Both the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super graphics cards have a similar price to the cards they replace, despite their improved performance. AMD also recently launched new two new GPUs: the Radeon RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT, which compete with the RTX 2060 and RTX 2070 GPUs respectively. At a press conference that showcased these new cards, AMD claimed that the RX 5700 XT was capable of outperformingÂ the GeForce RTX 2070 by 20fps in 1440p gaming. Both cards offer 8GB GDDR6 memory and support 4K HDR content at 144Hz. G3D Mark displays the benchmark figures for the leading high-end graphics cards typically used by gamers.
