Openview has announced that it will no longer be carrying Kwesè Free Sports, which was aired on channel 115 on its satellite platform offering. The channel lost its broadcast signal on Openview on Sunday 28 July and technical efforts to restore its connectivity proved to be unsuccessful, the company said. “Due to unforeseen technical difficulties, we have been unable to restore our channels in a satisfactory state at this time. We understand that this is disappointing and apologise for the inconvenience,” said Econet Media CEO Joe Hundah. The Kwesè Free Sports channel had been running since March 2018 and had rights for sports leagues such as the NBA, Formula E, and WTA Miami Masters. “Providing our audience with a sports channel was a significant achievement for us on the platform channel offerings and the dissolution of the Kwesè Free Sports channel has been a tremendous loss, not only for us as Openview, but most importantly, for the audiences that we serve,” said Openview’s head of channel acquisitions, Ziyanda Mngomezulu. Kwesè Play also recently announced that it would be entering liquidation, leaving owners of the service’s customised Roku streaming devices without any use for this hardware.
