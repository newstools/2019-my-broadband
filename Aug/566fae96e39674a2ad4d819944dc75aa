For many years South Africans have asked for affordable data packages from mobile operators, and over the last few months, this is exactly what has been offered. Telkom recently launched its Big Deal for August 2019, offering subscribers 20GB Anytime and 20GB Night Surfer LTE data for R249 per month. MTN has an even better deal. The operator recently unveiled its 80GB Mega Deal, which offers subscribers 40GB anytime data and 40GB Night Express data for R299 per month. For those looking for a smaller data package, MTN is also offering a 10GB + 10GB package for R149 per month and a 20GB + 20GB service for R199 per month. MTN’s data deals mirror Vodacom’s “Red Hot Deal” promotions which are available until 6 August 2019. Not to be outdone, Cell C is offering subscribers 10GB anytime data and 10GB Night Express data for R129 per month.
