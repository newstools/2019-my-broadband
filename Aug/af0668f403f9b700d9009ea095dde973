Samsung launched its new Galaxy Note 10 at a special Unpacked event in New York, announcing two variants of its premium flagship smartphone. The smartphone manufacturer unveiled a smaller model named the Galaxy Note 10 and a 6.8-inch monster named the Galaxy Note 10+. Both devices boast high-end hardware, including AMOLED displays, quad-lens camera systems, and the Note range’s signature S-Pen. Shipping two Note 10 models allows Samsung to pack the larger device with an impressive 4,300mAh battery as well as 45W Quick charging, while also offering a more affordable and portable device for traditional flagship users. The most apparent change with the new Galaxy Note 10 is its cutout front camera design, which trades the traditional notch for a similar design to the Galaxy S10. Samsung has centered the front-facing camera on the Note 10 however, and it has also slimmed down the device’s chassis compared to the previous generation. Both models boast high-resolution displays that are almost bezel-less, as wall as quad-lens rear camera systems which include a 3D time-of-flight lens to improve bokeh and zoom features. The S-Pen has been improved once again for the Galaxy Note 10, and now offers the ability to control smartphone functions without touching the screen via Air Gestures, as well as switch camera lenses remotely. New camera features deliver live bokeh for video recording, and the 7nm chipset in the new Note 10 provides considerably faster performance compared to previous-generation smartphones. Both Galaxy Note 10 models include an in-screen fingerprint sensor and IP68 water and dust resistance. Below are the full specifications of the new Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315827" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-1.jpg" alt="Galaxy Note 10 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-Note-10-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Samsung South Africa confirmed that both models of the Galaxy Note 10 will be available in South Africa from 30 August 2019 in three colours – Aura Glow, Aura Black, and Aura White.
