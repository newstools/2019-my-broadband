Samsung has launched its Galaxy Tab S6, which serves as competition for Apple’s iPad Pro. “Today’s inspiration comes at a moment’s notice and creatives and professionals need a device able to keep up with insatiable imaginations while complementing their busy, on-the-go lifestyles,” said DJ Koh, CEO of the IT division at Samsung Electronics. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 features a 10.5-inch Super AMOLED display, and will include quad speakers powered by AKG and Dolby Atmos. It is powered by a 7nm octa-core Snapdragon 8150 processor and offers up to 8GB memory and 256GB storage space, with an additional 1TB of storage available through a MicroSD slot. The Galaxy Tab S6 will also feature an improved, dual-lens camera system that will include an ultra-wide lens – the first time this has been offered on a Samsung tablet. It will also have an on-screen fingerprint scanner and an improved version of Samsung DeX – the feature that allows users to transition their tablet into a PC-like experience. Neither South African pricing nor a local launch date have been announced.
