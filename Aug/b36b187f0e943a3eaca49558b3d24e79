MTN has announced the launch of its revamped premium MTN Sky mobile plans – MTN Sky, MTN Sky VIP, and MTN Sky Black. These packages offer unlimited calls, unlimited SMSs, and more inclusive data value compared to previous Sky packages. Customers will get a double-up on Night Express and Anytime Data, and will continue to benefit from Entertainment Pass 14GB and 20GB Anytime once-off data on MTN Sky and Sky VIP plans. The only difference between the three new MTN Sky packages is the amount of data available to subscribers. “We are very excited about the revamped MTN Sky offerings, which was based on the realisation that our customers deserve the very best in the market,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA. “MTN Sky offers flexibility, choice and added-value, and gives our customers the opportunity to select a premium package that is most suited to their needs, usage and individual lifestyles.” The new MTN Sky plans are listed below.
