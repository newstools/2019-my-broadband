Google has launched a new feature which allows Android smartphone users to sign in to some Google services using the fingerprint sensor on their device instead of entering their password. According to a support page on the company’s website, Android users can now use their smartphone’s screen lock sign-in interface to verify their identity when logging in to Google services on another device. This online smartphone authentication has begun rolling out today, and it also brings the ability to verify your identity by using a PIN and screen unlock pattern. To use this feature, Android smartphone users will need to update their Google Play Services application and enable the functionality in their Android smartphone settings. This change is part of Google’s strategy to reduce reliance on passwords and shift to more secure two-factor authentication methods.
