The big fibre battle in South Africa is in full swing, with fibre network operators rapidly growing their networks and ISPs fighting for the hearts and wallets of consumers. In recent weeks, Afrihost launched its Pure Fibre products, Axxess unveiled its new uncapped fibre products, and RSAWEB launched its Fibre Fiesta promotion. These deals offer subscribers uncapped, unshaped, unthrottled, and unmetered fibre services at affordable prices. To sweeten their specials, many ISPs are offering subscribers free installation, free activation, and even free Internet access for the first two months. With prices starting at R399 for an uncapped fibre connection, it is no surprise that fibre-to-the-home is killing ADSL. Many ISPs have also slashed the prices of their high-end fibre-to-the-home packages in recent months. RSAWEB, for example, launched a new 1Gbps uncapped fibre product for home users at R1,395 per month. The best deal, however, remains Cybersmart Lightspeedâ€™s 500Mbps uncapped fibre-to-the-home service for R899 per month. What makes this product unique is that subscribers can change their download and upload speed ratio through an online portal in real-time. Cybersmart CTO Laurie Fialkov told MyBroadband that this uncapped product is so popular that it is terminating all its other products. Going forward Cybersmart will therefore only offer a single product, as it offers its clients the best value-for-money. The table below provides an overview of the best high-end uncapped fibre-to-the-home products which were launched or saw price cuts in recent weeks.
