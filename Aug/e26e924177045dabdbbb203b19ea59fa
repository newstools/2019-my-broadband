Windows Server 2008 users, it is time to upgrade. Support for Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will end on 14 January 2020, and organisations which do not upgrade before then will face security risks and other operational issues. End of support for Windows Server 2008 means that regular security updates will end – and your IT infrastructure and applications will go unprotected, putting your business at risk. Pinnacle can assist you to upgrade to Windows Server 2019 and keep your operations secure, while providing support and guidance throughout the migration process. Pinnacle is also able to provide you with guidance on the hardware requirements for Windows Server 2019 on brands such as DellEMC, Supermicro, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Huawei. “To take full advantage of modern security, performance, and efficiency features, running Windows Server 2019 on modern servers is recommended,” states Pinnacle. Upgrading to Windows Server 2019 provides multiple benefits to users beyond standard security updates. Windows Server 2019’s enhanced security protects the identity, operating system, and virtualization layers to disrupt attacks and isolate vulnerable targets. This support is continuing until at least 2023. Windows Server 2019 also provides for scalable and hardware-agnostic storage, networking, and compute – all from a single interface. Further justifying the upgrade is the fact that Windows Server 2008 is limited to 64 logical processors, which is insufficient for modern business operations.
