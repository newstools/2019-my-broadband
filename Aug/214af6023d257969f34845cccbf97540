Apple and Spotify are in talks to allow users to access Spotify through Siri, The Information reports. According to the report, Apple Music would still be the default music playing platform for Apple users, but Spotify would be accessible too if the user specifically requests it. Spotify has previously complained to European competition entities over the fact that Spotify was blocked from communicating with Siri. The music streaming company’s issues with Apple are not limited to this, however, with a variety of other battles taking place between the two companies. Most recently, Spotify asked the European Union to look into Apple’s fees for App Store vendors, which it claimed were exorbitant. Apple replied by saying that the music streaming giant wants all the benefits of its app store without contributing to the marketplace. It is unclear whether this battle has been resolved, but it appears the two companies are finally seeing eye-to-eye on at least one topic.
