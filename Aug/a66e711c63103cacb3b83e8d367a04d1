Facebook has begun the rollout of its Clear History tool to three countries, and plans to expand this to more regions in the coming months, reports The Verge. The Clear History tool is rolling out in Ireland, South Korea, and Spain, and will afford users more opportunities to protect their data from advertisers. The tool was originally announced in mid-2018 at the Facebook Developer Conference and was expected to launch later that year, but a series of delays have meant that the release of the tool is only beginning now. When it is available in South Africa, the tool will be part of a new section of Facebook that is called “off-Facebook activity,” and will allow users to see which apps and websites are tracking their data and using it for targeted ad purposes on Facebook. The tool will also allow users to block these companies from reporting on their data in the future. Facebook came under heavy fire last year after data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica was found to be storing millions of users’ data in violation of Facebook’s rules.
