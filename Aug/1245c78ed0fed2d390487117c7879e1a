LG has teased a smartphone with three screens ahead of its September press conference at IFA 2019. The company released a short trailer which begins with a customised version of Pacman being played on a smartphone. Next, a second, fold-out screen shows directions to the company’s September presentation. An LG fold-out display is already available as a V50 ThinQ screen case accessory. What is new, however, is a third, smaller display on the front of the device – which in the video highlights the 6 September date of the company’s IFA presentation. It is unclear whether this product will be implemented as a standalone smartphone, however, as LG has shown little intention of entering the foldable smartphone market. The product could be an improvement on the aforementioned screen case accessory, which can turn your smartphone into a triple-screen device. It is uncertain whether such an accessory would be compatible with the current V50 ThinQ or a future device. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
