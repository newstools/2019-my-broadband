Huawei is developing a collection of new smartphone cases which can connect wirelessly to its smartphones to provide new functionality. A Bluetooth SIG listing filed by the company describes these accessories as “smart devices” which will connect to the host device via Bluetooth. This means the company could create products like smartphone cases which turn compatible devices into handheld gaming systems. It is currently unclear which devices would offer support for these modular cases, and the lineup may also include compatible Honor smartphones in addition to Huawei products. Huawei has not yet revealed any information regarding the potential applications of these modular accessories.
