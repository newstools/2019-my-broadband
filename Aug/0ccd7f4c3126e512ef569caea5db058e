Huawei South Africa has announced that it will launch new Android smartphones with licensed Google apps in South Africa. The two smartphones – the Huawei Y9 S and Nova ST – will launch before the end of the year, and will include high-end features and impressive camera technology. “The Nova 5T is part of Huawei’s new trend-setting series of phones and comes with five AI cameras – a 48-megapixel quad AI camera setup in the rear, and a 32-megapixel selfie camera,” said Huawei. “The Y9 S is an upgrade on the recently released Y9 Prime 2019, which will have an enhanced design and even more innovative technology.” This follows after Google confirmed that Huawei’s upcoming Mate 30 smartphone would not ship with licensed Google applications. Despite this news, Huawei South Africa said it remains committed to continue using the Android operating system on all of its smartphones. “Huawei wants to maintain one standard and one ecosystem for our smartphones,” said Huawei CBG South Africa vice president Likun Zhao. “Huawei’s first priority, as always, is the experience of our users and giving them excellent quality products.”
