Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft will all require that game publishers show the drop rates of items in their games, TechRadar reports. This is in alignment with an initiative that was presented at the Entertainment Software Association’s (ESA) presentation at an FTC workshop on 7 August. “These required disclosures will also apply to game updates if the update adds new loot box features. The precise timing of this disclosure requirement is still being worked out, but the console makers are targeting 2020 for the implementation of the policy,” said the ESA in a statement. The ESA added that the requirement will apply to all new games, as well as to updates to games that add loot box or equivalent odds-based features. Publishers who have already committed to the initiative include Activision Blizzard, Bethesda, EA, and Ubisoft. The initiative will come into effect in 2020, and it is unclear whether games that already use loot box features – such as Overwatch – will be required to comply.
