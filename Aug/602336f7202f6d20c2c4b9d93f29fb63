ASUS recently launched its new lineup of notebooks in South Africa, including refreshed VivoBook and ZenBook devices. All these devices feature ASUS ScreenPad 2.0 technology, which integrates a touchscreen LCD into the laptops’ trackpads for added functionality. The company took this design one step further, however, with its new ZenBook Pro Duo – the flagship notebook in its lineup. The ZenBook Pro Duo boasts a second touchscreen display above its keyboard called the ScreenPad Plus, as well as a separate trackpad to the right of its physical keyboard which also doubles as a number pad. Windows 10 detects the ScreenPad Plus panel as a second touchscreen display, allowing you to run multiple applications side-by-side and extend full-screen applications from your primary display to the second screen. ASUS sent MyBroadband a review unit of the ZenBook Pro Duo to use, and we were really impressed with what it had to offer. The ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo is truly a flagship laptop, boasting up to an Intel Core i9 processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card. These high-end specifications, paired with a slim and light chassis, make the ZenBook Pro Duo a great device for gamers and professionals alike. The dual-display setup further allows for improved productivity as well as increased multitasking capabilities, and the touchscreen functionality on both panels further enhances the user experience across all applications. Included in the box with the ZenBook Pro Duo is a free-standing wrist wrest for the keyboard and a stylus for use with the ScreenPad Plus display and 4K OLED main panel. The specifications of the ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo provided to us for review are listed below. It takes a moment to adjust to the extra display sitting above the keyboard on the ZenBook Pro Duo, but once you do, it is difficult to move away from this amazing feature. The laptop’s hardware easily drives multiple applications over both high-resolution displays, and the picture quality for videos and games on the primary 4K OLED screen is incredibly detailed and vivid. Using the ZenBook Pro Duo for everyday tasks is a pleasure, too, with the second display being perfectly sized for secondary apps such as Notepad and Spotify, or for instant messengers. The experience is similar to using two monitors on a desktop PC, but with the added benefit of being able to use both panels as touchscreens. If you use your laptop for extended periods of time and rely heavily on multitasking, you will soon find the ScreenPad Plus an indispensable tool. The digital trackpad is also a great solution, and you can easily toggle the number pad on or off by using a small button in the top-right corner of its matte surface. Complementing the impressive hardware and displays is a sleek, brushed aluminium case with a low-profile design. A complaint we have encountered from laptop users in the past is that they buy a high-end unit, but must still make do with a plastic chassis. ASUS has circumvented this by housing the ZenBook Pro Duo in a light aluminium frame. This makes it both strong and pleasant to hold. This further ensures the laptop feels solid when you use it – indicative of a high-quality design. The slim, portable form factor of the ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo paired with its amazing dual-screen setup and powerful hardware make it one of the best laptops on the market right now, whether you’re a hard-working professional or a serious gamer looking for a desktop replacement.
