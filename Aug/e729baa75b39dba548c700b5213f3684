Gartner predicts that revenue from worldwide 5G wireless network infrastructure will reach $4.2 billion in 2020 – an 89% increase from the expected 2019 figure of $2.2 billion. “5G wireless network infrastructure revenue will nearly double between 2019 and 2020,” said Sylvain Fabre, senior research director at Gartner. “For 5G deployments in 2019, Communications Service Providers (CSPs) are using non-standalone technology. This enables them to introduce 5G services that run more quickly, as 5G New Radio (NR) equipment can be rolled out alongside existing 4G core network infrastructure.” In contrast, CSPs will roll out standalone 5G technology in 2020, predicts Gartner, which will lower costs for these providers and improve performance for users. Gartner also believes that 5G NR network infrastructure will account for 6% of the total revenue of CSPs in 2019, and predicts that this will increase to 12% in 2020. 7% of network operators worldwide have already deployed 5G infrastructure, Gartner estimates.
