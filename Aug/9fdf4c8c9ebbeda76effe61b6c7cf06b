WhatsApp has launched a new update for the beta version of its iOS application, WABetaInfo reports. The messaging app has now added support for Memoji stickers, which are compatible with iPhone X, Xr, and Xs devices running iOS 13. Memoji are customisable characters which can be designed by users to mirror their features and facial expressions. As it did with its Android beta update, WhatsApp has also added the “WhatsApp from Facebook” label to certain fields across the app interface. These features will be available to all users in the official 2.19.90 update, available on the App Store.
