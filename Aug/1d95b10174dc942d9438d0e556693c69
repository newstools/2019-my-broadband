RSS Security Services is now using virtual reality (VR) to show South Africans how to protect themselves against crime and train their staff. RSS Security Services CEO Brett Fisher told MyBroadband that VR is a great tool to help their clients to understand security risks and how they can improve their security. “I find that our VR users are totally immersed in the content which means they have fewer distractions and pay more attention to the message that we try to deliver,” said Fisher. “This improved understanding empowers our clients to develop and maintain their security improvement plans within the constraints of their budgets.” RSS Security Services is also using VR to improve their guard and management training and prepare their staff for real-world crime situations. Guards are not often confronted by contact with criminals, which means they are not always well-prepared to make the right decisions when they come face-to-face with intruders. By using VR, RSS Security Services is placing their guards in these situations and preparing them to make the best decision in each situation. “Our guarding and support staff are better trained and more effective than our competitors, and VR helps us to maintain and even extend that competitive edge,” said Fisher. RSS Security Services has made its VR project for estates available, which provides insight into what is needed to secure a typical fenced community. Fisher explained that there are two golden rules for effective guarding security – tight access control and a secure perimeter. “This VR project includes videos, pictures, and explanations to help any client understand security risks and to identify what is needed to improve security,” said Fisher. RSS will soon start presenting a threat analysis and three- to five-year technical roll-out plan at estates using VR and 360-degree cameras. This will show various ways to secure properties, including implementing the latest security camera technology and artificial intelligence. “As far as I can tell, RSS is the first guarding security company in South Africa, and maybe even in the world, to embrace Virtual Reality,” said Fisher. The screenshots below show RSS’s VR tour, which explains how estate security works and how it can be improved. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316237 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-1-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-1-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-1.jpg 950w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316239 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-2-640x400.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-2-640x400.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-2-600x375.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-2-768x480.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS-2.jpg 1049w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316241 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS3-640x400.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS3-640x400.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS3-600x375.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS3-768x480.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS3.jpg 1049w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316243 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS4-640x420.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS4-640x420.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS4-600x394.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS4-768x504.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RSS4.jpg 991w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316245 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Access-Control-640x413.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="413" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Access-Control-640x413.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Access-Control-600x387.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Access-Control-768x496.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Access-Control.jpg 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316247" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fence.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="445" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fence.jpg 1048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fence-576x400.jpg 576w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fence-768x533.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fence-619x430.jpg 619w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
