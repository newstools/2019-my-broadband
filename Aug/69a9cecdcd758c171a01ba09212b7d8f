Nvidia could soon launch a new graphics card based on its Turing TU102 silicon, Tom’s Hardware reports. There are currently four Nvidia GeForce RTX products which use the Turing TU102 chip, but the latest changelog for Nvidia’s AIDA software implies that the company could be developing a fifth GPU based on the same technology. It is expected that the upcoming GPU could feature a performance level between the GeForce RTX 2080 and the RTX Titan Black, as these chips all use the same TU102 silicon. Tom’s Hardware speculated that the upcoming Nvidia RTX GPU could be an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Super, bridging the gap between the RTX 2080 Ti and Titan RTX. Nvidia has not officially announced any upcoming RTX graphics cards, but the company previously confirmed that high-end Navi GPUs are in development.
