Samsung has launched its Galaxy Note 10 smartphone lineup, which comprises the Note 10 and the Note 10+. These premium smartphones are in a similar price range to Apple’s iPhone Xs and Xs Max, and offer powerful features that are positioned to compete with these devices. The Note 10 and Note 10+ offer big improvements over Samsung’s previous-generation Galaxy Note 9 range, including a new cutout camera design, an improved S-Pen, and improved performance thanks to its new 7nm chipset. We have compared the pricing, specifications, and features of the Samsung Note 10 range to Apple’s iPhone Xs and Xs Max below. Samsung’s 256GB version of the Galaxy Note 10 smartphone, which is the only version that will be coming to South Africa, is priced R18,999 – which is substantially cheaper than the 256GB version of the iPhone Xs. The 256GB Galaxy Note 10+, which is positioned as the best smartphone in the Galaxy Note range, is also substantially cheaper than Apple’s iPhone Xs Max smartphone. This is despite the Galaxy Note devices being newer devices and offering improved technology over the Xs and Xs Max. Below is the pricing for Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ smartphones in South Africa: Below is the pricing for the iPhone Xs and Xs Max smartphones: Both of these smartphones use the latest versions of their respective operating systems – iOS 12 and Android 9.0. However, a new version of the iPhone operating system – iOS 13 – is in the works and is expected to be released next month, which means that the Xs and Xs Max’s operating systems will soon be outdated. Despite this, many users prefer the iOS interface and have other Apple devices – which may see these users prefer the iPhone Xs or Xs Max. The Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ both use a 7nm Exynos 9825 octa-core chipset, while the iPhone Xs range uses the A12 Bionic processor. A triple-camera system is used in the Galaxy Note 10 range, with the Note 10+ also offering a fourth DepthVision lens.  In contrast, the iPhone Xs and Xs Max only have a dual-camera system. Both Note 10 smartphones use an in-screen fingerprint sensor, whereas the iPhone Xs and Xs Max do not offer fingerprint sensors – instead relying exclusively on their Face ID functionality for biometric identification. It is worth noting that Apple will be launching its next-generation smartphones later this year, which will offer superior features to the current generation and may compare more favourably with the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+. Below are the specifications and minimum local pricing for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ compared to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315943" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/xs-vs-note-10-1.png" alt="xs vs note 10-1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/xs-vs-note-10-1.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/xs-vs-note-10-1-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/xs-vs-note-10-1-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315941" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/xsmax-vs-note-10.png" alt="xsmax vs note 10+" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/xsmax-vs-note-10.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/xsmax-vs-note-10-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/xsmax-vs-note-10-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
