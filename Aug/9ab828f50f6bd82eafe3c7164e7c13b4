A number of security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Windows 10. The security flaws are similar to those exploited by the self-replicating WannaCry ransomware in 2017.

Microsoft published a blog post detailing the security flaws, which lie within its Remote Desktop Services (RDS) code. Affected operating system versions include: Microsoft has released patches to address the security vulnerabilities and urged users to update their systems as quickly as possible. “It is important that affected systems are patched as quickly as possible because of the elevated risks associated with wormable vulnerabilities like these,” the company said. “Customers who have automatic updates enabled are automatically protected by these fixes.”
