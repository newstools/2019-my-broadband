Google has announced that the upcoming version of its mobile operating system will officially be named Android 10. The company said it has stopped the tradition of naming Android operating systems after desserts in an effort to simplify its branding. “This naming tradition has become a fun part of the release each year externally,” Google said. “But we’ve heard feedback over the years that the names weren’t always understood by everyone in the global community.” “We also know that pies are not a dessert in some places, and that marshmallows, while delicious, are not a popular treat in many parts of the world.” The company also revealed a new logo which it said is more modern and accessible, changing the text from green to black and making the robot image a key component of the brand.
