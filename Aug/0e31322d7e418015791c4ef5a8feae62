The Japanese government is offering up to $1 billion in grants to researchers who plan to develop ambitious technologies such as human augmentation and cyborg tech. According to The Nikkei Asian Review, one of the key goals of such technologies would be the replacement of human bodily functions through technology by 2050. Japan also hopes to develop technology that would allow humans to hibernate – which the country believes would help humans in a variety of ways, such as living longer. These grants are part of a wider call for tech proposals in the country – which also include more realistic goals such as dealing with industrial waste and other environmental issues. Japan is suffering a decline in its workforce, and these research grants will also be utilised to address this by finding ways to automate certain types of work, reducing the need for employees in industries such as agriculture and construction. The successful projects will each be given their own deadlines, which will span from 2035 to 2060.
