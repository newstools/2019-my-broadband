Instagram has rolled out a new feature which will allow users in the United States to report false information on the platform, Engadget reports. The social media platform will use this information to determine whether posts must be reviewed by third-party fact-checkers. Users can flag false content on Instagram by reporting the post as “inappropriate” and selecting “false information” as an option. Posts which are found to spread fake news will be de-ranked in the Explore tab and hashtag pages, making them more difficult to find, and the creator will not be notified of this change. Instagram posts which are placed under review will be inspected by the same third-party fact-checking team which examines reported posts on Facebook.
