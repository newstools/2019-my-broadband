Google has announced that it will shut down its Hire job application tracking system. The company said in a post on its support website that while Hire was successful, Google will focus its efforts on other products in its Cloud portfolio. Users will retain access to Google Hire up until the end of their contract or 1 September 2020, and Google will continue to provide support until the end of the product’s lifespan. “After your next bill, there will be no additional charges for your standard usage of Hire up until the end of your contract term or September 1, 2020, whichever comes first,” Google said. Google said the termination of the Hire service would not impact customers’ G Suite agreements or charges.
