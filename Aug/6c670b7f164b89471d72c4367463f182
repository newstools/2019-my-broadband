DStv is losing Premium subscribers in South Africa as locals cut costs in an effort to weather tough economic conditions. Many South Africans are turning to online streaming services for their entertainment instead, as these offer both cheaper monthly subscriptions as well as on-demand viewing and exclusive content. Others are simply cancelling their DStv subscriptions due to the significant cost savings – DStv Premium is priced at R809 per month, with consumers also being charged an extra R95 per month to use PVR functionality. Many South Africans who have DStv subscriptions already have fixed broadband connections, and this makes Netflix and other OTT services a cheaper and more attractive option. If you can manage without DStv entirely, there are various other things you could be spending your money on – especially if you account for the price of DStv Premium package over a period of time. We have listed some of the great products you can buy for the price of DStv Premium, including once-off and monthly products. For around a third of the price of DStv Premium, you can pay a monthly subscription for Netflix, Showmax, and Amazon Prime Video. The total cost of these three streaming services leaves you with over R600 each month to save, which you could also spend on an Android TV box to access your new streaming platforms. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-232843" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Netflix.jpg" alt="Netflix" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Netflix.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Netflix-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Netflix-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> For the price of a DStv subscription, you could take advantage of Afrihost’s Pure Fibre offerings and get a 20Mbps/10Mbps uncapped, unshaped fibre package on Openserve.
