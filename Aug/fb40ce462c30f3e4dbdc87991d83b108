Hidden code found in watchOS 6 by iHelp BR hints towards ceramic and titanium casings for the upcoming Apple Watch 5. While this could be in reference to new versions of the Apple Watch 4, it is more likely that Apple will introduce these body types with its upcoming smartwatch. The Apple Watch 4 currently only ships with a stainless steel body, but previous Apple Watch devices have sported ceramic bodies, too. Titanium, however, would be a new introduction to Apple’s popular smartwatch range. On Saturday, TechRadar reported that analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted a September 2019 launch date for the Apple Watch 5 – further hinting towards the ceramic and titanium bodies being introduced with this new smartwatch. The Apple Watch 5 will sport numerous new features thanks to the new watchOS 6 operating system, including a separate app store designed specifically for the smartwatch interface.
