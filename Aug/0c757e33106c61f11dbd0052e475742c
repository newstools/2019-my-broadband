Google has published research highlighting that 1.5% of Chrome users are accessing websites with unsafe passwords. The company has come to this conclusion after inspecting data from over 650,000 people who have used its Password Checkup extension. “In the first month alone, we scanned 21 million usernames and passwords and flagged over 316,000 as unsafe – 1.5% of sign-ins scanned by the extension,” said Google. Google added that hijackers regularly use exposed credentials to attempt to sign in to websites across the web. “If you use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, this risk disappears,” said Google. However, Google has found that users are reusing unsafe login details for important websites such as financial, government, shopping, and email accounts. Google also announced that it will be launching two new features to its Password Checkup extension – a “direct feedback” mechanism and the ability to opt-out of the anonymous telemetry that the extension reports.
