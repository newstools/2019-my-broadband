By Emile Biagio, CTO, Sintrex If I had one buck for every time we get lured into a “software features” discussion with a potential client, I’d own an overstocked game farm! Or what about the infamous feature shoot out or comparison spread sheet that shows the gaps between products? How many propeller heads have motivated 50% more spend for 20% more features? Hopefully, it was justified. If you have ripped and replaced monitoring software in the past 3 years, or if you’ve invested in yet another tool to fill another gap that you thought was covered in the tools that you already have, then you’re doing something wrong. Read carefully, you’re doing something wrong! Don’t go to market and find other tools… because it might just be the fool behind the tool – and not the tool. Consider a process audit first. Look at what you should be doing, irrespective of the tool’s ability to facilitate the process. If your process audit compliance is low because of a tool, then look for an alternative, but use your requirement framework to find the right fit. If you make up a comparative list, I’d bet that of all the tasks and processes that you should be doing, less than 50% can be blamed on a tool that does not support it. Here are a few considerations if you want to buy a tool – I know it’s probably only a fraction of what’s required, but it’s a good place to start: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317211 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fools-and-their-tools-640x401.png" alt="" width="640" height="401" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fools-and-their-tools-640x401.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fools-and-their-tools-600x376.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fools-and-their-tools-768x481.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fools-and-their-tools.png 915w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> And if you don’t want to buy another tool, consider outsourcing it all and ask questions like these: Make sense? Cause now you’re moving away from looking at the tool. You’re making it someone else’s problem and ensuring that you get the required output to run your business and improve service delivery!
