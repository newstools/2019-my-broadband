Samsung recently launched the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+, which are its newest premium smartphones to enter the market. The Note 10 and Note 10+ both offer substantial improvements when compared to the Note 9 range, including an improved camera design and a new processor. As Samsung is competing primarily with Huawei in the premium Android smartphone market, we opted to compare the latest smartphones from these manufacturers. We have compared the specifications, features, and pricing of Samsung’s new Note 10 smartphones to the Huawei P30 range below. Huawei is known for offering great prices on its smartphones – from entry-level devices all the way through to its premium products. The P30 range is no different, with the P30 and P30 Pro smartphones costing just R13,999 and R16,499 respectively. While Samsung has done a good job of cutting its prices, its smartphones still cost substantially more than their Huawei competitors. In fact, the most expensive P30 smartphone – the P30 Pro – costs less than the most expensive Note 10 – the Note 10+. These savings may encourage some users to choose Huawei devices. However, the Samsung devices are newer and offer some improved features – which may tilt the scale for those who are looking less at the price tag and more at pure functionality. Below is the pricing for the Huawei P30 and P30 Pro smartphones in South Africa. Below is the pricing for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ smartphones: Both the Huawei P30 range and the Galaxy Note 10 range use the Android 9 operating system. This is the latest Android operating system available to smartphone users. While the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ both use a 7nm Exynos 9825 octa-core chipset, the Huawei P30 and P30 Pro both use the HiSilicon Kirin 980. These are both high-end processors that should be more than sufficient for everyday users. The camera systems of these two smartphone ranges also compare similarly. The P30 and Note 10 both offer a triple-camera system, while both the P30 Pro and the Note 10+ offer an additional fourth lens that is used to provide additional depth and focus. Samsung is slightly ahead in the memory department, with the Galaxy Note 10 and 10+ offering 8GB and 12GB of RAM respectively. In contrast, the P30 and P30 Pro only offer 6GB and 8GB of RAM each. While the Note 10 will offer 256GB of storage to South African buyers, the P30 only offers 128GB of storage space. The more powerful P30 Pro offers users up to 512GB storage – eclipsing the Note 10+, which still only offers 256GB. Both the Huawei and Samsung Galaxy smartphones also offer under-screen fingerprint sensors, offering increased security to users. It is worth noting that the Mate 30 Pro is predicted to launch next month, and it could offer improved specifications to those of the P30 and P30 Pro. Below are the specifications and minimum local pricing for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ compared to the Huawei P30 and P30 Pro. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-316299" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/p30-vs-note-10.png" alt="p30 vs note 10" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/p30-vs-note-10.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/p30-vs-note-10-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/p30-vs-note-10-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-316301" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/p30-pro-vs-note-10.png" alt="p30 pro vs note 10+" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/p30-pro-vs-note-10.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/p30-pro-vs-note-10-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/p30-pro-vs-note-10-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
