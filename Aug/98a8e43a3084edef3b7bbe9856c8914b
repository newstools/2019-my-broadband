Kulula charges customers an additional fee for seats which promise extra legroom, but an unpleasant surprise awaits some people who book these seats. Kulula explains on its website: “Whether it’s some extra legroom, or simply a view of the clouds you’re looking for, you can select your favourite spot for a small fee.” On two recent Kulula flights – to George and Durban – MyBroadband journalists booked extra-legroom seats only to find out they did not receive what they paid for. On the George flight, the seats that were sold as “emergency exit row” seats with extra legroom turned out to be normal seats. On the Durban flight, the “Front Exit Row” (row A) seats that promised extra legroom at an additional fee had no extra legroom. In fact, because it was not possible to put your feet underneath the seat in front of you, the experience was worse than sitting in a normal seat. This is a change from previous flights, where both rows A and B offered passengers extra legroom. The image below, which comes from the Kulula website, explains what people are promised. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316787 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Kulula-extra-legroom-640x384.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Kulula-extra-legroom-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Kulula-extra-legroom-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Kulula-extra-legroom.jpg 666w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The photos below show the difference between the usual Front Exit Row seats with extra legroom, and the “new” row with no extra legroom. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316791" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-legroom.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-legroom.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-legroom-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-legroom-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-legroom-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316795" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-Legroom-seat.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-Legroom-seat.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-Legroom-seat-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-Legroom-seat-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Extra-Legroom-seat-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316797" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="458" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A-2.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A-2-558x400.jpg 558w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A-2-768x550.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A-2-600x430.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316799" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Row-A-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Kulula was asked for comment regarding the extra legroom which had seemingly disappeared, but the company did not respond by the time of publication. The company also did not say why some people who booked “emergency exit row” seats received normal seating.
