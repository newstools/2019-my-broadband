WhatsApp has released a new beta update for its Android application, bringing a number of changes to the platform, WABetaInfo reports. According to the report, WhatsApp has begun its rebranding to reflect its Facebook ownership, with the settings menu for the Android app now reflecting its new title: “WhatsApp from Facebook”. WhatsApp has also started to develop a feature that will enforce the minimum age requirement in its Terms of Service (ToS), which states that users in Europe are only allowed to use the app if they are over 16 years old. Users in regions outside of Europe must be at least 13 years old to use WhatsApp. The report said this new feature would aid in banning underage users, although it is unclear how the company will detect who does not meet the age requirement. Users who want to try out the beta version of WhatsApp can download the update by signing up through the Google Play Beta Programme.
