Samsung may relaunch its Galaxy Fold smartphone on 6 September, reports Korean publication yna.co.kr. The date coincides with the opening day of the IFA 2019 conference in Berlin, so Samsung may use this platform to launch the device. Samsung previously said it would re-launch the smartphone sometime in September, but it has not given a precise date for the launch. The device was originally set to launch in April, but a variety of critical design issues meant that Samsung delayed its launch. These included issues with the deviceâ€™s display and its hinge. However, Samsung claims to have fixed these issues, and is in the process of polishing the commercial version.
