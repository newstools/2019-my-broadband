Game developer Rivsoft has launched a web app which allows users to play the original Diablo game from within their Internet browser. Any user can play the demo version of the game for free, although they will be limited to one character class and only a few levels. However, if the player has a copy of the full game installed, they can upload its main data file to the web application and play through the entire game. Rivsoft said the game was built from the original source code, meaning that bugs and other errors may still pop up as they did in the original version of the game. Users who donâ€™t have the original game but would like to play through it in their web browser can purchase the title for $9.99 from GOG.
