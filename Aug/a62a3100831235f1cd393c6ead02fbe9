Facebook is developing a companion messaging app for Instagram, The Verge reports. According to a report, the messaging app will be named Threads and will allow users to send messages and media using Instagram’s editing tools. Threads is reportedly being tested internally at Facebook, and will be aimed at facilitating conversation between users and people on their “close friends” list. The app could be positioned as a competitor to Snapchat, with users automatically sharing real-time information such as location, speed, and battery life. Users will reportedly be able to view Instagram stories from within the Threads app, with the interface bearing many similarities to the direct messages platform within Instagram.
