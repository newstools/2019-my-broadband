SA Post Office CEO Mark Barnes has resigned, citing differences on a forward strategy in relation to the structure of the group, in particular the location of Postbank. “Following discussions on Barnes’ resignation with the Board, the parties are in agreement on an amicable separation,” the Post Office said in a press statement. The board thanked Barnes for his “enormous service to the SA Post Office and the country during his tenure”. “In his time at the SA Post Office, Barnes has led the stabilisation of the organisation as well as pioneered its positioning as a relevant access point of government services for our communities,” it said. The Post Office assured customers and the SA public that the departure of the outgoing CEO will not negatively impact the organisation’s operations. Lindiwe Kwele, the SA Post Office’s current COO, has been appointed as the interim CEO until the recruitment of a new CEO occurs. “To ensure continuity, Barnes will remain within the SA Post Office fold for a period to aid the transition of the interim Group CEO,” the SA Post Office said.
