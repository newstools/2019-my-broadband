YouTube Premium subscribers now have the ability to download videos from the platform in 1080p quality on their smartphones, Android Police reports. The feature was previously only available for up to 720p video downloads, but given the increase of display resolutions in recent years, it was inevitable that YouTube increase maximum download quality for users. The feature was first spotted on Apple devices, but Android Police has confirmed that it is also available to Android users. It was reported back in February that YouTube was considering this move, but the company remained quiet about the feature until quietly launching it this week. It is uncertain whether the feature will roll out to Premium subscribers from all countries, or if it will be limited to certain regions.
