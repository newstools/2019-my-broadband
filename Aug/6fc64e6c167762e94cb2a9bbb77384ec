Lenovo laptops are some of the most trusted tech devices on the market today. This is because they are fantastic all-round machines – offering great performance and an equally impressive build quality. As a leading laptop brand, Lenovo is committed to using only the best components in their product ranges. This is why their recently launched ThinkPad T495 range offers users the best AMD tech available. AMD’s second-generation Ryzen Pro processors, which are used in the ThinkPad T495 range, offer powerful performance thanks to their multi-threading capabilities and impressive clock speeds. Offering 4 CPU cores and 8 threads, the Ryzen 7 range of processors is well-equipped to handle your every computing need – from simply surfing the Internet, to performing advanced image and video editing tasks. This makes the second-generation Ryzen 7 processors great options for business users, who require versatility to deal with their daily tasks. Lenovo’s ThinkPad T495 range consists of two laptops – the T495s, and the T495. Both laptops offer impressive performance for business people and are capable of handling tough tasks with ease thanks to their AMD Ryzen processors. Customers can choose up to a powerful 2nd-generation AMD Ryzen 7 Professional processor, which is a premium business CPU capable of powering almost any task that you could imagine. These processors also offer AMD’s integrated Vega Graphics. The T495s supports up to 16GB RAM and up to a 1TB PCIe SSD – serving all your memory and storage needs with absolute ease. Importantly, the T495s also offers an impressive battery which can last up to 16.4 Hrs thanks to its 57Whr capacity. This battery also has a RapidCharge feature, which lets you charge the laptop up to 80% very quickly through a 65W AC connection. The T495s boasts a 14-inch FHD IPS display which is crisp and clear. It will be easy on your eyes if you’re working for many hours each day, while the 14-inch size means the laptop is still small enough to transport easily. For those seeking an even more impressive laptop, the ThinkPad T495 offers some subtle yet valuable upgrades over the T495s. It can support up to 32GB RAM – double that of the T495s.
