Numerous Telkom Mobile customers raised concerns about not having access to USSD services from Wednesday 28 August. This Telkom Mobile USSD downtime meant users could not buy data or Mo Nice deals, view balances or use recharge vouchers. The Telkom helpdesk told users that they were aware of the problem, but could not provide further details about the downtime. Telkom’s online support channels also told users that both *180# and *123# (Mo`Nice) USSD services are currently under maintenance. “If you wish to buy bundles please use the Telkom App or Internet banking, we apologize for the inconvenience,” Telkom said. The chart from Downdetector, which tracks downtime experienced by companies across the world, clearly shows the problems on Telkom’s network. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-318059" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Telkom-Problems.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="259" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Telkom-Problems.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Telkom-Problems-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Telkom was asked for comment regarding the issue, but the company did not respond by the time of publication.
