Discord is rolling out a new feature which will allow gamers to stream their gameplay live to up to 10 friends, Polygon reports. The feature is called Go Live, and will initially function as an extension of the appâ€™s screen sharing feature, which has previously been limited to private voice calls. Go Live broadcasts only the game window to viewers, however, and will subsequently require game detection to be used. These live streams will be available to users in the same voice channel as the host and will support 10 participants including the streamer. Discord will also integrate this feature with its Nitro offering, allowing Nitro Classic users to view in 1080p and Nitro Standard users to view in 4K. Normal users will only be able to view streams in 720p. The Go Live feature will begin rolling out to Discord users from 15 August 2019.
