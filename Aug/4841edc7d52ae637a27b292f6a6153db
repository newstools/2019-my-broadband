Microsoft launched its Azure Security Lab at the Black Hat 2019 conference, VentureBeat reports. Azure Security Lab is an environment dedicated to allowing security research experts to test the Azure cloud’s security. The platform will require researchers to apply to join the program, and if they are accepted, the researchers will have access to a direct line of communication with Azure’s security team. “We have new scenario-based challenges with additional bounty awards of up to $300,000 in the Azure Security Lab,” said Kymberlee Price, Microsoft’s security community manager. “Throughout the year, more than $2 million of scenario bounty rewards will be offered to Azure Security Lab participants.” Microsoft also disclosed that it has offered up $4.4 million over the past 12 months in bounty payments.
