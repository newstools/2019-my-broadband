Google is working on a security feature which will warn users if their passwords have leaked online, Techdows reports. The company is reportedly integrating its Password Checkup extension into the Chrome browser to assist users in identifying which of their accounts have been compromised in online data breaches. According to the report, this feature is already in the latest Chrome Canary build, and can be enabled via the “chrome://flags” customisation. Once enabled, users will be warned when they try to enter a compromised password into a password field. The browser will also offer a stronger, randomly-generated password as an alternative. The report stated that the feature will be compatible with Windows and Android versions of the Chrome browser, although it could take a few months for it to roll out to the stable version of Chrome.
