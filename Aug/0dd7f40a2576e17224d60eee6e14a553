MyBroadband conducted the biggest ever mobile network testing project in South Africa earlier this year, measuring data speeds in all of South Africa’s major cities, several secondary cities, and a few small towns along the way. The project kicked off in Gauteng in mid-May, and was made possible thanks to partnerships with Afristay, which covered the costs of accommodation around South Africa, and Huawei Mobile Devices, which provided devices with which to conduct tests. Coverage and data throughput tests were conducted using the MyBroadband Speed Test App, running on Huawei Mate 20 Pro smartphones — the world’s first phone to support Cat. 21 LTE connections. SIMs from Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom, and Rain were installed in our test devices, and performance tests were conducted at regular intervals while driving. In addition to the controlled drive tests, MyBroadband also collected results from MyBroadband Speed Test App users across the country. MyBroadband also partnered with antenna and wireless communications specialist Poynting to improve the test bench and test vehicle design, ensuring accurate network testing results. Poynting is a global leader in the design and manufacturing of cellular antennas, which made it a perfect partner for this project. With the help of Professor Andre Fourie and Dr. Derek Nitch, our test benches were designed to deliver accurate results. MyBroadband also followed the guidance of Fourie and Nitch in the selection and design of its dedicated testing vehicle. The testing vehicle—a bakkie with a fibreglass canopy—minimises the problems associated with using a passenger car, such as signal penetration issues due to the vehicle’s metal body. Averages are calculated for the download speed, upload speed, and latency measured in each area. These key network performance indicators are then combined into a Network Quality Score out of 10. Each of the three averages is normalised and weighted according to importance. The weight for each performance indicator was derived from the results of a MyBroadband survey. The survey asked IT professionals how they rate the importance of download speed, upload speed, and latency when choosing a mobile data connection. Understanding the maps below: Each of the red dots indicate a test in that area. Larger red dots indicate multiple tests. Vodacom and MTN finished in a dead heat in Johannesburg, though the two networks performed quite differently across the three metrics we measured. MTN had the lower download speed (38.5Mbps vs. 42.3Mbps), but posted higher upload speeds (18.3Mbps vs. 13.4Mbps) and had slightly better average latency. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317649" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Johannesburg.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="778" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Johannesburg.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Johannesburg-329x400.jpg 329w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Johannesburg-768x934.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Johannesburg-354x430.jpg 354w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In Pretoria, MTN achieved the best results overall and had a much higher average download speed of 52.1Mbps compared to Vodacom’s 41.6Mbps. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317651" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pretoria.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="909" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pretoria.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pretoria-282x400.jpg 282w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pretoria-768x1091.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pretoria-303x430.jpg 303w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Based on our drive tests in the second quarter, MTN had the best mobile data network in Gauteng thanks to its better average latency and upload speed. Fractions separated MTN from Vodacom when it came to average download speeds in the province, with MTN achieving downloads of 40.1Mbps and Vodacom getting 40.2Mbps. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317803" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gauteng.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="1062" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gauteng.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gauteng-241x400.jpg 241w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gauteng-768x1274.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gauteng-259x430.jpg 259w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Unlike Gauteng, there was no contest in the Western Cape. MTN achieved a convincing victory over the other five mobile data networks in South Africa. Vodacom came last in Cape Town and the Western Cape, while Telkom and Rain came second and third, respectively. It should be noted that even though Vodacom’s overall network quality in the Western Cape is not great, it does offer wider coverage than Telkom and Rain. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317805" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Western-Cape.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="696" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Western-Cape.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Western-Cape-368x400.jpg 368w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Western-Cape-768x835.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Western-Cape-395x430.jpg 395w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The only reason MTN didn’t score a perfect 10 in Cape Town or the Western Cape overall was that Rain beat it in average latency. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317653" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cape-Town.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="857" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cape-Town.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cape-Town-299x400.jpg 299w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cape-Town-768x1028.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cape-Town-321x430.jpg 321w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Of all the places we tested in KwaZulu-Natal, Vodacom came closest to MTN in Durban. MTN had an average download speed of 70Mbps, while Vodacom had 63.8Mbps. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-311013" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Durban.jpg" alt="Durban mobile network quality test map and scores summary, 2019 Q2" width="640" height="800" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Durban.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Durban-320x400.jpg 320w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Durban-768x960.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Durban-344x430.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Pietermaritzburg saw much lower average download speeds than Durban.

Telkom had higher average download speeds than Rain (25.8Mbps vs. 22.3Mbps), but Rain had higher upload speeds and better latency. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317667" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Richards-Bay.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="802" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Richards-Bay.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Richards-Bay-319x400.jpg 319w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Richards-Bay-768x962.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Richards-Bay-343x430.jpg 343w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While MTN’s victory in KwaZulu-Natal wasn’t by the same margin as in the Western Cape, it still scored significantly better than Vodacom. The margins were evident in the download speeds, where MTN had an overall average of 40Mbps, while Vodacom’s was 27.9Mbps. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317807" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/KwaZulu-Natal.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="918" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/KwaZulu-Natal.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/KwaZulu-Natal-279x400.jpg 279w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/KwaZulu-Natal-768x1102.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/KwaZulu-Natal-300x430.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cell C narrowly beat Vodacom for overall best mobile data network performance in the Free State. This was thanks to its slightly better average latency and higher upload speeds. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317809" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Free-State.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="803" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Free-State.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Free-State-319x400.jpg 319w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Free-State-768x964.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Free-State-343x430.jpg 343w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While Cell C may have achieved good average performance across the whole of the Free State, its showing in Bloemfontein was poor. MTN’s average download speed was 72.7Mbps, and Vodacom’s 63.3Mbps. Cell C only managed an average download speed of 13.9Mbps in Bloemfontein. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-310783" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bloemfontein-scores.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="927" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bloemfontein-scores.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bloemfontein-scores-276x400.jpg 276w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bloemfontein-scores-768x1113.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bloemfontein-scores-297x430.jpg 297w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Telkom and Vodacom were neck-and-neck in East London, posting similar average download speeds and achieving the same network quality score. Telkom was fractionally faster, with a download speed of 20.4Mbps compared to Vodacom’s 20.3Mbps. Cell C came close by virtue of its faster upload speed (10.9Mbps) and latency, but had slower average download speeds (16.6Mbps). MTN had an average download speed of 22.6Mbps. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-311507" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/East-London-scores.jpg" alt="Mobile network quality tests 2019 Q2 East London scores" width="640" height="782" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/East-London-scores.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/East-London-scores-328x400.jpg 328w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/East-London-scores-768x938.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/East-London-scores-352x430.jpg 352w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The results weren’t as close in Port Elizabeth, with clear margins between the average download speeds: MTN was 25.3Mbps, Vodacom was 22.3Mbps, and Telkom was 20.5Mbps. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317663" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Port-Elizabeth.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="966" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Port-Elizabeth.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Port-Elizabeth-265x400.jpg 265w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Port-Elizabeth-768x1159.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Port-Elizabeth-285x430.jpg 285w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MTN saw average download speeds of 29.1Mbps in Uitenhage.
