Honor, the smartphone company owned by Huawei, plans to take on South Africa with attractively-priced smartphones aimed at the youth market. The company has seen 160% growth over the last year in overseas markets and hopes to mirror this performance in South Africa. Earlier this year, Honor launched its Honor 10 Lite smartphone in South Africa, offering a flagship-style device at a price which the company said is around half of competing smartphones which have similar features. “As Honor forms part of Huawei, this benefits the company as both brands share Research & Development resources, however, Honor has its own product development team,” the company said. “We as the Honor brand regard the South African market as a key pillar to building on our global success, and we envisage that once South African consumers see what Honor devices can do to enhance for their lives, we will most definitely be a force to be reckoned with in this competitive market,” said Honor South Africa CEO Raymond Liu. Honor devices are available at mobile operators and retailers across the country, with contract packages starting from R169 per month and cash prices starting from R1,999 once-off.
