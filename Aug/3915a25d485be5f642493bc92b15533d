In addition, the new active capacitive pen mimics a real writing experience, facilitating participants to focus on the topics of discussions instead of the technology. CTP20 supports PoE where one cable carries both data and power for the device. Data transmission between CTP20 and the terminal is realized either by cable or Wi-Fi, which eliminates the tricky wiring connections between the screen area and the conference table, making clean and well-organized meeting spaces a reality.
