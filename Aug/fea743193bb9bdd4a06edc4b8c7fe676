Microsoftâ€™s Xbox Live online gaming service is back online following a serious outage which affected multiple services. Xbox users reported that they were unable to sign in on their Xbox One consoles and subsequently could not access certain apps and games. Streaming applications including Spotify and Amazon Video were also unavailable, as these required users to be signed into their Xbox Live account. The outage lasted for a few hours, but it took some time for the full suite of Xbox Live features to come back online. While the ability to sign in to Xbox Live was restored a few hours after the outage, issues with party voice chat persisted for another two hours afterwards. Xbox Support stated that all issues are now resolved and the Xbox Live service should be accessible to all users again.
