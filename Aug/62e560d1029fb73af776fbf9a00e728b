By Cheryl Otstott Sometimes you just need to interrupt. Your printer probably has a button for that, but let us take a look at how to enable and use the interrupt feature. The interrupt feature is available on most of the production, wide format, office printers and multi-function printers, but it works differently on different printers. On some printers you can interrupt the copy jobs and on others you can only interrupt a copy job if it is a multiple sets job. Let’s look at the interrupt feature on the ConnectKey and AltaLink families. The interrupt feature will allow you to pause a print job, complete a copy or scan job then resume the print job. This feature cannot be used to promote another print job ahead of a paused job. The interrupt job button must be enabled for the feature to work. <img class="size-full wp-image-317637 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Altron-interrupted-print-jobs-2.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="298" /> Here is a look at the instructions for enabling the feature on the AltaLink, other printers will have similar steps. Once the feature is enabled then it can be used to interrupt a print job if you need to copy or scan something right away.  Let’s look at the steps for using the interrupt feature.  These steps are directly from the online support for the AltaLink printers.  The feature will work the same way on other printers. The Interrupt button pauses the current job to run a more urgent copy or scan job. Note: The Interrupt button must be enabled before it is visible and usable on the User Interface. The Interrupt button is disabled by default. To find how to enable and / or use the feature on your printer please navigate to the support page and enter in your machine model and search on interrupt or pause to find the instructions for your printer. The interrupt feature can come in handy if you need that quick copy for the staff meeting and someone is printing a big print job, for instance 20 manuals that are 50 pages each.  Interrupt that job make your copies and then finish the print job all with the interrupt button.  Time saving and easy to use.
