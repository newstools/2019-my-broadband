Google announced that it has shut down its Trips app, with users no longer able to access the application’s features as of 5 August 2019. The company said it would migrate features previously found in Trips to its Search and Maps applications following the discontinuation of the travel app. Users can find personal Trips information such as notes and saved places in Search, and some of this data will also be available within Google Maps. Within Google Maps, users can find things to do in a destination – such as iconic places, city guide lists, events, or restaurants – by swiping up on the “Explore” tab or searching for a destination. Google added that trip reservations would soon be added to the Maps app, allowing users to organise their bookings from within the application.
