2019 has seen a variety of innovative new tech products released to consumers across the world. Smartphones such as the Huawei P30 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 10 have delivered cutting-edge features to users, including improved cameras and better performance. Gamers have also received exciting new hardware, including AMD’s new third-generation processors and Radeon RX 5700 graphics cards, as well as Nvidia’s RTX GPU lineup. However, there are still many more gadgets that are set to release in the final few months of the year that will excite tech enthusiasts. Below are some of the best devices set to launch this year. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-282597" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Apple-iPad-Pro-2.jpg" alt="Apple iPad Pro 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Apple-iPad-Pro-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Apple-iPad-Pro-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Apple-iPad-Pro-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Apple is expected to launch a new iPad Pro tablet in October 2019. This tablet is expected to use the company’s recently-launched iPadOS 13. This operating system offers a redesigned user interface and allows users to pin widgets directly to their home screen. It will also let users connect an external USB drive to access files through iPadOS, and will offer an improved Safari browser experience. The upcoming iPad Pro is also expected to get a triple-lens camera for superior photography compared to previous iPad models. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-275251" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Apple-Watch-4.jpg" alt="Apple Watch 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Apple-Watch-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Apple-Watch-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Apple-Watch-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Apple is expected to launch its Apple Watch 5 in September 2019, which will use the updated watchOS 6 operating system. The Apple Watch 5 will use the improvements in watchOS 6 to offer customers improved features, such as a separate app store designed specifically for the smartwatch. Further rumours have suggested that the Apple Watch 5 will be offered with ceramic or titanium casing options. While ceramic bodies were present in earlier watches, titanium casing would be a new development from Apple. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297238" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-1-2.jpg" alt="Mate X" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-1-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-1-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-1-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Huawei’s foldable smartphone has been in the works for a long time, having been announced in February at the Mobile World Congress (MWC). It will sport three displays: The Mate X will also have 8GB RAM and 512GB of internal storage. Huawei’s device appears to be one of the best designs for a foldable smartphone, as there is less potential for a creased unfolded display when compared to its competitors. It is expected to launch no later than September. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303250" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold3-573x430.jpg" alt="Samsung-Galaxy-Fold3" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold3-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold3-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold3.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> One of the most well-known competitors to Huawei’s Mate X is the Galaxy Fold. The launch of the Galaxy Fold was heavily delayed after journalists who were provided with test products found a plethora of issues with the device. These were primarily centred around the display of this smartphone, which was prone to numerous issues, including problems with its hinge and a confusing plastic screen cover that could not be removed. The Samsung Galaxy Fold is expected to launch in September. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-284002" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/huawei-mate20-pro-header.jpg" alt="huawei mate20 pro" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/huawei-mate20-pro-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/huawei-mate20-pro-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/huawei-mate20-pro-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Mate 30 Pro is Huawei’s next high-end smartphone range to launch and, based on various leaks, it is expected to boast a quad-camera system which uses Leica lenses and includes a Time of Flight lens. The same leaks suggest that the smartphone will have five-times optical zoom. Further rumours suggest that the device could sport a 6.7-inch QHD+ 90Hz display, a 4,200mAh battery, and a Kirin 985 processor. The Huawei Mate 30 Pro is expected to launch in October.
