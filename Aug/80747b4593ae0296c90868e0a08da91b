French inventor Franky Zapata has crossed the English Channel on a jet-powered hoverboard which he has named the Flyboard Air. The Flyboard Air is powered by a kerosene-filled backpack, allowing it to complete the 35-kilometre channel crossing in 22 minutes with a single stop to refuel halfway. Zapata previously attempted to cross the channel in the same manner last month, but failed due to refuelling problems. “We made a machine three years ago… and now we’ve crossed the Channel, it’s crazy,” Zapata told BBC News. “Whether this is a historic event or not, I’m not the one to decide that, time will tell.”
