MyBroadband has released its July 2019 ISP satisfaction ratings, which show that Supersonic and Cybersmart are the top-rated Internet service providers (ISPs) in South Africa. MyBroadband’s ISP satisfaction ratings are based on feedback from over 10,000 South African broadband users between 1 July 2019 and 31 July 2019. This feedback is gathered via MyBroadband’s Android and iOS speed test apps and its web-based speed test platform. Through these platforms, users are given the opportunity to rate their ISP after they conduct a speed test. These ratings are then aggregated to calculate the average score per ISP and rank service providers from best to worst. The table below provides an overview of the ratings of prominent fibre, ADSL, and fixed-LTE service providers in South Africa.
