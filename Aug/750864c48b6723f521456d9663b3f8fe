For the first time in years, hackers have released a public jailbreak for modern, up-to-date iPhones that poses a big security risk, Motherboard reports. iOS 12.4 inadvertently reintroduced a bug that was previously fixed in iOS 12.3 – making it fairly easy to jailbreak modern iPhones. However, according to Pwn20wnd, who developed the jailbreak, the flaw could also be used to “make a perfect spyware”. “It is very likely that someone is already exploiting this bug for bad purposes,” said Pwn20wnd. “Due to 12.4 being the latest version of iOS currently available and the only one which Apple allows upgrading to, for the next couple of days (till 12.4.1 comes out), all devices of this version (or any 11.x and 12.x below 12.3) are jail breakable—which means they are also vulnerable to what is effectively a 100+ day exploit,” added security researcher Jonathan Levin. This exploit means iPhone users should be cautious when they are downloading new apps, as some of these could have a copy of the jailbreak contained within it.
