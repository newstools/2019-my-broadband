The SABC has announced that its acting chief operations officer (COO) and technology group executive, Dr Craig van Rooyen, has resigned. Van Rooyen reportedly resigned from his position due to personal reasons, and he is set to leave the public broadcaster on 9 September 2019. “My decision to leave the SABC is one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make, due to my good working relationships at the Corporation,” van Rooyen said. “The Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr Madoda Mxakwe, and the Chief Financial Officer, Ms Yolande van Biljon, have made my decision to leave a particularly hard one.” “As Executive Directors, they have demonstrated a serious commitment to people, improving SABC processes, driving customer relations and making the SABC financially sustainable,” he said. SABC board chairman Bongumusa Makhathini said that van Rooyen played a meaningful role in developing the digital strategy of the SABC and preparing the broadcaster for digital migration. The SABC board will begin interviewing potential candidates for the COO role this week and will soon advertise for a new technology group executive.
