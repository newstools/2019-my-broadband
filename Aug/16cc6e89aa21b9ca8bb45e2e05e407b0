Android Q’s sixth and final beta is rolling out to Pixel phones, as well as other participating devices such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the Nokia 8.1, in the coming weeks. “Beta 6 includes all of the features, system behaviours, and developer APIs that you’ll find in the final platform, so it gives you everything you need to get your apps ready,” Google said. Users will also get access to a variety of new fixes and optimisations ahead of the mobile operating system’s official launch. These include refinements to Gesture Navigation, such as a sensitivity preference setting for the back gesture. The official Google schedule for Android Q’s release claims that the operating system will be launched in Q3 2019, and Google said that more information about the release will be coming soon. Despite its recent issues with the US and uncertainty regarding its future use of Android, Huawei has said it is confident that its P30 and P30 Pro will get Android Q.
