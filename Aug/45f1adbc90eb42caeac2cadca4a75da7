Fitbit’s upcoming smartwatch will include support for Amazon Alexa, according to leaked information published by Evan Blass. Blass also leaked images of the new “Versa-class” smartwatch, adding that the device will feature an OLED panel instead of the cheaper LCD technology used in Fitbit’s previous products. The new device will reportedly not be a budget smartwatch, and instead aims to compete directly with flagship smartwatches from competitors like Apple and Samsung. Fitbit has not yet announced when its upcoming flagship smartwatch will be launched. However, the company has stated that it expects increased revenue in the third quarter of 2019, leading many to believe that it will launch the new wearable later this year.
