Openview has expanded its content offering to include sports with the introduction of live English Premier League matches. The free satellite service provider will broadcast the Premier League on its newly established News & Sports channel. The first live match will be broadcast on Saturday 10 August and coverage will run until the end of the football season. Openview will broadcast one live match every week, which will include one of the top six Premier League clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, or Tottenham Hotspur. Together with the live matches, eMedia Investments – the owner of e.tv, eNCA and Openview – has acquired the rights to schedule other football-related magazine programmes that are produced by the Premier League. “This is a momentous addition for us, and for the free-to-air television-watching public,” said COO of eMedia Investments, Antonio Lee. “A leading brand of sport continues in the free-to-air domain and we, at OpenView, are excited to host it.” Lee added that “eMedia will add its very own touch to this broadcast, and hopefully in time, will be able to add more sports offerings on to our bouquet.”
