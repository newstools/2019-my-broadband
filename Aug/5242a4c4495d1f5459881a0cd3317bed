Huawei South Africa has partnered with the Department of Communications to launch free online and on-site training in 5G technology. The company said the training is targeted at 6,000 postgraduate ICT students and practitioners, and Huawei added that it would also send ten university students on a study trip to China as part of its annual “Seeds for the Future” programme. “We recently launched a free 5G training course at the University of Pretoria, WITS, and UJ and plan to take that to more institutions,” said Huawei SA CEO Spawn Fan. “We are now partnering with the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies to deliver a 5G and 4IR online training platform with an accredited certification for 5,000 ICT students and professionals in South Africa.” “We aim to train a further 1,000 students in our on-site programme,” Fan said. Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams also spoke at the event, stating that educating South African youth about 5G technology was important for “building a capable 4IR army”.
