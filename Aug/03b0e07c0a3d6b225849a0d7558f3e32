Reunert executive director and Nashua CEO Mark Taylor has resigned in preparation of leaving the country. Reunert said in a statement that Taylor has tendered his resignation from the Reunert board of directors with effect from 1 October 2019. Taylor currently has executive responsibility for the information communication technologies (ICT) segment at Reunert. “Mark’s resignation is due to his decision to emigrate during the latter part of the 2020 calendar year,” Reunert said. Taylor will step down from the Reunert board at the beginning of the 2020 financial year, on 1 October 2019. To ensure continuity and a structured handover, Taylor will be serving an extended notice period and his employment relationship with Reunert will continue into 2020. Taylor started his career 37 years ago at Nedbank, where he became a computer operator and later a programmer. One of his big breaks came when he was given a large project to manage, which allowed him to quickly increase his skill set. After a number of mergers in the industry, he was appointed operations and IT director of Nashua Mobile in 1999. He continued to rise in the company and, after serving in the dual role of CIO and COO, he was ultimately promoted to CEO of Nashua Mobile in 2003. He left Nashua Mobile for a top position at Vodacom, but returned four years later as executive director at Reunert and CEO of Nashua.
