Microsoft has updated how the Windows 10 user interface is displayed on 2-in-1 tablets in its latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build. “This new experience allows users entering tablet posture to stay in the familiar desktop experience without interruption,” said Microsoft. Other changes have been made to improve the experience of the interface on a touch screen: Microsoft said that the new version is available to a limited number of Insiders while it evaluates the quality of the new interface. It added that when using the laptop functionality of their 2-in-1 tablet, Windows will continue to function as before, and when the keyboard is folded back or removed, the new mode should automatically trigger.
