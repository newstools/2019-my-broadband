Huawei’s upcoming Mate X foldable smartphone will use the company’s latest Kirin 990 chipset, TechRadar reports. Yanmin Wang, Huawei Consumer president of CEE, Nordic, and Canada, confirmed this to TechRadar at a briefing in New York. The Kirin 990 is set to be launched in two versions at IFA 2019 next month – a standard version and a 5G-compatible version. Huawei’s Mate X was originally slated to ship with the Kirin 980 chipset, but given the delays to the device’s original launch schedule, Huawei has decided to include its newest processor instead. The Mate X, which was unveiled in February, was expected to launch in June or July, but Huawei decided to delay the release to ensure the smartphone didn’t suffer the same issues as Samsung’s Galaxy Fold.
