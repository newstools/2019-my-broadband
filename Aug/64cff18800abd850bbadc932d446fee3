Apple has launched its Apple Card, a digital credit card that can be used in place of a physical card, in the United States. The card, which has been developed in partnership with Goldman Sachs and MasterCard, offers users a variety of features, including no banking fees and a simple user interface. “We’re thrilled with the overwhelming interest in Apple Card and its positive reception,” said Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey. “Customers have told us they love Apple Card’s simplicity and how it gives them a better view of their spending.” The card offers additional benefits such as a cash rewards programme – which gives back a percentage of every purchase to the user – and improved security features such as payment authorisation via Face ID or Touch ID, and a one-time dynamic security code.
