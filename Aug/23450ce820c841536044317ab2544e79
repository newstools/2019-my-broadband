FNB has announced that users will no longer be able to save their online banking passwords to their browsers. Now, every time users want to log into their account, they will have to enter their password manually. The bank claimed that the decision was made to ensure that users’ passwords remained secure. “All stored passwords on your device can be viewed during a malware attack. Passwords can be easily accessed on your unattended/unlocked/stolen device,” said FNB. FNB also gave users additional tips to keep their passwords safe: This change could prevent your password from being compromised by malware present on your device, but it could also interfere with various third-party password lockers such as LastPass. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316191" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FNB-password-552x430.jpg" alt="FNB password" width="640" height="499" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FNB-password-552x430.jpg 552w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FNB-password-513x400.jpg 513w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FNB-password-768x599.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FNB-password-1200x935.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
