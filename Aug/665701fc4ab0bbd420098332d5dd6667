When looking to build a strong financial portfolio for your and your family’s future, it is worth considering the stock market as a means of diversifying your investments. Online trading is one of the most effective ways of making money, and many people make a lucrative living purely off investing in shares. One of the largest barriers of entry into the stock market is the need to manage your entire portfolio and make all trades through brokers – which can be inconvenient, and often costs a sizeable percentage of your earnings. Mexem is an online trading platform that gives you an easy way to trade your stocks quickly and simply without needing to use a broker. It functions as an introductory broker of sorts for the largest trading platform in the US – Interactive Brokers – meaning that you can rest assured that it is the right platform to do all your trading.
