Huawei has issued a legal letter to The Wall Street Journal, following a report which alleged that the Chinese company aided cybersecurity forces in Uganda and Zambia. Huawei said the report’s allegations were “neither a fair nor a responsible representation of Huawei’s legitimate business activities in these countries”. The company said it provided information to The Wall Street Journal which proved that the allegations were false, and accused the publication of publishing false statements. “Huawei is especially disappointed in the Article and video and radio podcast in light of the information Huawei provided to you during your research for this article, including its email communications from June 19,” the company told The Wall Street Journal in its letter. “Based on Huawei’s June 19 email and other information it provided to you, it is reasonable to conclude that you knew that these sources were not reliable. As a result, and at a minimum, the Journal published these false statements in reckless disregard of their veracity,” the letter stated. Huawei said these false statements have damaged its reputation and added that it would be happy to discuss the issue with the publication going forward.
