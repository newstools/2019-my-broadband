Facebook announced an overhaul to its privacy system which aims to improve clarity when it comes to setting post visibility. The company is rolling out a simplified privacy model which comprises two group types – public and private. Public groups allow anybody to see who is a member of the group along with all the posts shared there, while private groups limit the visibility of members and posts to others in the group. “We also heard that people wanted more control over how their groups can be discovered,” Facebook said. “So now admins will be able to clearly choose whether or not the group can be found in search and other places.” Facebook added that it has been investing heavily in protecting Facebook groups from harm, employing a specialised safety team and AI to proactively detect bad content before it can be viewed by too many users. The company added that it has also been developing new resources for group admins to help them improve privacy and moderate content. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316441" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Facebook-groups-privacy.jpg" alt="Facebook groups privacy" width="640" height="444" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Facebook-groups-privacy.jpg 1920w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Facebook-groups-privacy-577x400.jpg 577w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Facebook-groups-privacy-768x532.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Facebook-groups-privacy-620x430.jpg 620w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Facebook-groups-privacy-1200x832.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
