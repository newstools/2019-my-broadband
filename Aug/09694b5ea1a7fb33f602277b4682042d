The SABC and MultiChoice have reached an agreement regarding the broadcast rights for local Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches. SABC News reported that both parties have reached a compromise after the SABC previously failed to reach the required licence agreement with the PSL and SuperSport. The SABC refused to pay the R280 million required to obtain the broadcast rights for the PSL, as it was only projected to earn R9.8 million per year from airing the content. The SABC has not aired any PSL football matches since the beginning of the season, with the PSL previously labelling this blackout “unacceptable”. Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa and Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams met with PSL, SABC, and MultiChoice to find a solution to the impasse. The parties subsequently issued a joint statement confirming that an agreement had been reached, with more information on the revised deal expected to be released soon.
