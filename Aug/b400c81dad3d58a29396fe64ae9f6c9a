FNB announced that it will roll out its contactless “Tap and PIN” functionality to 600 more ATMs across South Africa over the next year. “Tap and PIN” allows FNB customers with compatible debit and credit cards to perform ATM transactions without inserting their card into the machine. There are currently more than 100 ATMs which have supported the technology since it was first implemented in 2018. “This roll-out is part of our journey to consistently empower customers with tools to perform transactions in a convenient and secure manner,” said FNB Retail CEO Raj Makanjee. “We have been issuing contactless-enabled debit and credit cards to help customers take full advantage of the growing contactless ecosystem.” FNB Points of Presence CEO Lee-Anne van Zyl said that this contactless technology reduces the risk of fraud when interacting with ATMs. “An NFC device has a 15-second average time saving per transaction, a significant reduction from the traditional ATM transaction,” said van Zyl. “We are excited by the positive response from our customers and we believe that expanding ‘Tap & PIN’ to more ATMs will significantly improve customer experience.” The majority of active “Tap and PIN”-enabled ATMs are located in Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal and the Western Cape, but FNB said its current roll-out would ensure most parts of the country are covered.
