Huawei will unveil its upcoming operating system – code-named Hongmeng – at the company’s Developer Conference on 9 August, The Global Times reports. According to sources at Huawei cited by the publication, the first devices that will use the operating system are the company’s Honor smart TV series. These smart TVs are expected to enter the market on 10 August. The operating system is reportedly focused primarily on IoT and industrial use, but could be expanded to support the company’s smartphones if Google is forced to end Android support for Huawei devices. Other sources claimed that Huawei has been testing Hongmeng’s compatibility with Android apps. “The new Huawei phones with the Hongmeng system will debut in the market in the fourth quarter, with up to several million units in stock. It is expected that the smartphone will show up along with the Huawei Mate 30 series,” an anonymous source told the Global Times.
