Midstream Estate has launched a new mobile app which notifies residents of events and service disruptions, and enables users to send emergency requests for paramedics and security. Midstream Estate is one of South Africa’s top estates with a very strong focus on secure living. What makes Midstream Estate unique is that it is a self-contained village in the middle of Gauteng with shopping centres, schools, hospitals, churches, sporting facilities, and restaurants. The app, which was developed by Codehesion, was launched this week and is aimed at providing residents with an easy-to-use platform for all their information and security needs. The Midstream Estate app provides information about services available inside the estate and allows residents to request emergency services. Residents can use the app to send emergency requests for paramedics, security, and snake and bee removal – which will see a response team dispatched to the user’s home or their current location. As emergency responses will only be available within Midstream, the app uses the location feature on smart phones to ensure that the user is within the Midstream precinct. The contact details and addresses of users of the app are also verified in advance to give people access to the emergency call functionality and streamline the process. The app also notifies residents of special events and service disruptions through push notifications, which the user can tailor to suit their needs. The app was downloaded over 1,500 times within the first 2 days which shows the demand for the service. The new Midstream Estate app is available on the Google Play Store for Android users and the Apple App Store for iPhone users.
