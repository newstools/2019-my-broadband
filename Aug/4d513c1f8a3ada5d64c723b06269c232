Cloud backup provider Backblaze has released its hard drive reliability statistics for the second quarter of 2019. The company compared active hard drives used in its operations from Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba, and HGST to compile the report. Reliability was measured as an annualised failure rate, calculated using the number of drive failures relative to the number of active drive days for each disk. Backblaze recorded the number of failures for each hard drive from 1 April to 30 June 2019, extrapolating the annualised failure rate from this data. The cloud provider noted that it has discontinued the last of the Western Digital 6TB hard drives this quarter, meaning that it no longer uses any hard drives from Western Digital. “When Backblaze was first starting out, the first data drives we deployed en masse were Western Digital Green 1 TB drives,” the company said. “So, it is with a bit of sadness to see our Western Digital data drive count go to zero. We hope to see them again in the future.” The company tested a total of 108,461 hard drives this quarter, equating to a total of 9,636,394 days worth of hard drive operation across all products.
