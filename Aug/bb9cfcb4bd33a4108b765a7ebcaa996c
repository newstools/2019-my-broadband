LetsGoDigital has published 3D renders of the PlayStation 5 based on leaked patent papers. If the renders are accurate portrayals of the patented design, the PlayStation 5 will be a massive change from the current-generation PlayStation 4. These renders are speculative, but the documents from which they were created are confirmed to be registered to the World Intellectual Property Office, while a deleted tweet from a Codemasters senior artist confirmed that the documents were of the PlayStation 5 development kit. Sony has already unveiled information about the upcoming PlayStation 5, including the fact that it will be backwards compatible with PlayStation 4 games. It will sport a third-generation AMD Ryzen octa-core processor and a custom AMD Radeon Navi GPU â€“ which will make it capable of supporting 8K graphics. The 3D renders of the PlayStation 5 created by LetsGoDigital are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317673" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v2-640x420.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v2-640x420.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v2-600x394.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v2.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317675" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v4-640x420.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v4-640x420.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v4-600x394.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-v4.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317677 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-1.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-1-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlayStation-5-1-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317679 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlaysStation-5-v3-640x420.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlaysStation-5-v3-640x420.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlaysStation-5-v3-600x394.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PlaysStation-5-v3.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
