Bidorbuy has sold its stake in PayFast to the Kenyan-based DPO Group for an undisclosed price. Bidorbuy was the largest shareholder in PayFast, which is a payment processing service that enables the online transfer of funds between buyers and sellers. “We are proud to have played a role in the growth of this cutting-edge fintech business,” said Bidorbuy.co.za CEO Craig Lubbe in a statement. Lubbe added that the proceeds from the sale of Bidorbuy’s PayFast shares would allow the online retailer to consolidate its position as a popular local online shopping destination. “The strategic decision to divest Bidorbuy of its stake in PayFast will allow us to further intensify our focus on our core business, namely facilitating online trading between independent buyers and sellers.” “Buyers and sellers can look forward to enhanced experiences and functionality as we mark twenty years of bidorbuy.co.za,” Lubbe said.
