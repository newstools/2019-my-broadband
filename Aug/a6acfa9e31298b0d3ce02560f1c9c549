Apple has acknowledged customer concerns over contractors listening to Siri audio recordings, and has announced that it will make changes to ensure its customers’ privacy is protected. “We realize we haven’t been fully living up to our high ideals, and for that we apologize,” said Apple. The company said it will cease to retain audio recordings of interactions users have with Siri, but it will continue to use computer-generated transcripts so that it can improve Siri’s capabilities. Users will also be able to opt in to allowing Siri to learn from audio samples. “We hope that many people will choose to help Siri get better, knowing that Apple respects their data and has strong privacy controls in place,” said Apple. When customers elect to opt in, Apple will ensure that only its own employees will be allowed to listen to these audio samples and it will actively work to delete any recordings which are the result of Siri being triggered by mistake. Many of the world’s largest tech companies have come under fire recently for paying contractors to review voice assistant recordings without making this clear to customers.
