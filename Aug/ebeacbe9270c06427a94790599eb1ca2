MyBroadband’s content marketing services are showing excellent results for our clients, delivering measurable ROI and unmatched brand awareness. A standout content campaign in recent months was that of an ISP client who launched new products into the market. The ISP’s new products offered great value and aggressive pricing, and these attributes were focussed on in a range of articles published on MyBroadband.

Not only was the content technically accurate, but it was also written in a way which our readers enjoyed. This results in our readers enjoying a company’s message about its new product or service, and sees them interacting with the content and relevant call to action. The results of the content campaign were immediate, and the articles on MyBroadband started driving traffic to the ISP’s website after they were published. Looking specifically at the ISP product launch article, over 1,900 unique users were sent to the ISP’s website from the following channels: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-317327 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/All-users-640x294.jpg" alt="All users" width="640" height="294" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/All-users-640x294.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/All-users-600x275.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/All-users-768x352.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/All-users.jpg 1090w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Further enhancing the reach of the article was the fact that it was distributed through MyBroadband’s daily email newsletters, and its Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn pages.
