5G technology, along with the AI and cloud systems it enables, will have a transformative effect on industry across the world. This is according to Mohammed Madkour, Huawei VP of wireless and cloud core marketing and solutions, who was speaking at an event in Johannesburg. Huawei’s core vision for the development of 5G comprises four values: society, industry digitalisation, technology innovation, and the creation of a prosperous economy. Madkour said that the industries of the future will no longer be siloed into separate divisions; instead, they will all be connected by a prolific and interconnected telecommunications platform. “Telecom is now the foundation for all industries,” Madkour said. “5G, AI, and Cloud are the medium for transformation across all industries.” “It is not about those technologies themselves – it is about them supporting the revolution of modern industry.” He added that while there is a lot of confusion about the applications of 5G, the technology will have a simple positive effect on the development of industries as well as the consumer experience. “A lot of people say 5G is about a lot of acronyms,” Madkour said. “5G actually offers a rich experience to people, homes, and industries.” In addition to allowing for the modernised development of industries and the proliferation of cloud-based systems, 5G will also provide consumers and mobile users with the speed to enable new applications – from augmented reality to 8K video streaming.
