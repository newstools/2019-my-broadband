MTN has been announced as the new title sponsor of the annual MyBroadband Conference, which shows its leadership and commitment to the South African broadband and telecoms market. The MyBroadband Conference and Expo, now in its fifteenth year, is the premier ICT event in South Africa and the meeting place for the country’s IT and telecoms community. With 3,000 South African ICT decisions makers and the country’s top telecommunications, broadband, and IT companies in one venue, it is the perfect event to drive the industry forward. Every year, the who’s who of the South African ICT industry share the stage at the conference, and this year will be no different, with executives from the top local companies set to speak. Over the last few years, MTN has invested over R40 billion in its network and is now the leader in mobile network performance. The company is also continuing to invest in its fibre network, and its consumer ISP – Supersonic – now tops the South African ISP rankings. As the leader in the South African mobile broadband market, MTN is a perfect partner for the annual MyBroadband Conference. “It is a privilege to partner with MTN to drive the industry forward and ensure that South Africa is ready for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),” said MyBroadband marketing director Cara Muller.
