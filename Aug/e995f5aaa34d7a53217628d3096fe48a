The South African Airways website, hosted at flysaa.com, experienced downtime on Tuesday afternoon. Many SAA clients took to social media to complain about the downtime, which prevented clients from booking flights or checking in online. “SAA online check-in offline today?” one user asked, while another asked: “I can’t seem to make any progress online. Are you guys down?” Another user said: “What’s wrong with your site? I have been trying to make a booking for the past 2 hours”. The company did not respond to complaints from users and it is currently not clear why the website is down. MyBroadband tried to contact SAA about the downtime, but the company could not immediately be reached as it was experiencing “a high volume of calls”. The screenshot below shows what people trying to access the SAA website was greeted with. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-317873" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FlySAA.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="385" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FlySAA.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FlySAA-600x361.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
