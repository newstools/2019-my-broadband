The latest version of Apple’s iOS 13 beta includes images which point to a potential release date for the iPhone 11, iHelp BR reports. According to the report, the latest beta updates for iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 include assets which suggest that the iPhone 11 will launch at an event on 10 September 2019. The beta updates include images which will help users set up the operating systems following the launch of the new devices. These pictures include notes to “Hold for release” along with the date of 10 September. Similar images were included in beta updates last year with the date 12 September 2018, which is when Apple launched the iPhone Xs. Apple is expected to launch three new iPhone models this year, which will serve as direct upgrades to the iPhone Xs Max, Xs, and Xr. Expected changes include a next-generation processor, improved cameras, and a new Taptic Engine to replace the current 3D touch system on the top two 2019 smartphones.
