Netflix’s Android application is tracking some users’ movements by requesting access to physical activity sensors, TheNextWeb reports. Netflix told TheNextWeb that it was tracking user movements to try and improve video quality when a viewer is moving. “We are continually testing ways to give our members a better experience,” Netflix said. “This was part of a test to see how we can improve video playback quality when a member is on the go.” “Only some accounts are in the test, and we don’t currently have plans to roll it out,” the company added. The streaming platform’s Android application includes various mobile-centric features which aim to improve the streaming experience on smartphones. These include automatic data usage optimisation, which kicks in when the viewer is not connected to Wi-Fi.
