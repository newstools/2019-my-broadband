Samsung has announced its 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX, the first mobile image sensor to go beyond 100 million pixels. The sensor, which was developed in collaboration with Xiaomi, will also be able to record video at resolutions of up to 6K at 30 FPS. According to Samsung, this new sensor “delivers unparalleled colour reproduction and stunning detail” due to its advanced Tetracell and ISOCELL Plus technology. “Samsung is continuously pushing for innovations in pixel and logic technologies to engineer our ISOCELL image sensors to capture the world as close to how our eyes perceive them,” said Yongin Park, executive VP of sensor business at Samsung. Lin Bin, co-founder and president of Xiaomi, said that the company was very happy with the sensor, and anticipates more innovation as it continues its partnership with Samsung. “We are very pleased that picture resolutions previously available only in a few top-tier DSLR cameras can now be designed into smartphones,” said Bin. Mass production of this sensor will begin later this month.
