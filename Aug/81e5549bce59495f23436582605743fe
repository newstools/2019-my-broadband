Vodacom has launched its latest “Red Hot Dealz”, offering big discounts on large SIM-only data bundles on a 24-month contract. Vodacom is offering an 80GB data package, consisting of 50GB anytime data and 30GB Night Owl data, for R299 per month. For those looking for less data, Vodacom has a 40GB data package, consisting of 20GB anytime data and 20GB Night Owl data, for R199 per month. There are two device options which accompany these deals – a Huawei R218h mobile router for an additional R30 per month and a Huawei B315 home router for an extra R50 per month. These deals are available until 8 September 2019 and require customers to sign a 24-month Vodacom contract and pay a once-off SIM and connection fee of R204.
