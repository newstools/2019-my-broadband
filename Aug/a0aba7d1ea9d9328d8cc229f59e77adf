Eight people who allegedly ran two illegal streaming services which claimed to offer “more television programmes and movies than legitimate streaming services such as Netflix” have been indicted by a federal grand jury, reports ArsTechnica. The streaming service, called Jetflix, ran from 2007 to 2017 and sourced its content from various torrent and Usenet websites by using a variety of automated programs. Jetflix made this content available on US and Canadian servers, and charged subscription fees starting at $9.99 per month. The service claimed to have over 183,200 different television episodes, while iStreamItAll – which was created by one of the accused – claimed to offer 115,849 television episodes and 10,511 individual movies – which is significantly more than Netflix’s catalogue of 4,010 movies as of 2018. None of the accused has been taken into custody, claims The Washington Post. However, the two kingpins could face decades in prison, while the other six accused could face up to five years behind bars.
