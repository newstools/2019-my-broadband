According to 22 On Sloane’s Kizito Okechukwu, technology is a necessity in business because it helps to streamline processes and provides the flexibility to push to the next level. Okechukwu was speaking in a panel discussion at the HP Neverstop Small Business Event recently in Johannesburg. The panel discussed how cost-effective technological advancements are enabling small businesses to succeed. “Technology can be applied to anything, but it’s only effective and valuable to a business if they ask themselves what they need in order to succeed,” said Rapelang Rabana from Rekindle Learning. “A good place to start is by looking at the business challenges you are facing and need to address.” According to the panel, this often boils down to productivity, cost-efficiency, and uptime. Since small businesses can’t afford any downtime, sub-par technology solutions can quickly create problems. HP also spoke about its new laser printing products launched earlier this year, which are specifically designed for small businesses applications. The two new models in this category are the HP Neverstop Laser 1000 series (Wireless), and the HP Neverstop Laser MFP 1200 series (Wireless). “The new HP Neverstop Laser Mono printers are ‘cartridge-free’, which means they come with a new mechanism replacing original laser cartridges,” said Jane Geypen, Home and Printing Solutions Category manager for HP. HP has also developed the HP Smart App, which links your phone and your printer so that you can print, scan, and even set up your printer using your smartphone. “HP Neverstop Laser is a game-changer. No-one else in the market has this,” said Geypen. <img class="size-large wp-image-318005 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6893-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="430" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-318015 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6901-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6901-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6901-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6901-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6901-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 85vw, 573px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-318019 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6905-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6905-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6905-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6905-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6905-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 85vw, 573px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-318007 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6894-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6894-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6894-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6894-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6894-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 85vw, 573px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-318013 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6898-573x430.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6898-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6898-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6898-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6898-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 85vw, 573px" />
