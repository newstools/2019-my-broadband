Huawei has launched its new Y9 Prime 2019 smartphone in South Africa, offering a competitor to Samsung’s recently-shipped Galaxy A Series mid-range smartphone lineup. The Y9 Prime 2019 challenges the Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50 directly. It offers impressive specifications at an attractive price and includes a number of features usually only found on flagship smartphones. These include a triple-lens main camera and a bezel-less display without any notch for the front-facing camera. Instead of cutting out a hole in the top of the display, the Y9 Prime 2019 has a pop-up mechanical camera which retracts into the top of the smartphone chassis. Huawei promises that this mechanism can withstand any reasonable stress, and the smartphone even automatically retracts the camera when it senses it has been dropped to avoid damage. We got our hands on the new Y9 Prime 2019, and we put it through its paces. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315529" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-2-640x384.jpg" alt="Y9 Prime 2019 2" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-2-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-2-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-2-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-2-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> It may not have the same solid metal weight and feel as the P30 lineup, but the Y9 Prime 2019 looks the part of a flagship smartphone. A fingerprint sensor is mounted on the rear of the smartphone, and the front of the device is covered entirely by its IPS LCD display. Three camera lenses are placed on the rear of the chassis, and the body’s curved design also mirrors design trends found in high-end flagships. The battery capacity is seriously impressive, and when paired with the improved efficiency of the EMUI 9.0 operating system, it can deliver much better battery life. Other important specifications include 4GB of RAM and a whopping 128GB of internal storage – which is a generous amount of storage space for a mid-range smartphone. The full specifications of the Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 are listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315537" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-GIF.gif" alt="Y9 Prime 2019 GIF" width="600" height="338" /> Just on the merits of its chipset specifications and design, we would have no trouble recommending the Y9 Prime 2019 as a great mid-range smartphone option. The one feature which could make it stand out to local smartphone buyers is that it is the first handset to land in South Africa with a pop-up camera system. We tried out this functionality extensively and found out that it was for more than a simple design quirk. The mechanism is very well designed and can withstand stresses of up to 12kg. It has also been rated for around 100,000 cycles and delivers pictures of exceptional quality thanks to its 16MP lens. If you are fine with the idea of a pop-up camera mechanism on your smartphone, the Y9 Prime 2019 is a great choice for a mid-range smartphone. If you are a fan of selfies but don’t want a big notch to house your powerful front-facing camera, the Y9 Prime 2019 solves this dilemma. Conversely, if you rarely use the front-facing camera, the Y9 Prime 2019 stows it out of the way until you eventually need it, popping up instantly. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315527" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-1-640x384.jpg" alt="Y9 Prime 2019 1" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-1-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-1-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-1-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-1-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315531" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-3-640x384.jpg" alt="Y9 Prime 2019 3" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-3-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-3-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-3-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-3-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315533" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-4-640x384.jpg" alt="Y9 Prime 2019 4" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-4-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-4-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-4-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-4-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-315535" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-5-640x384.jpg" alt="Y9 Prime 2019 5" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-5-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-5-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-5-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-5-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Y9-Prime-2019-5.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
