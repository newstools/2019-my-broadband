Google has begun rolling out a new visual design for the Play Store. The new interface will contain a variety of changes that the company believes will offer a cleaner experience for users. The new Google Play Store interface will also improve app discovery and will offer accessibility features for users who need them. Included in the new design is a navigation bar at the bottom of the store for mobile devices, or on the left for tablets and Chrome OS devices. There will also be two distinct sections for apps and games, as well as cleaner landing pages with larger calls-to-action. Google has also launched new design specifications for app icons, which the company encouraged app designers and owners to begin using. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317085" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-playstore-640x398.png" alt="google playstore" width="640" height="398" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-playstore-640x398.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-playstore-600x373.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-playstore-768x478.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-playstore-1200x746.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-playstore.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
