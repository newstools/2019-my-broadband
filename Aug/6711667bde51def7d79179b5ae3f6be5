RSAWEB has launched its Fibre Fiesta promotion, where clients can save up to R6,300 when switching to RSAWEB fibre. Users who order any 20Mbps or faster uncapped fibre package will also get their first full month free if they order before 30 September 2019. RSAWEB fibre is available on Openserve, Vumatel, Frogfoot, Octotel, SADV, and Century City Connect. RSAWEB’s Fibre Fiesta promotion will see clients receive the following free value: “Fibre will give your home a clear, reliable connection at speeds of up to 200Mbps. You’ll be doing all the things you love online, faster and better than ever before,” said RSAWEB. “Get your game on without any lag, work from home without interruption, download and backup files faster than ever, and stream everything in HD – buffer free.” RSAWEB added that clients will be charged pro rata for their first partial month of fibre, so that they receive a full month free. The special is valid for both “live” and “coming soon” areas. Visit the RSAWEB website to find out more. This article was published in partnership with RSAWEB.
