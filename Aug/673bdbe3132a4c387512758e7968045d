MTN is planning to take on Vodacom by building a better network, ensuring a great customer experience, and offering competitive products. This is the word from MTN Group CEO Rob Shuter, who told Business Day TV that the operator’s vision for its South African operation is to be a strong challenger to Vodacom. Shuter said there are three things which they need to have to move customers from Vodacom to MTN: Shuter is confident that MTN has made good progress on all these fronts, which it said is behind its growth in the post-paid market. He said MTN has the best network in South Africa, which is clearly seen in the awards which they have received from network benchmarking firms over the last 12 to 18 months. Its customer experience has also improved, which is shown in MTN SA’s net promoter score (NPS) improvements. Shuter did, however, admit that there is still a lot of work to be done on the customer experience front. He added that MTN must now make sure that its products, tariffs, and rate plans are competitive to make it the network of choice in South Africa. “Broadly speaking, all three things we need to do are now in place and that is why we are seeing growth in the consumer post-paid business,” Shuter said. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
