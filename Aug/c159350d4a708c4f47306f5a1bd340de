Microsoft has begun rolling out an update which adds a dark mode to a number of its mobile applications. The company said this dark mode feature will be available for Outlook and Office mobile apps on Android and iOS. Applications which will include this option include Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and the company is also planning on bringing a similar overhaul to SharePoint, OneDrive, OneNote, Planner, and To-Do for Android and iOS. “Dark Mode is not only easier on the eyes and may extend battery life, it also enables you to comfortably continue using your device in places where the default bright mode isn’t appropriate, like darkened aeroplanes and movie theatres,” Microsoft said. “Dark Mode is rolling out over the next couple of weeks to Outlook mobile and Office.com.” The initial rollout begins today, although the dark mode for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for iOS will go live with the release of iOS 13.
