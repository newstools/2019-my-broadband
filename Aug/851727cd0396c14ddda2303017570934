Google has begun testing its Play Pass offering, a subscription service which gives users the option to pay a monthly fee for access to a wide variety of paid games and apps. Play Pass, which is positioned to compete with Apple’s Arcade subscription service, was discovered by a reader of Android Police, who sent sign-up pages for the service to the publication. “Explore a curated catalog spanning puzzle games to premium music apps and everything in between. From action hits to puzzles and fitness trackers, with Google Play Pass you unlock access to hundreds of premium apps and games without ads, download fees or in-app purchases,” read one of the screenshots. The screenshots also show that Google Play Pass is priced at $4.99, although this price could change before the service is rolled out to the public. Google confirmed to Android Police that Play Pass is in testing.
