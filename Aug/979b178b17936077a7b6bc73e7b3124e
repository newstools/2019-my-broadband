Uber and Lyft commissioned transportation consultancy Fehr & Peers to study the effects the platforms had on congestion in major cities. The study examined the combined vehicle miles travelled (VMT) for both companies in six cities in September 2018, and compared the results to the total VMT for each city over the same period. The findings showed that both Uber and Lyft have had a significant effect on traffic congestion, although they are still outweighed by personal and commercial vehicles. While the ride-hailing platforms account for only 1-3% of VMT in metropolitan areas, these figures increase up to 13.4% in core centres of each city included in the study. Both companies have previously downplayed their effect on congestion in major cities, but the study’s findings show that their operations have had a notable effect in certain cities. “We are excited to continue working with cities around the world to provide better mobility solutions, and we hope that the results of this study will inform future mobility policies at the local and regional level so we can do just that,” said Uber head of global policy for public transportation Chris Pangilinan in a blog post.
