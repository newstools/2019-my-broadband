Cybersmart has launched a fibre solution for developers, offering them an all-in-one package with 500Mbps fibre access, DStv, an intercom system, CCTV, and access control for their residents. Cybersmart CTO Laurie Fialkov told MyBroadband that the company’s new “fibre package for developers” is aimed at multi-dwelling residential buildings and complexes. With this service, Cybersmart does everything for the developer, including rolling out a fibre network with backhaul connectivity and building all the needed services on top of this network. He explained that this solution means that developers do not have to find separate suppliers for each of the services they want to offer their residents. “At R7,999 per unit, once-off, we offer everything a developer needs on a single platform which makes it easier for everyone,” said Fialkov. He added that this per-unit pricing suits developers, as it works out significantly cheaper than trying to find separate providers for each component. Through Cybersmart, each building receives up to four door stations for the intercom system, CCTV cameras at all entrances, and an access control system. Each unit in the building will receive a full suite of services, including: The fibre connection comes without any installation fee and users can upgrade to an uncapped solution at any time. Residents in these buildings therefore get a fast fibre connection with capped data for free indefinitely. They also benefit from the other bundled services without any additional costs.
