Apple has already begun testing the first big update to its upcoming mobile operating system, iOS 13. The company published an iOS 13.1 developer beta version yesterday – marking the first time an iOS release has been in development beta before the original version has been made publicly available. iOS 13.1 appears to be targeted at adding features that weren’t ready for the initial beta release, including the restoration of Automations within Shortcuts and an option to share your ETA on Maps. Other new features include a volume indicator for AirPods and new HomeKit icons. Apple has not indicated why it released this developer beta so early, but given the plethora of new releases expected from the company over the coming months, it may have wanted to ensure that iOS 13 is in good shape before switching its focus to newer hardware and platforms.
