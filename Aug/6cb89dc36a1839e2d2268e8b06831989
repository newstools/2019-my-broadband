Mobile data prices for high-end bundles in South Africa have plummeted, with Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom offering subscribers affordable big data packages. Vodacom’s latest big data package, for example, offer subscribers 50GB anytime data and 30GB Night Owl data for R299 per month. If one ignores Night Owl data, which is only available between midnight and 05:00, it means that users get mobile data for less than R6 per GB. For those looking for less data, Vodacom and MTN are offering subscribers 10GB anytime data and 10GB after-hours data for R149 per month. These high-end data bundles are exactly what South African consumers have been asking for, but there is a caveat – these products are only available on 24-month contracts. If you want a similar product on prepaid, you can expect to pay multiple times more than contract customers. To appreciate the massive difference between contract and prepaid data prices, it is valuable to look at a side-by-side comparison on data products. The table below provides a comparison of the prepaid and contract data products which consumers can get from Vodacom and MTN. It clearly illustrates why prepaid subscribers feel that they are getting a raw deal when they look at what is available on contract.
