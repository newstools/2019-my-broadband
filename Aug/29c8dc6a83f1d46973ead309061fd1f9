Samsung recently launched updated versions of its mid-range Galaxy A30 and A50 smartphones – the A30s and A50s. The original Galaxy A30 and A50 were both popular in South Africa, as they offered a balance between price and performance. Samsung South Africa told MyBroadband that the A50s would not be coming to South Africa, but added that local users would be able to buy the Galaxy A30s. The Galaxy A30s offers a triple camera system which includes an improved 25MP main camera as well as an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a new 5MP depth camera. The depth camera will allow users to apply professional-level bokeh effects and create more dynamic portraits. The smartphone sports a 6.4-inch HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-V display, which is a reduction in resolution from the 1080p display the A30 offered users. Users will be able to choose between 3GB and 4GB of RAM, as well as up to 128GB of storage space. However, if users require more storage space, the A30s also supports up to 512GB of microSD storage. The Samsung Galaxy A30s will also offer users a 4,000 mAh battery that includes 15W fast charging capabilities. An in-screen fingerprint sensor has also been included to improve the security of the device. Samsung told MyBroadband that the A30s would be available in two colours – Prism Crush Black and Prism Crush Violet. It will also sport an updated look, comprising a geometric design and a “futuristic holographic effect” on the back of the device. The device will retail for R4,499 and will be available from October 2019.
