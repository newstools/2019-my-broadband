Samsung has launched updated versions of its popular Galaxy A30 and A50 mid-range smartphones. These new versions – the Galaxy A30s and A50s – will sport an updated look that sports a geometric design effect as well as improved cameras. The A50s now has a 48MP primary lens and a 32MP front camera, while the A30s sports a new 25MP main sensor and a third, 8MP wide-angle lens. An in-display fingerprint sensor will be available on the A30s, however, it will only have a 720p display – downgraded from the 1080p display on the original A30. The A50s will offer 4GB and 6GB RAM versions, while the A30s will allow users to select between 3GB and 4GB of memory. Both smartphones will offer 64GB and 128GB versions, with the Galaxy A30s also available with 32GB of storage. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317305" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Front-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Front-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Front-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Front-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Front-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317307" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Back-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Back-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Back-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Back-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A30s_Black_Back-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317311" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Front-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Front-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Front-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Front-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Front-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-317309" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Back-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Back-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Back-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Back-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Galaxy-A50s_Black_Back-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
