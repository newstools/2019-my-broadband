Supersonic announced that it has standardised its pricing model across all of South Africa’s fibre network operators (FNOs), effective for new customers from 22 August 2019 [details here]. The ISP now offers standardised asymmetrical and symmetrical packages across all networks, with speeds ranging from 10Mbps to 1Gbps. “Not only does this approach simplify the selection process for our customers, but supercharges the customer application support processes internally too, which means faster, more efficient service and turnaround time – a win/win scenario in an age of instant gratification,” said Supersonic Managing Director Calvin Collett. Supersonic said it was not interested in fighting a “price war” with other operators. “We just don’t believe that dropping our prices will be able to sustain the business nor the industry, so we need to be realistic about our margins that are able to support and grow the network plus consistently improve our service levels,” Collet said. Supersonic’s new standard packages are all uncapped and unshaped, and include the following: Supersonic also offers a telephone line with free number porting and smart mesh Wi-Fi solution as add-on products with its fibre packages.
