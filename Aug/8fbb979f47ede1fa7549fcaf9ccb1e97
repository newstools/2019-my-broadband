The latest Windows 10 preview build includes code that points to a new feature which will allow users to reinstall their operating system from the cloud, Softpedia News reports. “Insiders may notice some references to ‘Cloud download’ relating to PC reset or refresh. This feature isn’t available and working quite yet. We’ll let you know once it is, so you can try it out!” said Windows Insider programme head Dona Sarkar. This cloud download option will be especially useful for users who encounter OS-level problems that make it impossible for them to boot into the Windows environment. Once this feature is implemented, they will be able to access the recovery screen and download a Windows 10 system image stored in the cloud – removing the need for users to manually create a recovery drive. Microsoft said this feature will first arrive for Windows Core OS, but Softpedia reported that it is likely to launch for Windows 10 as well.
