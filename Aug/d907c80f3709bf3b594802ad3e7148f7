Apple’s upcoming iPad Pro could use a triple-lens camera system instead of its previous-generation single-lens system, Mac Otakara reports. The Japanese publication also claims that the entry-level iPad could get a double-lens system instead of the traditional single-lens alternative. Mac Otakara said it has seen diagrams of accessories, which would imply that these updates to the iPad range’s camera system are legitimate. All previous iPad models have only offered a single-lens camera system on both the front and rear of the device. Both of these upcoming iPad models are expected to launch in October, according to the report. Apple is also rumoured to be introducing a triple-camera system to its high-end 2019 range of iPhones – replacing the double-camera system currently used on previous models.
