Google’s hardware division is working on new Pixelbook and Pixel Slate products, the company confirmed in a statement to The Verge. Speaking at the Google Cloud Next 2019 conference, Pixelbook Group product management lead Steven Jacobs suggested that the company would also launch a new device aimed at mobile productivity. “We think there’s some unique things we can do differently than the Pixelbook and Pixel Slate that are going to really help give them what they’re looking for when they’re working in this new modern cloud-first era,” Jacobs said. Google is expected to launch refreshed versions of its Pixelbook and Pixel Slate products this year, and Jacobs’ statements point to the launch of a new hardware product different from the conventional product lineups. Google’s Pixelbook laptop is a high-performance Chromebook with a touch screen and built-in Google Assistant – offering high-end specifications in a slim and portable form factor. There is currently no information regarding the expected release date for Google’s upcoming Pixelbook and Slate products.
