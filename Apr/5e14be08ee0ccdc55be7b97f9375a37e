Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has issued a challenge to competitor Steam to increase the share of revenue it gives to game developers. In a Twitter post, Sweeney said that if Steam committed to a permanent 88% revenue share for all developers and publishers, Epic would drop exclusives from its online store. He added that if Steam offered this revenue share, Epic Games would consider listing its own games – such as Gears of War and Fortnite – on the Steam Store. Epic Games launched its online store in December 2018, competing with Steam by offering an 88% revenue share for developers compared to Steam’s offer of a 70% revenue share. This has resulted in many popular new titles being launched exclusively on the Epic Game store instead of Steam, directly challenging the dominance of the biggest PC gaming marketplace in the Western world.
