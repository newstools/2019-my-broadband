Acer has unveiled its latest large-format gaming display, the Predator CG437K P monitor. The display features a 43-inch 3,840 x 2,160 VA LCD panel and is designed for “hardcore PC and console gaming enthusiasts”. “The 4K monitor features a fast 144Hz refresh rate for incredibly smooth and tear-free imagery, essential for tracking objects as they zip across the screen,” said Acer. Support for adaptive frame rates, a colour gamut of 90% of the DCI-P3 colour space, and HDR 1000 certification have also been packed into the display. Connectivity options include three HDMI ports, a USB-C port, and a DisplayPort. The Predator CG437K P monitor will be available in the US from September, starting at $1,299. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302820" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Display-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Display-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Display-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Display-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Kevin Lancaster is reporting from New York as a guest of Acer South Africa.
