MTN has launched its Smart S phone in South Africa for R249. The device was originally unveiled in November 2018 as the product of a partnership between MTN, Unisoc, KaiOS, and China Mobile. This new phone runs the KaiOS operating system, which is a lightweight Linux-based OS that supports WhatsApp, Facebook, and Google Assistant. The “smart feature phone” has also been bundled with inclusive data, said MTN. MTN has bundled the Smart S with “a monthly allocation of 100MB of data valid for 30 days, for first six months and 1GB of WhatsApp bundles, valid for 20 days, for first six months”[sic]. “By introducing this cutting-edge device at such an affordable price, MTN will help its customers… that may have avoided traditional smartphones due to the cost to become part of the information society at an accessible price,” said the company. The MTN Smart S is available at selected MTN retail stores and major retail partners, it added. Along with access to popular apps, the Smart S supports 3G, GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity. It also includes a web browser, front and rear cameras, FM radio, up to five days of battery life, dual-SIM, and microSD support (32GB). <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298528" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-Box.jpg" alt="MTN Smart S 3G Box" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-Box.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-Box-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-Box-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-Box-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298526" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-8.jpg" alt="MTN Smart S 3G (8)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-8.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-8-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-8-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-8-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298522" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-10.jpg" alt="MTN Smart S 3G (10)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-10.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-10-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-10-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-10-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298520" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-4.jpg" alt="MTN Smart S 3G (4)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-4.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-4-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-4-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298518" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-2.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-2-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-2-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
