Takealot has launched over 25 new collection points for customers across South Africa. The collection points, called Takealot Pickup Points, are an alternative to having your order delivered to your home or office. Customers select the “Collect” option when checking out on Takealot and then select a location from where they want to collect their order. At the time of writing, Takealot listed multiple collection points across the country – including 14 points in Gauteng. The Gauteng collection points include the new flagship Takealot customer centre on New Road in Midrand. Engen’s new “Big Bird” 1-Stop has also been launched in the New Road complex, and includes an Engen Quickshop, Wimpy, Corner Bakery, Andiccio 24, Kauai, KFC, Woolworths Foodstop, and Schoon Bakery – along with ATMs. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304004 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-640x199.png" alt="" width="640" height="199" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-640x199.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-600x187.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot.png 709w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> At the time of writing, the following pickup points were listed by Takealot: Takealot said that the collection point option will be presented to customers whose order items are all eligible for collection, and that orders of R450 or more will qualify for a “free collection”. The collection of orders which total under R450 will cost customers R25. Collection from the Takealot Cape Town warehouse is still free. Customer will have seven days to collect their order once it has been delivered to a pickup point. If the seven days have elapsed and the order has not been collected, it will be returned to the Takealot warehouse and the customer’s account will be credited. Items which are not available for collection include liquor and large appliances, stated Takealot. The company’s FAQ page states that customers may also nominate a person to collect their order on their behalf, provided they have the QR code or unique PIN linked to their order. Once an order has been placed and the collection point selected, it is not possible to change collection points or change the order to a home or office delivery, states the FAQ page. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304006" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="809" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-2.png 665w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-2-316x400.png 316w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-2-340x430.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
