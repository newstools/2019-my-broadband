AT&T claims to be the first US mobile network to achieve 2Gbps speeds on its 5G network. According to the US carrier, it achieved these speeds while using a Netgear Nighthawk 5G mobile hotspot on its live, commercial 5G network in Atlanta. If one achieved sustained 2Gbps speeds, this would allow for the downloading of a 2-hour HD movie in just 10 seconds. This announcement comes just a month after AT&T also claimed to have achieved the first 1Gbps 5G network speeds in the United States. “Reaching 5G’s ultimate potential is a journey and these milestones represent just part of the exciting moments in building a 5G world,” said AT&T in a statement. “We’re all about finding ways to unleash the full potential of 5G, including celebrating the exciting milestones along the journey.” South African mobile networks have said that they’re waiting for spectrum so that they can launch their own 5G networks.
