Microsoft has confirmed that its next feature update will be named the May 2019 update, adding that it will bring “significant changes” to the Windows update process. While previous feature updates were automatically installed on Windows 10 devices, users will now have more control over when to initiate the May 2019 update. New features in the May 2019 update aim to give users even more control over all Windows 10 updates, reducing the possibility of a new update interfering with the user experience. “We are adding new features that will empower users with control and transparency around when updates are installed,” Microsoft said. “In fact, all customers will now have the ability to explicitly choose if they want to update their device when they ‘check for updates’ or to pause updates for up to 35 days.” Users can choose to download and install updates, pause updates which are in progress at inconvenient times, and make use of intelligent active hours for update installation based on their usage patterns. The May 2019 update will be available next week in Release Preview.
