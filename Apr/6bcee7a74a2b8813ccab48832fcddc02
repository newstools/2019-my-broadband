Eskom has stated that WhatsApp messages which warn of massive strike action, with disastrous effects for the power utility, are a hoax. A voice note, allegedly from an Eskom contractor, said there are big problems at Eskom sites – with operators and other workers blocked from entering power stations. The person behind the recording said no spares and equipment needed at the power stations can be delivered. He added that they have received threats that their vehicles will be set alight and their staff will be assaulted if they try to enter Eskom sites. All their work on Eskom sites has therefore been halted – and many other contractors are following suit. According to the message, Lethabo has shut down two power generation units, Medupi one, Kriel two, and Matla may shut down three units unless they receive spares for their conveyor belts. Another WhatsApp voice note warns of a national strike which will start on 25 April – and that this will bring the country to its knees. “Eskom is aware of WhatsApp voice messages doing the rounds giving false information and creating unnecessary confusion and panic,” the company said. “Please ignore the messages, they are a hoax.” The voice notes which were circulated via WhatsApp are provided below.
