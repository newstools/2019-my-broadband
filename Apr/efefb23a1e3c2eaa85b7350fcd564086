CareerJunction has released its latest CareerJunction Index (CJI) report, which shows that there is a decline in the number of advertised IT jobs in South Africa. The CJI is based on data gathered from the CareerJunction website and monitors the labour market in South Africa by examining supply and demand trends. According to the report, the ICT sector displayed volatile demand trends during the last three quarters. What is particularly bad news for IT jobseekers, however, is that job volumes remain lower than the previous year. Some good news is that Information Technology remains the field with the biggest demand for new professionals, followed by business, management, and finance. It is also encouraging that demand for software development skills strengthened by 26% from January to March 2019. Software development and programming remain the most sought-after skill sets on CareerJunction. The graph below shows volume trends for IT job adverts published on the CareerJunction website over the past 12 months. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304436 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ICT-Jobs.jpg" alt="" width="583" height="411" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ICT-Jobs.jpg 583w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ICT-Jobs-567x400.jpg 567w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 85vw, 583px" />
