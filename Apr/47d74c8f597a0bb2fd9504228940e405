In South Africa, banking charges are one of the most important considerations when deciding which bank to sign up with. These costs are often difficult to find, however, as banks’ pricing documents tend to be long and complicated. To help simplify the process of investigating bank fees, MyBroadband has detailed how much it costs to draw money from an ATM in South Africa – based on the fees of the country’s biggest banks. Using the example of drawing R1,000, we have detailed how much you will pay in fees when using FNB, Standard Bank, Capitec, Absa, Nedbank, and TymeBank. The results are listed below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-128268 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fnb_600x400-600x400.jpg" alt="FNB logo" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fnb_600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fnb_600x400-250x166.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-165804" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Standard-Bank-logo.jpg" alt="Standard Bank logo" width="640" height="430" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164034" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capitec.jpg" alt="Capitec" width="640" height="430" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-268039" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Absa-logo.jpg" alt="Absa logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Absa-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Absa-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Absa-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-274927" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Nedbank-logo.jpg" alt="Nedbank logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Nedbank-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Nedbank-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Nedbank-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-284248" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/TymeBank-Logo-1.jpg" alt="TymeBank Logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/TymeBank-Logo-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/TymeBank-Logo-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/TymeBank-Logo-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
