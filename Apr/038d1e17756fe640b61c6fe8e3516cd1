Huawei has announced that the first-week sales figures of the Huawei P30 Pro place it on track to become the most popular smartphone in the country. The Huawei P30 Pro is the company’s latest flagship device, boasting a bezel-less display with an in-screen fingerprint sensor, an unprecedented camera system with 50x zoom capabilities, and high-end features such as reverse wireless charging and built-in artificial intelligence. Five days after its launch in South Africa, the P30 Pro showed a 244% increase in sales compared to the number of P20 Pro devices sold during the previous-generation flagship’s launch week in 2018. Sales of the Huawei P30 have also been impressive, showing a 44% increase on the number of Huawei P20 smartphones sold during its first week of sales. The Huawei P30 Pro currently sits on top of the DxOMark leaderboard with a total score of 112, making its camera the best in the world on a smartphone. Huawei’s share of the South African smartphone market has grown considerably over the past two years thanks in large part to the popularity of its P Series devices. According to GfK, Huawei moved from the number three spot in 2017 to number two last year, and the company is on track to be the number one smartphone brand in the market.
