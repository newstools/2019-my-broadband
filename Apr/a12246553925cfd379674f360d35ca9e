Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe said rotational load-shedding continues to remain a major risk and concern for the company. Speaking to employees, Hadebe said Eskomâ€™s plant performance is not at the standard where it should be. The below-par power plant performance can be partly attributed to the historical lack of maintenance. Energy analyst and EE Publishers MD Chris Yelland explained Eskom previously decided to divert maintenance funds to finish construction at Medupi and Kusile. This plan backfired because of problems at Medupi and Kusile, which means Eskom is now planning to focus its finances on maintaining older plants again. The power utility has put aside R49 billion for maintenance, which includes generation, distribution, and transmission. Eskom has also set aside R9.5 billion for Medupi and Kusile to optimise their value and add more power to the grid.
