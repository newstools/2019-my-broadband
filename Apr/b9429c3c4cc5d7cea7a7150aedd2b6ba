MultiChoice recently implemented its annual price adjustment for DStv, raising prices across most of its packages. Two packages did not have their prices adjusted, however: DStv Premium and DStv EasyView. The monthly fee for all other DStv packages were increased. The DStv Access Fee to enable video recording features on your PVR-capable decoder also increased from R90 to R95 per month. In addition to increasing prices, MultiChoice has also made several changes to its channel line-up in the past year. The monthly price and number of channels in each DStv package is summarised in the table below. The total channels exclude the DStv channel (DStv 100), and the price excludes the monthly PVR Access Fee. The table below shows which channels you get with a DStv Compact subscription. All of these channels are also included with DStv Compact Plus and DStv Premium. The following additional channels are included in DStv Compact and DStv Premium subscriptions. The following additional channels are only available on DStv Premium.
