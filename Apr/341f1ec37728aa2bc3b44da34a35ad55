Samsung could release a smaller version of its upcoming Galaxy Note 10 smartphone alongside the standard model, according to Korean publication The Bell. The report stated that while the Galaxy Note devices have traditionally featured large screens, Samsung will launch a version of the handset with a smaller screen to cater for customers who want a less bulky smartphone. Samsung also plans to increase the screen size of the main Galaxy Note model to 6.7 inches and aims to deliver the same specifications as the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G. According to the report, this increase in size has prompted Samsung to launch a Galaxy Note 10 model with a 6.4-inch screen alongside the bigger smartphone. The smaller version of the Galaxy Note 10 could reportedly only be released in European markets. The new devices are expected to be revealed in August 2019.
