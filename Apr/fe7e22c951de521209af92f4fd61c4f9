Huawei plans to offer its cloud services from a second data centre in Johannesburg, the president of Huawei’s Cloud Africa business, Rai Rui, has announced. Rui was speaking at a media briefing held during Huawei EcoConnect 2019 in Johannesburg. He said that 25% of the capacity of Huawei’s first data centre in Johannesburg was already being used by clients and once the second data centre is built, it will mean that Huawei’s public cloud will be available from at least two sites just in Johannesburg. The second data centre will not be built by Huawei, and they are looking at potential vendors for the facility. Huawei said it will launch a tender process for the new data centre next month. Huawei launched commercial cloud services from its first Johannesburg data centre at the end of February, which made it the first cloud provider with an operational data centre in Africa. It officially announced the existence of the data centre in October 2018, later stating that it plans to launch before the end of that year. Microsoft launched its South African data centre shortly after Huawei’s commercial launch, with Azure data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town now live.
