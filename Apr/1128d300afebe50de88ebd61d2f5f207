Acer has unveiled its latest hardware at its Next at Acer event in New York on 11 April 2019. Acer CEO Jason Chen gave the keynote address at the event where introduced a range of new laptops, ChromeBooks, desktop PCs, and displays. Chen started out with Acer’s domination in the Chromebook market – where it is the number one player globally – and said the company has shipped 13 million Chromebooks. Following this success, Acer is launching a new Chromebook device aimed at enterprises: the Acer Chromebook 715. The laptop features an 8th-Gen Intel Core processor, keyboard with numeric keypad, fingerprint reader, and a 100% aluminium chassis. Alongside the new Chromebook, Acer unveiled several new professional and gaming laptops. This included the new TravelMate P6, which packs an all-metal chassis, a thin-and-light design, durability with military-grade specifications, and 20 hours of battery life. New gaming laptops were also shown off by Acer, starting out with new Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 devices. Both laptops feature 144Hz displays, 9th-Gen Intel Core processors, Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics, and high RAM allotments. The new big brothers of the Nitro laptops were then shown off: the new Predator line-up. A refreshed Predator Helios 300 was revealed first, which features 9th-Gen Intel Core CPUs, Nvidia RTX 2070 graphics, a 144Hz display, and AeroBlade cooling to ensure the machine can be overclocked. Its more powerful sibling is the Predator Helios 700, Acer’s top-end gaming laptop. The Helios 700 is built with a new Intel Core i9 9th-Gen CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics, Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, Intel Optane memory, and cooling solutions which will allow users to overclock the PC. Another standout feature of the Helios 700 is its adjustable HyperDrift keyboard which can slide down to open dual fans for improved cooling. The keyboard also packs MagForce keys and linear key usage – providing a progressive key press as opposed to either a 0% or 100% press. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-302608" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Image.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Image.jpg 1000w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Image-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Image-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Image-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Acer’s new product line-up extended into the display and creative space, too, headed up by its Predator CG7 gaming display. The CG7 features a 43-inch 4K panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, is HDR certified, and provides variable refresh rate support for gaming with Nvidia G-Sync. A highlight of the event, and the reason for the “Next at Acer” name, was the unveiling of Acer’s new brand of PCs aimed at creative professionals: ConceptD ConceptD machines feature optimised cooling solutions with low noise levels, great physical designs, and powerful specifications. The range includes the ConceptD 5, 7, and 9 notebooks for 3D creation, video rendering, and design; two desktop products called the ConceptD 500 and ConceptD 900; and two displays. The display are the ConceptD CP7 – with a 27-inch, 4K IPS panel – and the ConceptD CM7 – which packs a 32-inch 4K IPS panel. Kevin Lancaster is reporting from New York as a guest of Acer South Africa.
