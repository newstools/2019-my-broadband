DStv currently offers 67 high definition (HD) channels in South Africa, with content ranging from general entertainment and sport, to documentaries and news. This extends back to when MultiChoice launched M-Net HD in 2008, using the Beijing Olympics to showcase the technology. The second HD channel on DStv was Discovery HD Showcase, which launched on 21 December 2009. DStv then launched its first dedicated SuperSport HD channel a few days later. While MultiChoice added several more HD channels to its line-up in the years that followed, it was limited by the satellite capacity at its disposal at the time. MultiChoice explained to MyBroadband that deciding whether to add more HD channels was a balancing act, as they consume the same amount of bandwidth as four standard definition (SD) channels. The pay TV operator said that nowadays the efficiency is around three SD channels for every one HD channel. When DStv got a replacement satellite in Intelsatâ€“20, and its backup satellite Intelsat-36, it said that the additional capacity available would allow enable many more services to be launched, including HD channels. The number of HD channels on the pay TV platform then exploded, climbing to the 67 high definition channels available today. All of the HD channels currently available on DStv are listed below.
