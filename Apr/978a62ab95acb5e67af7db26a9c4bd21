Numerous Ford owners are complaining that valuables were stolen out of their vehicles because of their cars’ poor security systems. According to these Ford drivers, the lock system used for their vehicles makes it easy for criminals to open their cars. Many of the victims have taken to social media to complain about the issue, but they say Ford is ignoring their concerns. The Facebook group “My Ford was broken into South Africa” has grown to 8,331 members as a result, with 6,488 people joining the group over the last 30 days. According to Ford owner Briony Simon “Ford has chosen to ignore their customer complaints about their locks clearly not being effective”. She said daily posts of people’s “Ford cars being broken into through the lock” have been posted online, but the company is not responding to these posts. She posted a photo of two Ford Fiestas and a Ford Focus which were targeted at Centurion Mall recently. These are also reports of Ford Rangers which have been hit. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303766" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fords-Targeted-big.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fords-Targeted-big.jpg 960w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fords-Targeted-big-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fords-Targeted-big-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fords-Targeted-big-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303770" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lock-broken.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lock-broken.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lock-broken-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lock-broken-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303772" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lock-broken2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lock-broken2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lock-broken2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lock-broken2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Habitat Payments director and former Dimension Data solutions architect Matthew Parker said he has “helped 345 Ford vehicles because of Ford’s defective locking system”. “Carte Blanche will be running a video with me next week to expose how easy it is to break in and hopefully Ford will now take action,” he said. “Breaking in literally takes seconds and customers are shocked at how easy it is.” Parker told The Star that “the lock complies with the correct standards but the guys use a tool that puts stress on the lock”. “When they use that tool, all the locks open on the Ford and the alarm doesn’t go off. I don’t know why,” he said. According to Parker the poor lock system issue occurs mostly in the Fiesta, Focus, Ranger, and Figo. Videos were also circulated which show how criminals targeted Ford vehicles with the allegedly poor locking system.  Ford spokesperson Minesh Bhagaloo said the company’s team of security engineers and crime-prevention specialists continuously investigate ways that vehicles are being targeted. “With this information we assess whether there are additional deterrence enhancements we can make to our vehicles in response,” said Bhagaloo. He confirmed that additional security solutions are currently being investigated for previous-generation Fiesta and EcoSport owners. He did not mention all the models Parker said suffer from a poor lock system, but did say that customer’s safety and security was important to Ford.
