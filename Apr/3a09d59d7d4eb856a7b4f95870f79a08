The Department of Home Affairs website has been unavailable for nearly two weeks without any indication of when it will be back online. The website initially displayed a message saying “The main website is currently offline. Emergency Maintenance as 10 April 2019”. The website linked to a few Home Affairs services which were still online, including its online application process. The holding page has since disappeared and the website is now completely offline, giving the error message “The requested URL could not be retrieved”. The Department of Home Affairs continued to post pictures and videos of Minister Siyabonga Cwele on Twitter, but did not mention its website downtime. The images below show what visitors to the Department of Home Affairs website were greeted with over the last two weeks. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303848 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Home-Affairs-Website-640x315.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="315" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Home-Affairs-Website-640x315.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Home-Affairs-Website-600x296.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Home-Affairs-Website-768x378.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Home-Affairs-Website.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303850" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DHA.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="508" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DHA.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DHA-504x400.jpg 504w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DHA-768x610.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DHA-542x430.jpg 542w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
