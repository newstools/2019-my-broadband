While flagship smartphones are becoming increasingly expensive, mid-range and budget devices are evolving on a yearly basis. These cheaper handsets are constantly updated with modern designs and hardware, and many resemble the flagship smartphones of a few years prior. Fierce competition in this pricing bracket in the South African market also means that local buyers can get great deals on the latest mid-range smartphones. Huawei dominates the mid-range smartphone sector in South Africa, said the company, with its P30 Lite device expected to top sales in 2019. Other major manufacturers such as Sony and Samsung have also released new mid-range smartphones which deliver sleek, modern designs and great value. To find the best deals, we compared contract options on the latest mid-range devices in South Africa â€“ selecting those which were priced at under R300 per month. It should be noted that mobile operators do not stock all devices, while others offered the handsets we compared, but only on contracts priced at over R300. The best smartphone contracts priced at under R300 per month are listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300606" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Lite-header.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 Lite header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Lite-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Lite-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Lite-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302156" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A30.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A30" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A30.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A30-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A30-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-294076" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Huawei-P-Smart-2019.jpg" alt="Huawei P Smart 2019" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Huawei-P-Smart-2019.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Huawei-P-Smart-2019-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Huawei-P-Smart-2019-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297922" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019.png" alt="Huawei Y7 2019" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302160" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sony-Xperia-L3.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia L3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sony-Xperia-L3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sony-Xperia-L3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sony-Xperia-L3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
