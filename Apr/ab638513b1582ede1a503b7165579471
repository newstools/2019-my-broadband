Russian defence company Almaz Antey has patented a design for a drone that shoots down other autonomous aircraft with an automatic shotgun. The drone was built by students at the Moscow Aviation Institute and is constructed to frame the body of an automatic Vepr-12 shotgun with a 10-round magazine. Unlike conventional drones, this aircraft takes off and lands from a tail-sitting position while flying with the shotgun muzzle pointed forward. The drone is controlled by a pilot wearing a virtual reality headset and they aim the weapon using an onboard camera. From these controls, the pilot can target and destroy drones and other targets with the shotgun. This product is currently only built for demonstration purposes.
