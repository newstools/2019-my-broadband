Nokia has launched its X71 smartphone, which boasts a 48MP triple-camera and Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor. The smartphone is an Android device and runs a near-stock version of the operating system. It is also guaranteed to receive at least two years of OS upgrades. Despite its mid-range processor, the Nokia X71 boasts 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage along with a bezel-less display and punch-hole front camera. A capacitive fingerprint sensor is placed on the back of the device and the smartphone also features a 3.5mm audio jack. The Nokia X71 will launch in Taiwan for $385, but GSM Arena reports that it could arrive in Western countries under the name Nokia 8.1 Plus. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-301560" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nokia-X71-1-640x349.jpg" alt="Nokia X71 1" width="640" height="349" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nokia-X71-1-640x349.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nokia-X71-1-600x327.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nokia-X71-1.jpg 727w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
