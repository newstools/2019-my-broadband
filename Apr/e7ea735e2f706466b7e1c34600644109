WhatsApp is working on a feature to prevent frequently-forwarded messages from being sent to group chats. According to WABetaInfo, WhatsApp is testing the feature in an Android beta version of the application. The feature stops “Frequently Forwarded Messages” from being sent to a group, and is aimed at combating fake news. “This option will be available in future in Group Settings, and only administrators can see and edit it. If you are an admin and you don’t like this feature, you can choose to keep it disabled,” stated the report. “When the feature is enabled, nobody will be able to send a frequently forwarded message in the group. Yes, obviously a user can copy the frequently forwarded message, sending it as a new message, but this action will slow the process.”
