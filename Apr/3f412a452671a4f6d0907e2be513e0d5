A car auction essentially consists of bidders attending an auction where they compete with other bidders, trying to bid higher than the subsequent bid. The auction ends when there are no more bids, allowing the buyer with the highest bid to collect their car. WeBuyCars currently have an average of 100 cars available per auction, giving you a wide variety of options to choose from. They are hosting car auctions every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at their Midstream branch, and every Monday at their Johannesburg South branch. Prior to the auction, you have the option to thoroughly inspect all the auction cars. If you desire to buy an auction car before the auction has officially started, you can buy the car with their “Buy Now” option. It is important to note that by doing this, you are still buying the car on their auction terms. If you are drawn towards convenience and looking for a great deal on your next car, buying a car on auction might be the solution. Buying a car on auction can save you both money and time. And the best part is, you get to determine the purchase price. WeBuyCars is constantly focusing on improving the speed and convenience of their service in order to accommodate your needs.
