SABC chief operating officer Chris Maroleng has been found guilty on three charges following a disciplinary enquiry initiated late last year, City Press reports. Maroleng faced an enquiry into charges of gross negligence and breaching fiduciary duty, which the report stated could lead to his dismissal. The SABC also enquired into Maroleng’s alleged protection of acting SABC executive for sport Marchi Mahlalela, who resigned from the SABC following her own disciplinary hearing. Maroleng reportedly leveraged his position to try and assist Mahlalela in being hired at Saru (South African Rugby Union), even writing a letter in his official capacity at the SABC which confirmed that Mahlalela was innocent of any wrongdoing. The SABC did not agree with Maroleng’s assessment, stating in its own letter to Saru that the COO does not represent the broadcaster’s stance on the matter. Maroleng’s attorney stated that the disciplinary process was not yet finalised, and that Maroleng would make a submission to the SABC on the issue of sanction soon. The new SABC board members recently appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa will have the job of disciplining Maroleng for his actions. The report stated that Maroleng’s charges constitute a reason for dismissal, and the members of the board will need to determine whether this will be their course of action regarding the COO. The SABC’s new board members include professionals with expertise across a variety of fields, including business practice, law, journalism, communication, and more.
