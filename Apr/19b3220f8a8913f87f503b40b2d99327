Elon Musk announced that Tesla will offer more aggressive driver assistance modes in the future, including one that has a “slight chance of a fender-bender”, The Verge reports. He added that the carmaker would have to have more confidence in its self-driving technology before it could roll out an aggressive Autopilot option like this, however. “Do you want to have a nonzero chance of a fender bender on freeway traffic?” Musk asked at an investor event on Monday. He called the aggressive driver assistance option “LA traffic mode”, saying that it was the only way to navigate traffic in Los Angeles. It should be noted that Tesla already offers various levels of driver assistance for highway driving, including “Mild”, “Average”, and “Mad Max” Autopilot modes, the latter of which switches lanes quicker than other options. Musk also said that Tesla had dropped Nvidia’s self-driving hardware in favour of its own in-house chip, which he called the “best chip in the world”.
