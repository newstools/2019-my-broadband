Microsoft has launched its “All-Digital” edition of the Xbox One S, which removes the disc drive gamers typically see in a modern console. The discless Xbox One will go on sale for $250 in the US on 7 May 2019 and includes three games at launch – Minecraft, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 3. Microsoft will also offer buyers a discount on Xbox Game Pass, the subscription service which provides access to over 100 games. Existing Xbox One accessories and digital copies of games users already own will also work on the console. Microsoft added that an Xbox Live Gold subscription will be required to play online multiplayer titles and access Games with Gold titles, as is the case with current Xbox One consoles. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
