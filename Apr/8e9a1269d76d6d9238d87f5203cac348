Technology evolves and becomes more intelligent every year. Because of this it’s no longer optional to use the best equipment in every department of your business. This includes printers as document input and output can massively influence workflow, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Printer performance can also affect the security of a network environment if it is vulnerable to threats, as they often contains business-critical information – either on the printer itself or on printed pages – which can provide intruders with access to other devices on the network. To combat this, IT professionals and senior decision makers must prioritise print security and align it with their core business objectives.
