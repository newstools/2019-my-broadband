WhatsApp has added a new update to the beta version of its app which shows that it is working on a new feature concerning archived chats, WABetaInfo reports. Currently, chats which have been archived are hidden in the application until a new message arrives from that chat – at which point it is automatically unarchived by WhatsApp. The beta version of the app includes a new option called “Ignore archived chats”, which can be toggled on or off from WhatsApp’s notification settings. When enabled, archived chats won’t be unhidden when new messages arrive and will need to be manually restored by the user themselves. WhatsApp will also add a new “Archived” section to the main chat screen which allows you to change this option. This feature is not currently available, but it is expected to launch soon for the beta version of the application.
