President Cyril Ramaphosa recently called on young white South Africans not to leave the country in a pre-election campaign drive in Stellenbosch. He said that the fears that many white South Africans have of not being wanted, “is entirely not true”. “There is a place, there is room for all of us,” the president said. The problem of professionals leaving South Africa, however, extends far beyond the young white population. Many qualified people are leaving the country in search for a better future for themselves and their families. MyBroadband’s 2019 IT Salary Survey revealed that 46% of IT professionals in South Africa are planning to leave South Africa permanently, or work abroad, in the near future. The survey was conducted in April and was completed by 3,055 respondents from a wide range of IT professions and companies. The main reason for IT professionals planning to leave South Africa is political and economic concerns about the country. Other prominent reasons for people planning to leave the country is crime, better living standards abroad and a better future for their children. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303834" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IT-Professionals-Leave-SA-1.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IT-Professionals-Leave-SA-1.jpg 641w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IT-Professionals-Leave-SA-1-600x359.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IT-Professionals-Leave-SA-1-640x383.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  The feedback from this survey echoes the views of IT professionals who have already left South Africa. It also gives a clear indication of what should be done to keep IT professionals of all colours from leaving the country. The survey clearly illustrated that IT professionals are not overly concerned about the very high tax burden in South Africa. They are therefore happy to help build the country and transform the economy, and all they require is a safe and stable environment free of corruption, crime and discrimination.
