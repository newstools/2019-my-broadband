ASUS has unveiled its new high-end ROG Strix III range of gaming laptops. The new Strix Scar III and Hero III were inspired by a concept called “Face Off” that was the result of ASUS and BMW working together to envision the future of laptop design. The design includes a sizable ridge on both sides of the laptop, as well as a third ridge at the back of the Strix III laptops. They also feature gamer-focused LEDs and a dedicated light bar. Also included in these laptops is ASUS’ own ROG Keystone, which uses NFC technology to allow users to unlock secret and encrypted storage on the laptops. The Strix III range offers powerful performance targeted at gamers, including 9th-generation Intel CPUs – maxing out at the Core i9-9880H. Additionally, the laptops come with Nvidia RTX 2070 graphics cards, and can be fitted with either a 144Hz or 240Hz 1080p display. These displays come in 15.6-inch and 17-inch versions. ASUS has also announced a cheaper model – the Strix G – which still offers graphics up to the RTX 2070, but uses the i7-9750H processor. It also won’t feature the light bar or the ROG Keystone technology.
