MTN has carried out extensive radio and transmission upgrades on its network ahead of the long weekend, it said. These changes include the rolling out of new base stations to remote areas that were without connectivity before, as well as performing technology upgrades on selected 3G and 4G base stations around major national roads. In addition it has installed L900 technology, which can enhance indoor network coverage. In holiday hotspots such as Cape Town and Durban, MTN expects network upgrades to result in sustained and good performance even during increased traffic demand periods such as the Easter weekend. “The investment MTN South Africa has made in its network over the past several years has left the operator fully prepared for the expected shift and increase in Easter season voice, SMS, and data traffic,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive for corporate affairs at MTN SA. MTN will also implement temporary mobile base stations to provide added capacity in areas where the installation of permanent sites is incomplete, or where temporary capacity is required.
