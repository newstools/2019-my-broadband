According to a tweet by Apple leaker Steve Troughton-Smith, Apple is planning to split various iTunes features into separate apps. “I am now fairly confident based on evidence I don’t wish to make public at this point that Apple is planning new (likely UIKit) Music, Podcasts, perhaps even Books, apps for macOS, to join the new TV app,” said Troughton-Smith. Troughton-Smith believes that each of these new apps would be Marzipan apps, meaning that they would work across all Apple operating systems. Apple has not mentioned unbundling iTunes, but it is likely that it will happen at WWDC 2019 if the leaks are true. This follows the company recently launching various other new apps, including Apple TV+ and Apple News+.
