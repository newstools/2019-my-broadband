Cisco South Africa has launched a R10-million Incubation Hub in Durban, which will help develop SMMEs and speed up their entry into the digital marketplace. The Incubation Hub is a smart building that offers complete business facilities, including workspaces with high-speed broadband connectivity, video conferencing and collaboration platforms, and boardrooms and training facilities. “We are living in a world that is changing faster than ever imagined and we are inspired by the prospect of an economy with abundant jobs, a place where entrepreneurs can thrive,” said Clayton Naidoo, GM for Cisco Sub-Saharan Africa. “With technology comes many opportunities, especially in Africa, the fastest-growing region in the world. Cisco recognises Africa’s talent and we want to continue being an enabler of tech ecosystems across the continent,” Naidoo added. The centre will also provide SMMEs the opportunity to employ graduates from Cisco’s Networking Academy, giving them work experience.
