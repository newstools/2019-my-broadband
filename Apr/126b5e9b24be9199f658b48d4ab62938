Alan Barrett will be leaving his role as AFRINIC chief executive officer on 26 July 2019, the organisation has announced. “I have taken the difficult decision to leave AFRINIC, after four years as CEO. I have been both proud to serve the African community, and humble to realise how small my own contributions have been,” Barrett said. “Any success that AFRINIC has enjoyed has been the result of a joint effort by many people, including the previous CEO, our dedicated and talented staff, board members past and present, our vibrant community, and volunteers who serve on various committees.” Barrett said that much work remains to be done to make Internet access affordable, open, and available throughout Africa. “I firmly believe in AFRINIC’s vision to be the leading force in growing the Internet for Africa’s sustainable development, and I have every confidence that the board and staff will continue to work towards that goal.” Alan Barrett is an Internet pioneer in South Africa, and was part of the group of people who helped establish South Africa’s first TCP/IP link to the United States in 1991. Barrett later cofounded the country’s first Internet service provider – The Internetworking Company of Southern Africa (TICSA). TICSA later became UUNET Internet Africa, which was acquired by Verizon in 2006 and traded as Verizon Business. MTN bought Verizon Business South Africa in March 2009. AFRINIC thanked Barrett for his dedication, commitment, and outstanding contribution to the global and African Internet community. It will launch a search process for a new CEO as soon as possible, it added.
