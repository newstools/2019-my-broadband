Google has added support for editing Microsoft Office files directly within its suite of cloud-based apps, TheNextWeb reports. While Google Docs users were previously relegated to installing a plugin or converting Office files to edit them without limitations, users can now simply open Office files and edit them without any restrictions. All Google Docs features – including multi-user collaboration – will be available when editing Microsoft Office files. Google Docs supports the .doc, .docx, and .dot file formats for Microsoft Word; .xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, and .xlt for Excel; and .ppt, .pptx, .pps, and .pot for PowerPoint. This feature will begin rolling out to a limited number of Google Docs users this month, and this rollout will be extended to more users from May 2019.
