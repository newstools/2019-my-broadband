Load-shedding has a devastating effect on mobile networks, with a big increase in site outages and dropped calls being reported when Eskom cuts the power. Apart from the impact of batteries running down during stage 4 load-shedding, there is a big increase in theft and vandalism of base stations by criminals when load-shedding hits. Speaking at the 2019 MyBroadband Mobile Network Conference, MTN’s general manager of engineering Zoltan Miklos said load-shedding is a nightmare for networks. Miklos said that MTN has seen a 580% increase in power downtime in March 2019 compared to a year ago. The increase in power outages results in more mobile sites going down, which in turn means that more subscribers must be served by sites which are far away from them. It is therefore not surprising that there is a significant decline in network availability and a big increase in dropped calls during load shedding. The two charts below clearly show the impact of load-shedding on mobile networks in South Africa. The chart below shows the big increase in power outages on MTN’s network at the beginning of the year when stage 2 to 4 load shedding hit the country. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303056" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Power-Outages.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Power-Outages.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Power-Outages-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Power-Outages-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Power-Outages-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The chart below shows the impact of load-shedding in January to March 2019 on network availability and the dropped call rate (DCR). <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303060" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Network-issues.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Network-issues.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Network-issues-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Network-issues-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
