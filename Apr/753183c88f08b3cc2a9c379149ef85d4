The Competition Commission intends to publish a provisional report concerning the state of data services in South Africa. “The Commission will invite submissions on the provisional report and will then engage in further consultations with key stakeholders before completing its assessment,” it said in a statement. The report is set to be released by 30 April. This follows an inquiry which was launched in August 2017 that sought to discern whether there are “features of the sector that prevent, distort, or restrict competition”. In October 2018, the Competition Commission held public hearings to deepen its understanding of the state of competition in the data services sector. The inquiry was originally slated to be completed by 31 March 2019, but upon the Commission’s decision to further analyse evidence this date was amended to 31 December 2019.
