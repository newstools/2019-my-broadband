The stakes have risen for Netflix Inc. since the last time the video-streaming pioneer reported earnings. With more than four new entrants to the Internet TV gauntlet, investors will look to chief executive officer Reed Hastings during the conference call for reassurance. Netflix is scheduled to release first-quarter results after markets close Tuesday, with Wall Street projecting subscriber additions of 1.61 million in the U.S. and 7.33 million internationally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s slightly higher than Netflix’s forecast of 1.6 million and 7.3 million, respectively. Wall Street is braced for a softer forecast as phasing of the effective price hikes is expected to mostly weigh on second quarter subscriber adds. Other factors, such as a lighter content slate and competition from Disney’s “Avengers” film and HBO’s final season of “Game of Thrones,” are also expected to contribute to a tepid view. While Netflix may have taken a hit from the forthcoming Disney+ platform, losing $8 billion in market value since last week, analysts still consider Netflix to be the streaming leader. Moreover, many of the yet-to-be-launched services are seen as a value add for the streaming industry. Netflix shares have risen more than 30 percent year to date, despite expectations of a conservative second quarter. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-303366" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pricing-in-Perspective-640x360.png" alt="Pricing in Perspective" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pricing-in-Perspective-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pricing-in-Perspective-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pricing-in-Perspective-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pricing-in-Perspective.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
