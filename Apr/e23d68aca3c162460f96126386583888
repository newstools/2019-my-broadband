The MultiChoice Group said it will not carry content that includes Steve Hofmeyr on any of its platforms. This comes after MultiChoice requested a music video which was nominated for a Ghoema Music Award which featured Hofmeyr to be withdrawn. Hofmeyr music video, Die Land, also featured Bok van Blerk, Jay, Ruhan Du Toit and Bobby van Jaarsveld. MultiChoice Group Executive Corporate Affairs, Joe Heshu explained that the company did not want Hofmeyr to form part of the Ghoema Music Award event as his views are not aligned with MultiChoice’s values. “We welcome a society where freedom of speech is celebrated, however we take a stand against racism,” said Heshu. This stance was criticized by Hofmeyr, Afrikaans artists and commentators, with calls to boycott MultiChoice and DStv over their role in Hofmeyr’s removal from the awards. MultiChoice, however, stood firm and is now doubling down on its decision. The company told Channel24 that it “won’t air future Steve Hofmeyr content he might appear in and will try to prevent the broadcast of any archive material in which he features”. Hofmeyr hit back against MultiChoice’s Ghoema Music Award decision, saying the company is now aligning itself with the state which is corrupt and racist. “White people, their language, and their cultural heritage have become playthings for the fascists,” he said. “We have been handed over to the “revolution” and half of our people are on their side.” He thanked people who supported him and who were also “shocked” by the hijacking of the arts by the state and the business sector.
