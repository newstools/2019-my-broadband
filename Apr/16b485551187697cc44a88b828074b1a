Samsung has announced a new 42-inch QLED TV named The Sero, which can be flipped 90 degrees to display Instagram, Snap and other smartphone-based media in its native format. The Sero is aimed to appeal to the millennial generation’s infatuation with smartphones, offering a mobile-esque viewing experience on a large scale. While it is in its horizontal mode, The Sero functions just like a standard QLED smart TV with a 4K resolution. Once it is flipped to its vertical orientation however, the display can be paired with your smartphone via NFC and mirror the content on your handset. The official specifications of the device have not been confirmed, but the unique TV will form part of Samsung’s lifestyle art range, which includes the Serif and the Frame TVs. Currently, the Sero is only set to release in Korea for around $16,300, and there is no information regarding an international launch date for the rotatable TV. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-304592" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Sero-1.jpg" alt="The Sero 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Sero-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Sero-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Sero-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
