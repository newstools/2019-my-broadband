Samsung has launched its new line-up of QLED TVs in South Africa, which includes a monstrous 8K QLED TV. The 2019 QLED range comprises one 8K model and four 4K smart TV models across four different series, each of which has a different set of features. Samsung’s 8K Q900 QLED Smart TV boasts AI-powered upscaling features in addition to HDR support, and is available in a range of sizes, from 65-inch to 98-inch. The QLED 2019 range also includes the high-end Q90, Q80, and Q70 4K smart TVs, which include HDR support and direct full array backlighting for increased contrast and more even brightness. Like the more expensive models, Samsung’s Q60 4K Smart QLED TV also boasts HDR support and Ambient Mode, which allows the TV to blend into the wall behind it when not active. Samsung launched its new QLED TV range at an event in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg on 23 April 2019. The QLED TVs are currently available for pre-order in South Africa and will launch from 25 April. The TVs will start from R19,999 for the cheapest 4K QLED 2019 model, while the 8K Q900 QLED TV will be priced from R76,999. For a limited period from 24 April to 5 May 2019, customers will receive a Samsung soundbar with every 2019 QLED TV they purchase. All QLED purchases also come with Samsung Signature Service which includes delivery and installation. The specifications and local prices for Samsung’s 2019 QLED TVs are below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303974" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900.jpg" alt="Samsung Q900" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303976" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q90R.jpg" alt="Samsung QLED Q90R" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q90R.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q90R-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q90R-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303978" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q80R.jpg" alt="Samsung QLED Q80R" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q80R.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q80R-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q80R-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303980" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q70R.jpg" alt="Samsung QLED Q70R" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q70R.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q70R-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q70R-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303982" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q60R.jpg" alt="Samsung QLED Q60R" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q60R.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q60R-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q60R-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
