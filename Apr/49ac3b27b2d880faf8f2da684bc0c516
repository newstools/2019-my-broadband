Facebook will only release its upcoming “clear history” tool between September and November this year, reports Engadget. The tool, which was previously slated to become available by the end of May, will allow users to clear information about themselves on their Facebook account. Facebook VP of integrity Guy Rosen said the reason for the delay is that Facebook wants to release a comprehensive and thorough product. “We’re working to re-engineer our systems, and how we process that data so that we can do it right,” said Rosen. “That’s why it’s taking more time than anticipated.” Facebook first mentioned the feature at the beginning in May 2018 at its F8 conference, but at the time there was no confirmed release date for the feature. Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has warned users that this tool will impact their Facebook experience in a similar way to when you delete your cookies. “You may have to sign back in to every website, and you may have to reconfigure things. Your Facebook won’t be as good while it relearns your preferences,” said Zuckerberg.
