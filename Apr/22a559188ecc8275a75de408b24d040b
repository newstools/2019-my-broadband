MTN has launched its Bundle Bonanza promotion for new prepaid customers, giving users who recharge with R20 or more free data, minutes, and SMSs. New customers who recharge with at least R20 within the first seven days of the promotion will receive 50MB of data, 50 all-network minutes, and 50 free SMSs. After this time period, prepaid customers who buy voice, data, or integrated bundles through any recharge channel will receive an extra bundle as part of the price plan promotion. For example, customers who purchase voice bundles will also receive promotional data bundles, while customers who buy data bundles will receive a voice bundle in addition to their standard bundle. Customers who buy integrated bundles will receive the equivalent integrated bundle with similar validity periods. MTN added that new prepaid customers will be charged a call rate of R0.99c per minute, an out-of -bundle (OOB) rate of R0.29c, and R0.50c per SMS. “In a tough economic climate, we want to keep adding value for our customers, helping ease the pressure on their pockets, while also rewarding them for their loyalty to MTN,” said MTN South Africa executive for corporate affairs Jacqui O’Sullivan. “We have made significant investments in our network to deliver the best coverage and speeds in the country and this added value will help keep our customers on our world-class network, connected to their work, home, communities and families.” MTN Bundle Bonanza will be available to all new MTN prepaid customers and those who have ported to the MTN network from 16 April 2019.
