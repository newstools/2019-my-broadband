Sony has built a massive new TV display which boasts a resolution of 15,360 x 8,640 and is longer than a bus, BBC News reports. This 16K television boasts 16-times as many pixels as a 4K UHD TV and 64-times as many pixels as a standard 1080p display. The company announced that the massive TV screen is being installed at a research centre for Japanese cosmetics group Shiseido during its NAB trade show. The 16K display is 19.2 metres long and 5.4 metres tall and will stretch between the first and second floors of the research centre once installed. Sony built the TV to showcase its new Crystal LED display technology, which aims to compete with OLED and Micro LED technologies. The company is not expected to launch commercial 16K TVs any time soon, as it will take a while for this technology to become available to everyday consumers.
