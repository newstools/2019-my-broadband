A former student at The College of Saint Rose in New York has admitted to using a USB device to destroy the circuitry of campus computers, causing $58,471 worth of damages. The former student, Vishwanath Akuthota, could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, reports The Verge. He has also agreed to pay back the full amount of damage he caused to Saint Rose’s computers. Akuthota inserted the “killer USB” device into 66 computers on the New York college campus, and reportedly recorded himself doing so – which helped the FBI to catch him. USB devices like the one Akuthota used are easily available to purchase online, and seek to overload the surge protection present in many PCs. Akuthota is an Indian citizen who was in the US on a visa after having earned his masters degree in business from the college in 2017.
