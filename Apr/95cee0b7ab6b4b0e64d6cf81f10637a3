Microsoft has dropped the default option to “safely remove” USB drives in the latest version of Windows 10. The default policy for removable storage devices in the Windows 10 1809 build is now Quick Removal, which negates the need to safely remove USB drives before unplugging them. This means that users can simply unplug their USB device without fear of losing data. Windows 10 users can still select the “Better performance” policy in the operating system’s Disk Management settings, which requires users to conduct the “safely remove hardware” action before removing an external storage device. The “Better performance” option allows Windows 10 to cache disk write operations to improve disk write speed and the “safely remove hardware” process protects the integrity of data on the device by making sure that all cached operations finish.
