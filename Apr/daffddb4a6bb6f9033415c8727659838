VAST Networks has developed technology which provides shopping centres, restaurants and retailers with accurate data about their customers and their habits. VAST is an open-access Wi-Fi network infrastructure provider which delivers carrier-grade Wi-Fi in South Africa. The company is well-known for providing Wi-Fi access in airports, shopping centres, restaurants and retail stores. However, the most valuable service provided to its business clients is not Wi-Fi access. Instead, it is extensive data about these businessâ€™ customers. VAST has built a platform, called Loxion, which provides its Wi-Fi customers with a visualised and actionable data set that can be used to improve operations. This anonymous data gives businesses insight into how many customers visit them, when and for how long they visit, how often they return, and who they are. While some of the data relies on people using the network, most of the information is gathered through Wi-Fi enabled smartphones. Here are some examples of the data that VAST Networks provides to its business clients. The Loxion dashboard provides businesses with visitor trends in their establishments, like average visit duration, new visitor trends, busiest times and customer loyalty. It also provides some demographic information like gender, age and what devices their clients use. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303084" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="930" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard-275x400.jpg 275w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard-768x1116.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard-296x430.jpg 296w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Businesses can gain insight into their visitor trends by combining the VAST visitor data with additional information like weather patterns and promotions. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303086" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="1039" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard2.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard2-246x400.jpg 246w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard2-768x1247.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Loxion-Dashboard2-265x430.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303094" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Visitor-trends.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="544" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Visitor-trends.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Visitor-trends-471x400.jpg 471w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Visitor-trends-768x653.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Visitor-trends-506x430.jpg 506w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Valuable demographics data is provided by the Loxion dashboard such as gender, age and device used. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303090" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Demographics.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="1166" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Demographics.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Demographics-220x400.jpg 220w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Demographics-768x1399.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VAST-Demographics-236x430.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Businesses can easily visualise their visitor trends and see when their busiest hours are so that they can ensure they have enough staff on the floor at all times. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303092 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Busiest-hours-640x347.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="347" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Busiest-hours-640x347.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Busiest-hours-600x326.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Busiest-hours-768x417.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Busiest-hours.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
