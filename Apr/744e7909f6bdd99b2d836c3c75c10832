Aston Martin has revealed its first all-electric vehicle – the Rapide E. The automaker officially unveiled the sedan at the Shanghai Auto Show on 16 April, stating that only 155 of the new cars will be produced. The Rapide E is powered by an 800V, 65kWh battery which will allow it to travel over 320km on a single charge, and twin electric motors mounted on the car’s rear axle deliver 450kW of power. Aston Martin said the vehicle will be able to accelerate from 0-60 mph in under four seconds, making it faster than the Rapide S combustion equivalent of the vehicle. The Rapide E was first announced in 2015 and was initially expected to reach production in 2018, but Aston Martin’s manufacturing partner LeEco pulled out of the venture in 2017. Formula One team Williams will now help to bring the car to market, although Aston Martin has not yet announced a price and official shipping date for the Rapide E. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303272" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-1.jpg" alt="Aston Martin Rapide E 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303274" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-2.jpg" alt="Aston Martin Rapide E 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303276" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-3.jpg" alt="Aston Martin Rapide E 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Aston-Martin-Rapide-E-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
