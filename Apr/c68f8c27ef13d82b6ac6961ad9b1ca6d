Game of Thrones fans in China are frustrated with the amount of censorship imposed on the show, the South China Morning Post reports. Season eight of Game of Thrones will be streamed on Tencent Video in China, which has exclusive distribution rights to the show. The version screened in China is notably different however, with scenes featuring graphic violence and nudity being censored heavily or cut entirely. Users on Chinese social media platform Weibo begged Tencent not to censor the show too much, with others stating that the censored version of the show is not as interesting. To circumvent this censorship, many Chinese Game of Thrones fans have turned to VPNs and torrent websites to stream or download uncensored versions of the episodes.
