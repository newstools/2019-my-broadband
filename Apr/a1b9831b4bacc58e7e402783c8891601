Internet Solutions clients which use the company’s Consumer Virtual Machine (CVM) service to host data have been experiencing problems with accessing their data, following downtime due to “hard disc” failures. Clients were first notified of the outage just after 20:00 on 18 March, and after a week of downtime MyBroadband readers wrote to complain about the matter. Earlier this month, Internet Solutions told clients that it was working to add additional hardware to its CVM platform and resyncing the environment to restore data to its original state. Some CVM clients told MyBroadband that they are still unable to access their data, however, even though the CVM environment has now been restored by the company. The outage affected less than a quarter of clients using the CVM platform, said IS, leaving them unable to access databases and other information which they had stored within the virtual environment. Restoration of the CVM platform took longer than anticipated, with clients unable to access their data for weeks. Following questions from MyBroadband, Internet Solutions confirmed that the CVM service is back up, although it has encountered problems reinstating data. “The Consumer Virtual Machine platform was restored following the implementation of remediation measures,” Internet Solutions said. “Regrettably, a portion of data could not be reinstated to a consistent state – i.e. attaching the data back to the original virtual machines.” Internet Solutions said this data was still available, but clients would need to contact the provider to retrieve their information. “The data still exists within the environment and we have advised affected clients of the alternative methods to retrieving their data,” Internet Solutions said. “We would like to remind clients who may not have access to certain data to contact us on newvm@is.co.za with their preferred data retrieval option.”
