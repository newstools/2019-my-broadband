The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has found that renewable energy helped combat load-shedding in the first quarter of 2019. The CSIR said that variable renewable energy (VRE) helped to relieve pressure on the South African power grid and was a major factor in avoiding further load-shedding. Causes of load-shedding during 2019 have been cited as unplanned plant failures combined with the loss of imported power from Mozambique. This resulted in the most intensive load-shedding ever experienced in the country, with 595GWh shed in March alone. The CSIR noted that renewable energy contributed 2,975GWh (5.3%) to the South African power system in the first quarter of 2019, proving instrumental in combating the severity of load-shedding. “Without the variable renewable energy fleet, load-shedding stage 5 and 6 could have been invoked,” the CSIR said. The graph below details the effect of renewable energy on the load-shedding crisis in South Africa in Q1 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-303648" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CSIR-VRE-load-shedding-640x366.jpg" alt="CSIR VRE load-shedding" width="640" height="366" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CSIR-VRE-load-shedding-640x366.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CSIR-VRE-load-shedding-600x343.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CSIR-VRE-load-shedding-768x440.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CSIR-VRE-load-shedding-1200x687.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
