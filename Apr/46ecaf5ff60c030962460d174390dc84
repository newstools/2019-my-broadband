ICASA has published its findings and position following an inquiry into its role and responsibilities in cybersecurity. It believes there is a provision in the Electronic Communications Act that empowers it to play a role in the cybersecurity space in terms of network reliability and information security. The authority also resolved that it needs to collaborate with public and private sector organisations. “ICASA believes that regulating a safe cyberspace is of public interest and as such, it is the duty of the state and its agencies to ensure that South Africans are safe on the cyberspace,” said ICASA. “The overall position of ICASA is that cybersecurity is a multi-faceted concept and a multi-stakeholder approach; therefore enabling legislation is required to clarify roles and avoid duplication of resources.” ICASA acknowledged that there are legislative processes underway – including the Cybercrime and Critical Infrastructure Bills – which relate to elements of cybersecurity and could affect how it is dealt with in the future.
