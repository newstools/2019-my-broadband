Michael Page has released its 2019 salary trends survey for South Africa, detailing how much professionals earn in the country. The company said that the local labour market has “once again been unpredictable”, despite a short recovery in the first half of 2018. The official unemployment rate is back at its 2017 level due to weak investment and consumer confidence, it said. There is some hope, however. “With the economic stimulus package announced in September 2018 and a heightened commitment to attract foreign investment, we are expecting a positive economic impact on the GDP growth and the unemployment rate for 2019,” it said. Part of the salary report looks at the IT industry, which Michael Page said will be one of the drivers of growth in the country. In terms of salaries in South Africa, it stated that wages and bonuses have “tended to follow a consistent pattern over the past five years, with steady increases to reflect inflationary pressures”. “In the current market, there are a number of candidates with niche skill sets or relevant experience who are able to command higher salaries, due to a low supply of talent.” The table below details the average “Technology” salaries earned in South Africa in small-to-medium enterprises and multinational companies.
