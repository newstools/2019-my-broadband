The next time you have trouble with mosquitoes, you might want to break out a subwoofer and some Skrillex instead of the bug spray, according to a study published in Acta Tropica. Scientists assessed the behaviour of mosquitoes when exposed to electronic music – specifically the song “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites” by Skrillex – and found that the mosquitoes were far less likely to feed on humans when the music was played. “The occurrence of blood feeding activity was lower when music was being played,” the study stated, adding that “females entertained with music attacked hosts much later than their non-entertained peers”. The experiment seems to be based on the interaction between low-frequency vibrations and the disruption of signals between conspecifics and hosts. Scientists said that these observations open new avenues for the development of personal protection against mosquito-transmitted diseases.
