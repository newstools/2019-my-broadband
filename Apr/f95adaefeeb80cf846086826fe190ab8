Microsoft has released a Windows Insider Preview build for Windows 10 which allows you to display your Android smartphone’s notifications on your PC. Users who download Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 18885 will receive a number of new features for the Your Phone app, including support for notifications and Samsung’s Galaxy S10 smartphones. “Stop reaching for your phone to check your notifications,” Microsoft said in the release notes for its latest build. “Boost your focus and productivity by seeing your phone’s notifications on your PC.” Users can control which Android applications they receive notifications from on their PC, and dismissing a notification on one device will also cause it to disappear from the other. The latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build will roll out to Insiders over the next few days, and the notifications feature for the Your Phone app support Android devices running version 7.0 or later with at least 1GB of RAM.
