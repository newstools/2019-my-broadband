Samsung launched its new QLED TVs in South Africa this week, which include a range of 8K displays for an excellent viewing experience. The Samsung 8K TVs – under the Q900 range – come in four sizes, all of which support AI-powered upscaling features and HDR. Leading the line-up is the Samsung 98-inch Q900, a giant display with a price tag to match. The sizes of the 8K TVs and their South African pricing are listed below: Samsung said that all its new TVs will launch in South Africa from today – and until 5 May 2019 those who purchase a new QLED TV will receive a Samsung soundbar for free. Delivery and installation will also be included, added Samsung. The Samsung 98-inch Q900 recently made headlines when it launched internationally, thanks to its $100,000 price tag – making it one of the most expensive TVs on the market. It features a 97.5-inch display with a resolution of 7,680 x 4,320 with HDR 10+ support, backlit by Samsung’s QLED technology. This is 16-times the resolution of Full HD. There is not much 8K content in the market today, however, which Samsung is aware of – and to remedy this its TV comes with 8K AI Upscaling. This “revolutionary upscaler” remasters content into 8K, said the company, and is powered by the TVs “Quantum Processor 8K”. Samsung has also included features such as automatic adoption, which adapts the TVs brightness and sound to match the conditions of the room it is in, and an “Ultra Viewing Angle” to reduce glare for viewers. Additionally, SmartThings smart home integration, the Bixby voice assistant, smart speaker compatibility, Ambient Mode (which blends the TV into its surrounding by display various images), and FreeSync support are included. The Samsung 98-inch Q900 is shown in the images below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304218" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-4.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="479" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-4.jpg 789w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-4-534x400.jpg 534w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-4-768x575.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-4-574x430.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304214" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="479" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-2.jpg 789w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-2-534x400.jpg 534w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-2-768x575.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-2-574x430.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304216" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="479" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-3.jpg 789w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-3-534x400.jpg 534w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-3-768x575.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-3-574x430.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304212" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="479" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-1.jpg 789w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-1-534x400.jpg 534w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-1-768x575.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TV-1-574x430.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
