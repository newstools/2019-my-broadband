Huawei’s annual Eco Connect event, which brings together business leaders, global industry visionaries, opinion leaders, partners and potential partners, took place earlier in April this year at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg. The event is focused on giving delegates an in-depth overview of how Huawei can help them expand the boundaries of business within the South African market in 2019. In its fifth year, Huawei Enterprise Eco Connect saw major uptake, with over 1,200 delegates in attendance. This is compared to the number of guests at the inception of the event – where there were only 80 guests. The event offered a host of presentations from key Huawei speakers with break-away sessions, and an exhibition area where partners and distributors were able to promote their brands and services as well as network with their peers. At the event Huawei Enterprise highlighted its vision for the year ahead, which encompasses their plans to contribute to a fully connected, intelligent world. The company plans to do this by bringing digital to every person, home, and organisation through research and development, and will invest no less than 15% of sales revenue on research and development in the coming years. According to the president of Huawei’s Cloud Africa business, Rai Rui, Huawei Enterprise is also planning on expanding its cloud service offering through a second data centre in Johannesburg. To end off the 2019 Eco Connect event, Huawei Enterprise hosted its prestigious gala dinner awards ceremony, where the company division awarded 16 partners in the categories of Networking, IT, UCC, Service capability, Certification, Training and Development, Distribution, SME, Digital Transformation, VAP, and Global Partners of the Year.
