Oracle has officially launched its new office building, which is situated in Woodmead, Johannesburg. The new facility is equipped with”future-proof technology” which the company claims will “deliver an exceptional experience and better support the digital transformation journeys of South African public and private sector entities”. It is also a 4 Green Star-rated building, which means it enables the active monitoring of energy, water, and waste consumption to drive efficient use. “Our new workplace is an investment in the future of our customers, employees and the next generation workforce of South Africa,” said Oracle South Africa MD Niral Patel. “We have created an inclusive space that will encourage innovation, foster learning and inspire organisations to achieve more.” This follows the November 2018 opening of Oracle’s first South African Innovation Hub in Johannesburg. Pictures of the new building are posted below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-303216" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Night-View-640x320.png" alt="New Oracle Building - Night View" width="640" height="320" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Night-View-640x320.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Night-View-600x300.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Night-View-768x384.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Night-View.png 950w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-303218" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Front-View-640x320.png" alt="New Oracle Building - Front View" width="640" height="320" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Front-View-640x320.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Front-View-600x300.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Front-View-768x384.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/New-Oracle-Building-Front-View.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
