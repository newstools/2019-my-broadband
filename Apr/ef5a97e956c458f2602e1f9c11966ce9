Nvidia could be working on a new 2-in-1 Shield gaming tablet which can switch between tablet and desktop modes, XDA Developer reports. Nvidia’s Tegra X1 chipset powers a number of products, including the Nintendo Switch, but the latest generation of this hardware line may powers a new gaming tablet from the company. Code within the latest Shield Experience software points to the development of a new desktop mode feature for a new product which is code-named “Mystique”. According to the report, Mystique may be a 2-in-1 PC like the Microsoft Surface Book which is aimed at portable and desktop gaming. The upcoming product will reportedly support Dynamic, Tablet, and Desktop UI modes, and could feature a 13.5-inch 3,000 x 2,000 LCD display along with a Tegra Xavier chipset for high-performance mobile computing.
