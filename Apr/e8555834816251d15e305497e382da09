A new visualisation of global mobile data prices, produced by Howmuch.net, shows that South African mobile data prices are more expensive than most African countries. The visualisation uses data from 6,313 mobile data plans in 230 countries which were gathered and analysed by Cable.co.uk between 23 October and 28 November 2018. The average cost of one gigabyte (1GB) was then calculated and compared to form a worldwide mobile data pricing league table. The data reveals that Rwanda offers the cheapest at $0.56 per GB, followed by Sudan ($0.68) and the DRC ($0.88). South Africa was ranked 40th out of 60 African countries listed in the report at $7.19 per GB of mobile data. The full data set and an interactive map is available here: 2019 Mobile Data Prices. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304092" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-data-prices.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="577" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-data-prices.jpg 1700w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-data-prices-444x400.jpg 444w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-data-prices-768x692.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-data-prices-477x430.jpg 477w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mobile-data-prices-1200x1081.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
