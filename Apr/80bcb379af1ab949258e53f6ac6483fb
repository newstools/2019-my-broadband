Huawei recently held its annual Eco Connect event in Johannesburg, bringing its partners and their customers together under one roof. During the keynote address, the managing director for Huawei Enterprise South Africa, Alex Du, said that Eco Connect is currently in its fifth year. “That first year we invited 80 guests,” he said. “Today we are going to host 1,200 guests, with no fewer than 1,000 people here during peak hour.” In addition to offering a full programme of presentations and break-away sessions, Huawei Eco Connect 2019 also has an exhibition area where partners and distributors were able to promote their brands and services. Exhibitors said that they chose to attend Eco Connect because Huawei was a key partner that they wished to support. The event also offered a great opportunity to showcase their capabilities and network with their peers in the industry, they said. Asked why they had selected Huawei as a partner, some said they had selected Huawei’s products and services to complement their existing offerings or bridge gaps in their portfolios with solutions based on solid technology. Others said they chose Huawei simply because it has the best product for their needs. A video highlighting the feedback from exhibitors and attendees at Huawei Eco Connect 2019 is embedded below.
