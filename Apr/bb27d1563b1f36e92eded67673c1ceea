My Xerox printer won’t print! We hear this statement at the customer support centres and on the Community Forum but that statement does not tell us or anyone that is trying to help you what they need to know. So let’s take a look at some things to check that might help narrow down your focus to what might be causing the no print. You might be asked about these check points by customer support or you might want to go through this list first before you contact support. Make sure to read them all, no skimming or skipping! These are the basics that we look at when we see the issue of “will not print”. If none of the items above help in your situation then it may be time to go to the Forum and ask for help or contact your local support centre.by phone, email or chat, if available. Be sure you provide as much information as possible on your set up, operating system, driver version, type of connection and what, if anything, has changed since the last time it printed properly. I hope this list has given you an idea of what to look for and where to start when your printer does not print. Every situation is different, so these are general things to look at or try. For more specific information search the support page for your device, contact your local support centre or post your situation on the Community Support Forum.
