Earlier this month, Motherboard reported that hackers had breached a Microsoft Outlook customer support portal and accessed users’ metadata and email content. Now the publication has said that numerous victims of the breach claim to have had their cryptocurrency wallets accessed by these hackers. Jevon Ritmeester, a user who was alerted by Microsoft about the breach of his account, claimed that hackers used their access to his email to withdraw Bitcoin from his Kraken exchange account. According to Ritmeester, the hackers implemented an email forwarding rule that sent any email which mentioned “Kraken” to their own Gmail account. The hackers reportedly used this system to reset his password and access his account before stealing just over one bitcoin – which is worth about R74,000. Two other Reddit users claimed that they have also lost cryptocurrency as a result of the Microsoft Outlook hack. “Customers who believe they have been impacted beyond what was outlined in the company’s notification should contact the Microsoft support team for assistance, ” a Microsoft spokesperson told Motherboard.
