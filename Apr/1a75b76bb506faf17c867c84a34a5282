Vodacom launched its best-ever data deal on 5 April – 30GB anytime data, 30GB bonus anytime data, and 30GB after-hours data (12am – 5am) for R299 per month. This promotion is available on a 24-month contract and includes a R10,000 Top Dog educational voucher. The Top Dog educational website features a range of fun learning materials aimed at Grade 4-12 learners. Resources include animated lectures, mock exams with solutions, live chat sessions with teachers, online tests with instant results, plus subject summaries and tutorials. While the 24-month contract may scare off some people, it comes with a benefit – it guarantees that subscribers will get 60GB anytime data (30GB plus 30GB bonus data) for the duration of the contract. Vodacom said the promotion will be available until 6 May 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303724" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vodacom-deal.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vodacom-deal.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vodacom-deal-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
