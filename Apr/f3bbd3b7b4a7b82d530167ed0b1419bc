The Dutch Reformed church in Redelinghuys burned down this morning, leaving the town without cellular reception. Redelinghuys is a small town in the Bergrivier Local Municipality in the Western Cape province, which is home to around 581 people in 167 households. The Dutch Reformed church was formed in 1906 and the building which burned down was opened in 1927. The church housed cellular antennas, base stations and other telecoms equipment belonging to Vodacom, MTN and Openserve. According to eye witnesses they saw smoke from the church tower early on Tuesday morning where some of the equipment is housed. West Coast districtâ€™s chief fire officer Bertus Senekal said the fire, which completely destroyed the church, could have been started by short-circuit in the tower.
