Huawei has released its P30 smartphones, and they look ready to take on Samsung’s recently-launched Galaxy S10 line-up. Samsung launched its Galaxy S10 and S10+ smartphones in February 2019, offering a new display design with a cutout for the front-facing camera as well as an in-screen fingerprint sensor. Huawei soon followed with its two new flagship smartphones: the P30 and P30 Pro. Their displays are also almost completely bezel-less, with Huawei minimising the top and bottom bezels and removing the front speaker in favour of a sound-on display solution which vibrates the smartphone’s screen to produce audio. Both smartphones also include in-screen fingerprint sensors and OLED displays. When it comes to internal hardware, the devices boast powerful, refined chipsets created by Samsung and Huawei themselves. The Huawei HiSilicon 980 and Samsung Exynos 9820 Octa trade blows fairly competitively across various applications and both include dedicated neural processing units to enable unique AI functionality. Samsung greatly expanded its camera offering with the Galaxy S10 line-up, boasting an array of three cameras on the rear of the Galaxy S10+. Huawei has also focused heavily on its camera system for the P30 Pro this year and the cutting-edge camera system on the Huawei phone has claimed top spot in the DxOMark rankings. The P30 Pro features an array of three cameras with a fourth time-of-flight (TOF) lens off to the side. The full specifications of the Samsung and Huawei phones are below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300640" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-vs-Huawei-P30-Pro.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S10+ vs Huawei P30 Pro" width="640" height="480" /> Both the Huawei P30 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10+ are premium smartphones built on the cutting edge of mobile technology. Samsung has pushed for the integration of its Bixby digital assistant again, including a physical Bixby button on the side of the device – which can be remapped – and has included a 3.5mm audio jack. The Huawei P30 Pro omits both the headphone jack and physical digital assistant button in favour of a simpler design and an EMUI operating system more similar to stock Android 9.0 than Samsung’s One UI software. Both smartphones also include reverse wireless charging, IP68 durability, OLED displays, and at least 8GB of RAM. The Galaxy S10+ does support Samsung Pay, making it the preferred option for those who want to make payments with their smartphone, but Huawei has said its Pay app will launch in South Africa this year and the P30 Pro would probably be among the first smartphones to support the platform. The local pricing for the two models we compared is below: Pricing is a major concern for many South African buyers and while the phones are closely matched, Huawei wins easily in this category – coming in much cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S10+. The images below show the Galaxy S10+ and P30 Pro side-by-side. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-301398"
