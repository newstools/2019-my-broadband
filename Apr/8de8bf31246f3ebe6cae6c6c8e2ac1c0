Samsung recently unveiled its new Galaxy A Series smartphones in South Africa. While many of the smartphones compete in the mid-range market, the Galaxy A80 sits at the top-end of the line-up and is far more of a flagship than a middleweight competitor. While Huawei’s P30 looked set to undercut Samsung’s flagship smartphone pricing in South Africa, the highest-end Galaxy A80 has now thrown a wrench in the works. Priced at slightly cheaper than the P30, the Galaxy A80 includes similar features and a unique bezel-less design which boasts a better screen-to-body ratio than its Huawei competitor. The Galaxy A80 is expected to launch in South Africa in June 2019, and ahead of this we compared the Samsung device against the Huawei P30. Despite its non-flagship branding, the Samsung Galaxy A80 competes directly with the Huawei P30 in terms of hardware. Both devices sport Full HD+ OLED displays, although neither features the curved glass implemented on the Huawei P30 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S10. The smartphones also boast powerful camera systems and 128GB of internal storage, with the Galaxy A80 including 8GB of RAM – 2GB more than the Huawei P30. Huawei’s device beats the Galaxy A 80 in terms of processor power however, as it packs the latest Kirin 980 processor from Huawei. Samsung’s Galaxy A80 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 CPU, which is comparably weak compared to a flagship-grade chipset inside the P30. The full specifications of the devices are below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303348" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-vs-Galaxy-A80.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 vs Galaxy A80" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-vs-Galaxy-A80.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-vs-Galaxy-A80-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-vs-Galaxy-A80-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The standout features of the new phones are their cameras, which differ wildly in their implementation. The A80 sports a motorised rotating triple-camera array which functions both as a primary and front-facing camera. This means that the front of the device is completely bezel-less when the rear camera is used, and once the selfie button is pressed the camera lifts and rotates 180 degrees to become a front-facing camera. The design is a unique solution to the problem of the “notch”, which Huawei has tackled in the traditional manner by including a small cutout at the top of its display with a 32MP front-facing sensor. In terms of flagship features, both devices offer an impressive range of capabilities, such as in-screen fingerprint sensors, AI-enabled camera functionality, and advanced image stabilisation. Samsung’s Galaxy A80 also supports Samsung Pay and the manufacturer’s Knox security platform, while the P30 packs an extremely powerful camera system and AI-powered chipset which benefits from an onboard NPU and GPU Turbo support. Looking at pricing, Samsung’s Galaxy A80 is expected to land in South Africa with a price tag of R12,999 – while the Huawei P30 is available for R13,999.
