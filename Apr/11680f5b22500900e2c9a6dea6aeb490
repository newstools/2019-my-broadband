378 Cell C employees who engaged in an illegal strike and blocked other employees and customers from entering and leaving Cell C’s premises have been suspended and face disciplinary action. Cell C told MyBroadband that it was granted an interdict to prevent the striking employees from blocking the access and exit to the campus, among others. The suspension followed two ultimatums that were issued on Wednesday by management requesting staff to desist from blocking the Cell C campus and return to work. “Striking employees failed to comply with both ultimatums leaving Cell C with no choice but to suspend them,” the company said. The company will hold a mass hearing on 15 April 2019 which forms part of the disciplinary action. Cell C dismissed information circulated that the strike action and planned disciplinary hearing significantly influenced its operations. “Cell C is fully operational,” the company said in response to questions from MyBroadband. The letter below was distributed to striking staff, warning them that if they continue to engage in strike action and do not return to work they would be suspended pending a disciplinary hearing. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303008" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="587" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter.jpg 1010w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter-436x400.jpg 436w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter-768x704.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter-469x430.jpg 469w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
