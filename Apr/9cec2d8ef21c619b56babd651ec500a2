Takealot has launched dozens of pickup points across South Africa, including a flagship centre on New Road, Midrand. The New Road collection point is now open as part of a beta test before an official launch next month, and MyBroadband ordered a keyboard from Takealot to test the collection facilities. To collect an item, customers must select the collection option when checking out on Takealot. They will then be presented with a list of pickup points across the country – including 14 points in Gauteng. Orders of R450 or more will qualify for a “free collection”, while the collection of orders which total under R450 will cost customers R25. Customers will then have seven days to collect their order once it has been delivered to a pickup point. We ordered a keyboard from Takealot on 24 April at 08:39, selecting the New Road pickup point as our collection option before paying for the item. As our order was over R450, no collection fee was applied. After placing the order, Takealot’s website presented a page which said our item should be ready for collection from 26 April. We also received an email stating that the collection will be ready from this date. Just before 11:00 on 25 April, however, we received an SMS and email which said that our keyboard was ready for collection. The email contained the details of our order and stated that we have until 3 May to collect it. The email also contained a QR code and a 12-digit PIN, either of which must be used at the pickup point to verify that we are indeed legitimate customers. Finally, the email listed the business hours of the New Road pickup point for the next seven days – which was 06:00 to 20:00 on weekdays, 11:00 to 17:00 on Saturday, 08:00 to 17:00 on Sunday, and 11:00 to 17:00 on 1 May, which is a public holiday. The New Road pickup point is part of the Engen “Big Bird” 1-Stop complex which has been constructed on the New Road turnoff on the N1 South. In addition to the Takealot collection point, the complex features an Engen Quickshop, Wimpy, Corner Bakery, Andiccio 24, Kauai, KFC, Woolworths Foodstop, and Schoon Bakery – along with ATMs. The photos below provide a visual guide to using the Takealot pickup point. After taking the New Road turnoff, you drive to a parking lot in front of the pickup point. There is dedicated parking in front of the Takealot building. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304254" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Parking.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Parking.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Parking-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Parking-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Parking-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Clear signage shows you which building to enter and where in the complex to park. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304270" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-sign.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-sign.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-sign-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-sign-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-sign-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304266" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-building.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-building.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-building-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-building-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-building-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304248" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Doorway.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="589" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Doorway.jpg 675w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Doorway-435x400.jpg 435w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Doorway-467x430.jpg 467w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> As soon as you enter the building, you are presented with a bank of tablet terminals and a reception desk. A Takealot employee greeted us and said we must scan the QR code in our email at a terminal. The QR code was in an email displayed on an iPhone X and it was zoomed in on to occupy the whole smartphone screen – but the QR code scanner could not pick up the code. We then entered the PIN, which worked straight away. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304260" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet-entrance.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet-entrance.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet-entrance-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet-entrance-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet-entrance-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304262" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tablet-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304252" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Main-entrance.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Main-entrance.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Main-entrance-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Main-entrance-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Main-entrance-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304250" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Entrance.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Entrance.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Entrance-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Entrance-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Entrance-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> A large display at the collections desk confirms that your PIN is valid and displays your name. I was then asked to take a seat in the waiting area. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304244 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Board-1-640x423.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="423" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Board-1-640x423.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Board-1-600x397.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Board-1-768x508.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Board-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304256" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seating.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seating.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seating-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seating-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seating-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> A highlight of the test was the epic spiral conveyor belt in the collection point which delivers your package. The structure is made of polished steel around a large blue pole, with lighting accentuating the curves of the contraption. What took place behind the scenes is unknown, but after about a minute of waiting the conveyor belt started up and a Takealot box made its descent to the collections desk. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304258" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spiral.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spiral.jpg 675w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spiral-300x400.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spiral-323x430.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304246" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Conveyor.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Conveyor.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Conveyor-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Conveyor-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Conveyor-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Once our order was down the belt and ready, the large display instructed us to visit “Desk 4” to get our package. We were then asked by an employee at the desk to provide our signature on a tablet, and were handed our package. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304264" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-board.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-board.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-board-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-board-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-board-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> After collecting our package we returned to the office. While it is impossible to provide an objective review of the pickup point due to our infatuation with the spiral conveyor belt, fetching our order from the New Road beta site was pleasant, quick, and smooth. The placement of a multitude of stores around the pickup point was another plus, and we grabbed a Kauai smoothie for the road. For Gauteng residents who want or need to collect packages as opposed to having them delivered, this Takealot pickup point may be your first choice. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304268" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-package.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-package.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-package-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-package-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Takealot-package-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
