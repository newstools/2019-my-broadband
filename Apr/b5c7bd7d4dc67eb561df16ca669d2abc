Microsoft has made its latest Edge preview builds available to download, allowing Windows 10 developers to try out the new version of the browser based on Google’s open-source Chromium project. The company has released its Canary and Developer builds for the browsers, which are designed to help developers become acquainted with the new platform ahead of its official roll-out. Last year, Microsoft confirmed that its new Edge browser would be built on the Chromium web rendering engine, which is the same engine used by Google’s Chrome browser. The developer version of the new Edge browser looks and functions similarly to Google’s Chrome browser, although Microsoft is still working to add a number of unique features to the platform. Canary and Developer builds of the new browser are available for Windows 10 64-bit operating systems from the company’s Microsoft Edge Insider page, with support for Windows 7, Windows 8, and MacOS planned in future. Beta builds of the new Edge browser aimed at consumers are expected to become available in the next few months.
