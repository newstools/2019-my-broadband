The Q1 2019 MyBroadband Insights mobile network quality report revealed that Bloemfontein, Irene, and Groenkloof enjoy the highest average mobile speeds. The report is based on 345,700 mobile speed test results which were gathered through MyBroadband’s mobile speed test apps. MyBroadband’s Android and iOS speed test apps enable users to test their download speed, upload speed, and latency. MyBroadband’s Speed Test platform was developed specifically for South Africa, and all tests are done to servers hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres. The latest version of the app has also added a new feature: the ability to rate your mobile operator or your Internet service provider after you have completed a speed test. The latest MyBroadband Insights mobile network quality reveals that residents in Bloemfontein, Groenkloof, Irene, Waterkloof, and Umhlanga enjoy the highest average mobile speeds. It should be noted that these are average speeds, which means they include speed test results from all operators in that area. The table below therefore shows the areas where all operators have a fairly good performance.
