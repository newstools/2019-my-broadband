The Verge reports that a cheaper version of the Nintendo Switch gaming console will be released later this year. The rumour, which was originally reported by Japanese publication Nikkei, also suggests that while the console is focused on enabling portable gaming, owners will still be able to connect it to their TVs. Additionally, a more powerful, next-gen Switch is only going to be released at a later stage, claimed the report. An enhanced Switch has previously been rumoured by The Wall Street Journal to be coming out later this year. Both versions were first rumoured back in March, which saw Nintendo shares climb by 6.8% on a single day â€“ the biggest climb the company had seen since August 2018. Nintendo has also cut its Switch shipments forecast for the past fiscal year to 17 million units, which is lower that its earlier projection of 20 million.
