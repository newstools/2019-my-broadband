OneDayOnly has been found guilty of displaying misleading pricing by the Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB). The ARB made the ruling following a complaint from a shopper who stated that a deal on the site for a “Car Hands-Free Aux Audio Receiver” was a “false claim”. The receiver, shown below, was advertised on OneDayOnly for sale at R149. This was down from its “retail” price of R400 – and therefore constituted a 63% discount. The complainant said that when he saw the deal he searched for the product on other websites, and found the same receiver for sale on Takealot for R112. In response to the complaint, OneDayOnly told the ARB that although it is not a member of the regulatory body, it will provide feedback. It stated that the receiver’s retail price of R400 was established by its “buying team”, which conducted comparative research on the item. OneDayOnly added that the receiver was for sale at the following prices on competing sites: It argued that its retail pricing and subsequent discount were therefore accurate. The ARB considered the evidence before it and conducted its own research into the pricing of the receiver. It found that the item was available at the following prices online: The body stated that the retail price of the item cannot be listed as R400 if it is not sold for this price at other outlets. The “confusingly” fluctuating Takealot pricing can therefore not be considered, while it was established that the PC Link Shop pricing was for an “imported version” of the item. The ARB therefore agreed with the complainant that the pricing of the receiver was misleading. However, as the deal in question had expired, “no further steps” were necessary. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302222" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OneDayOnly-Header.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OneDayOnly-Header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OneDayOnly-Header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OneDayOnly-Header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
