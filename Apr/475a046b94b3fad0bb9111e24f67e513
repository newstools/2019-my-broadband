Intel has warned that its 14nm chip shortage is likely to continue into the third quarter of 2019, reports Ars Technica. Reports by Gartner and the IDC have both suggested that the lack of Intel processors is part of the reason behind the decline of the PC market, while Microsoft has claimed that its performance has also been hampered by Intel’s processor issues. Intel’s 14nm problems have forced it to take unusual measures, such as releasing new chips based on the previous-generation 22nm process to free up capacity requirements on its 14nm range. Intel claims that it is in the process of building a 10nm chip stockpile for testers, which suggests that these chips may begin shipping as soon as the third quarter. This would help to reduce Intel’s 14nm chipset issues substantially, and in combination with a $1.5-billion investment in machinery for its 14nm chip production, would hopefully mean the end of its shortages.
