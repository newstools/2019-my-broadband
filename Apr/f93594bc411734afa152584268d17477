Apple has cut the price of its HomePod smart speaker across the world without disclosing its reason for doing so. The HomePod price has dropped from $349 to $299 in the US, from £319 to £279 in the UK, and from AU$499 to AU$469 in Australia. Speculation is rife about Apple’s reasoning, with two possible answers gaining traction. Some believe that this price reduction could be preemptive ahead of a possible Apple HomePod 2 launch. However, given that there was no mention of a new HomePod at Apple’s March event, it seems more likely that a new HomePod will be released at the end of this year, or even in 2020. Another possibility is that Apple’s HomePod is struggling to compete with Amazon and Google’s smart speakers – and Apple hopes a price cut will encourage more people to purchase the device. The HomePod has not been made available in South Africa by Apple.
