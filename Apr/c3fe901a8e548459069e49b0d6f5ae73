A vulnerability in EA’s Origin gaming platform left its users vulnerable to hackers, TechCrunch reports. The bug, which only affected Origin’s Windows users, allowed hackers to use the popular online gaming platform’s own URL system to launch any app on the target’s computer. Security researchers Daley Bee and Dominik Penner showed TechCrunch how through Origin’s URL system, hackers could run apps at the same privilege level as normal users. They proved this by opening the build-in Windows calculator app. However, hackers could also potentially run tools such as PowerShell, which is often used by attackers to create a backdoor for additional malicious files. John Reseburg, an EA spokesperson, told TechCrunch that a fix was released on Monday.
