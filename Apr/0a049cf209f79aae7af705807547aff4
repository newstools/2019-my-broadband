Valve is preparing to launch a new virtual reality headset named Index, according to a teaser image posted on the Steam Store. The image shows a pair of hands holding a Valve-branded VR headset which is branded as the Index. Inspecting the source code of the page reveals a caption underneath the image which reads: “Upgrade your experience. May 2019”. This points to a reveal of the product from Valve next month, although there is no confirmed information available about the device’s features. The teaser image shows a conventional-looking VR headset with two front-mounted cameras and an adjustment dial.
