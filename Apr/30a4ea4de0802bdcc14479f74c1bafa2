US network Verizon has launched its 5G consumer network ahead of schedule across Chicago and Minneapolis. According to Engadget, the 5G connection provided by Verizon at this point is scarce, but when one finds a coverage area it is incredibly fast. Engadget said that it recorded speeds of around 450Mbps, and sometimes as much as 600Mbps – in line with what Verizon claims its network is capable of. However, when the Engadget journalist walked into a coffee shop they immediately struggled to connect to 5G, with nothing more than a pane of glass affecting their connection strength. Verizon did not clarify how many 5G nodes have gone live in Chicago and Minneapolis, but did clarify that it hadn’t added new nodes since the original network launch.
