Disney has released new information about its upcoming streaming service, which seeks to compete with the likes of Netflix, TechRadar reports. The streaming service will use a similar interface to Netflix, showing users recommended and new content in a tiled format. Additionally, there will be five specific hubs for content from the company’s major franchises: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic. The service will be available on most smart TVs, as well as in web browsers and on mobile devices. Disney has also confirmed specific partnerships with Roku and Sony to publish its content on their respective platforms. Disney also announced that all 30 seasons of The Simpsons will be available on Disney+ at launch, alongside releases such as Captain Marvel, Disney’s Signature Collection, all Pixar shorts, and a new live-action version of Lady and the Tramp. Disney+ will release in the US on 12 November, and will cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. No South African pricing or release date has been announced. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-302834" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Disney-640x369.jpg" alt="Disney+" width="640" height="369" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Disney-640x369.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Disney-600x346.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Disney-768x443.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Disney.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
