Qualcomm has announced that it will release three new CPUs for mid-range smartphones. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 includes the company’s fourth-generation AI engine, which offers twice the AI processing power of its predecessor. Thanks to lower power usage and faster Computer Vision, the Snapdragon 730 allows smartphones to capture 4K HDR videos in portrait mode and with bokeh effects. It also features the Qualcomm Adreno 618 GPU and the Vulkan 1.1 graphics library, which uses 20% less power than previous graphics libraries. The Snapdragon 730G is a gaming version of the 730, and offers up to 15% faster graphics rendering than the Snapdragon 730. The chipset supports “true HDR gaming,” and was designed in collaboration with popular mobile game studios to ensure that it is optimised for the most popular mobile games. Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon 665, which is a chipset designed for cheaper mid-range smartphones. This cheaper octa-core processor still offers powerful features like on-device AI processing and support for triple-lens camera systems. All three processors are expected to enter the market in mid-2019.
