As of Google Chrome version 70, the browser offers support for built-in Picture in Picture (PIP) functionality, which can greatly improve your viewing experience. When watching videos on certain platforms such as YouTube within Chrome, users can double right-click on a video and select Picture in Picture mode to view the clip in the bottom-right of their screen while they continue browsing. As noted by TechDows, this feature is not limited to YouTube and online content, and can be used to view certain local files. This means that you can use Google Chrome as your media player for videos stored locally on your Windows 10 PC, allowing you to take advantage of the PIP windows to continue browsing while watching. To do this, you will need to navigate to the directory your video file is stored in and Shift + right click on the file to select the Copy to Path option. Users can them open Chrome and paste the file path in the URL bar to bring up the video in the browser. From here, they can right-click the video to switch to PIP mode.
