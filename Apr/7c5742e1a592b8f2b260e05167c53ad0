The Raspberry Pi team has released a keyboard and mouse designed for use with its Raspberry Pi computer. The three-button optical Raspberry Pi mouse includes a USB type-A connector and uses Omron switches to “give the click the best quality feel”. The Raspberry Pi keyboard then offers a three-port USB hub for external devices, such as the Raspberry Pi mouse and USB drives. It measures 284 x 121 mm in size and weighs 269g. “We went through many prototype revisions to get the feel of the keys right, reduce the light leaks from the Caps Lock and Num Lock LEDs and the surprisingly difficult task of getting the colours consistent,” said senior principal engineer at Raspberry Pi Simon Martin. They keyboard will come in six different languages: English (UK), English (US), French, German, Italian, and Spanish. These new peripherals are available from approved resellers on the company’s product page. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
