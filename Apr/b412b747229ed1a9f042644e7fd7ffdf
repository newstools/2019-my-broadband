OnLeaks and CashKaro have published leaked renders of an upcoming premium smartphone from Motorola. According to the images, the smartphone will use a four-lens system for its rear camera. It will also use a small tear-drop notch – much like that of the OnePlus 6T – for the purpose of housing its front camera. OnLeaks also said that the rumoured Motorola smartphone is expected to have a 6.2-inch display and an in-display fingerprint sensor. If the renders are anything to go by, the leaked smartphone would also have a 3.5mm audio jack and a USB-C charging port. The leakers expect that Motorola will position this smartphone as competition to flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S10. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-301704" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-2-640x360.png" alt="motorola render 2" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-2-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-2-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-2-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-2-1200x675.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-301706" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-1-640x360.png" alt="Motorola render 1" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-1-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-1-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-1-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-1-1200x675.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-301708" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-4-640x360.jpg" alt="Motorola render 4" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-4-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-4-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-render-4-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-301710" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-3-640x360.png" alt="motorola render 3" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-3-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-3-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-3-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-3-1200x675.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/motorola-render-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
