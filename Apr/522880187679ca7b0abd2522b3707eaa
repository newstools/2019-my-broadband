Google has expanded its two-factor authentication offering for Android smartphones, making it even easier to authenticate your account logins. The company announced in a blog post that you Android smartphone can now be used as 2FA key when logging into another device, with users authenticating the login attempt by simply holding down the volume button on their smartphone. To activate your smartphoneâ€™s built-in security key, you will need a handset running Android 7.0 or above and a Bluetooth-enabled ChromeOS, macOS X, or Windows 10 computer with a Chrome browser. Google said that once Android users have added their smartphone to their Google Account and enrolled in two-step verification, they can add their device as a security key in their two-step verification settings. Once this is completed, users can authenticate login attempts by holding down the volume down button on their smartphone when prompted.
