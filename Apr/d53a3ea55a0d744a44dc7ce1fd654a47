In an interview with GSMArena, Huawei CEO Richard Yu said that Huawei will transition into the development and sale of more foldable smartphones. When asked whether half of all Huawei smartphones would be foldable in the next few years, Yu said it was difficult to say for its entire smartphone range. “I think that on a flagship level in two years, half of our devices could be foldable,” said Yu. Yu said that he uses the foldable Mate X as a primary work phone and he really enjoys the user experience. “It’s really useful having the larger screen when reading charts and graphs, or just for browsing the web.” Huawei’s Consumer Business Group is continuing to accelerate its growth at remarkable rates after a successful 2018, added Yu. Yu said the company’s growth through January and February was 50% higher than for the same periods last year.
