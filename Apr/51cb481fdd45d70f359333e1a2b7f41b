Physical video games sales are still doing well in South Africa, despite the rise of digital platforms. This is more true for console games than PC titles however, as the latter have migrated mostly towards platforms like Steam and Origin for a consolidated and cheaper experience. Physical copies of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One games are still in high demand however, despite the fact that most games need to be downloaded these days, with very little data being stored on the physical disc. MyBroadband spoke to local online retailers Takealot and Raru about their physical video game sales to determine which titles were the most popular among South African buyers. The list of best-selling titles from Takealot points to a sustained demand for new releases on console as well as continued interest in firm favourites like GTA V and the FIFA franchise. Takealot’s list of PC titles comprises fewer new releases however, and reflects the country-wide phenomenon of relatively low demand for physical copies of new PC games. The same is true for Raru’s best-selling video game rankings, with demand remaining strong for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One games. Raru director Neil Smith told MyBroadband that not many physical versions of new PC game releases arrive in South Africa anymore. “Sometimes these new releases would only be available for a very short time period, as in the case of The Division 2 on PC,” Smith said. “Also the PC releases we do see would only be Code in the Box versions.” He added that there is still a demand for the physical versions of PC games, but said most of Raru’s customers would be looking for the special, deluxe, or collector’s editions of certain games, in addition to any extra pre-order bonuses there might be. Popular physical PC games in South Africa including the Sims 4 and its expansion packs, Farming Simulator, the Call of Duty franchise, and World of Warcraft. When it comes to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One titles, South African bestsellers include FIFA 19, Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto V, and Far Cry New Dawn.
