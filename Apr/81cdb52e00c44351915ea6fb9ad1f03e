The State Information Technology Agency (SITA) has appointed Ntutule Tshenye as acting CEO following the departure of Setumo Mohapi last week. “SITA welcomes Mr Ntutule Tshenye, as its Acting CEO from 1 April 2019,” said SITA. “Mr Tshenye’s track record in leadership and the technology field makes him the ideal interim candidate to lead SITA, while we undertake an appropriate recruitment process to replace Dr Setumo Mohapi.” Mohapi vacated the position after his contract ended, citing health issues and the demands of the CEO position as reasons for his departure. Mohapi served as CEO for four years, making him the longest-serving CEO in the organisation’s history. Tshenye is now the 19th SITA CEO in 20 years, with the agency struggling to retain its leadership for extended terms. “SITA will be advertising the position of CEO in the near future,” it said.
