Huawei has begun rolling out a software update for its P30 Pro smartphone which enables its long-awaited dual-view recording feature, XDA Developers reports. The company spoke about the future release of this feature when it first launched the P30 Pro, and it has now released an update to support the functionality. Dual-view video recording allows Huawei P30 Pro users to record standard and zoomed-in videos at the same time. The update is currently only available in China but it should reportedly roll out to the rest of the world in the coming days. The Huawei P30 Pro’s camera system is rated by DxOMark as the best smartphone camera in the world with a DxOMark rating of 112, and has received acclaim for other features such as its remarkable 50x zoom.
