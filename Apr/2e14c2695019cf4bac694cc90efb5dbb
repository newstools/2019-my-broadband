Telkom has launched the “best data deal in South Africa”, its FreeMe 20GB Big Deal. The Telkom Big Deal for April 2019 includes the following: Telkom stated that users have the option of selecting a month-to-month SIM-only package, or take the deal as a contract and add a device. To see how Telkom’s Big Deal compares against competing products on the market, we looked at what Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C have on offer. To qualify for the comparison, the package must be SIM-only, and contain anytime data and all-network minutes. The table below details what we found, clearly showing that the FreeMe special offers excellent value for money. Combined with the fact that it is a month-to-month offer, which removes potential fears about “contract cancellation” issues, and that Telkom roams on Vodacom’s network, and many may be interested in this month’s Big Deal.
