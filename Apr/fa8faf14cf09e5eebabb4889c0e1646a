Shopify and uAfrica will host the 2019 Connect eCommerce Summit in Johannesburg on 16 July 2019 and in Cape Town on 18 July 2019. South Africa’s eCommerce market is still in its infancy compared to countries like China and the US, but with 31.18 million active Internet users it holds great potential. To help local entrepreneurs take advantage of the eCommerce opportunities in the country, Shopify and uAfrica joined forces to bring their Connect events to South Africa. The 2019 Connect eCommerce Summit will give delegates the knowledge and skills to establish, grow, and improve an online store. uAfrica marketing coordinator Danika Uhlmann said it provides a platform where experienced online merchants and newcomers can connect, network, and learn from each other. She added that the event not only focuses on general eCommerce topics, but also delves deeper into the everyday problems faced by online businesses in South Africa. “Success stories and personal experiences will be shared, along with hints, tips, and tricks from seasoned eCommerce veterans,” she said. Speakers at the event include uAfrica MD and Bidorbuy founder Andy Higgins, serial entrepreneur Warrick Kernes, and Shopify’s head of international growth.
