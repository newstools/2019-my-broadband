The recently-released Nokia 9 PureView smartphone has a major security flaw in its fingerprint authentication technology. Users have reported that the fingerprint scanner on the Nokia 9 PureView sometimes unlocks the device when it reads an unregistered fingerprint. A video also shows the device being unlocked by simply placing a pack of chewing gum on the on-screen fingerprint sensor. Users on Reddit have also reported the same issue, stating that the smartphone can often be unlocked with any fingerprint or even other objects. HMD Global chief product officer Juho Sarvikas announced on Twitter that the company is rolling out an update which is meant to address this problem, although many users are still reporting that the issue persists. The software update which aims to improve fingerprint authentication on the Nokia 9 PureView is currently rolling out to markets worldwide.
