Songuo Motors, a South Korean automotive brand, has announced its intention to distribute its upcoming NeuWai range of electric vehicles in South Africa. The NeuWai range will include two-seater and four-seater ultra-compact vehicles, a modular vehicle, an SUV, a one-ton truck, motorcycles, and scooters. The range was announced at the 2019 Seoul Motor Show on 28 March, and Songuo Motors has already signed contracts to distribute the vehicles in 30 countries across 5 continents. “We are honoured to have so many innovative business leaders already committed to distribute NeuWai vehicles,” said Tim Shin, CEO of Songuo Motors. The goal of the NeuWai range is to give customers fantastic value for money, the company said, and it plans on doing this by forgoing the traditional assembly plant model. Songuo Motors said that instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on traditional assembly plants, it will be using its own NeuWai Semi-Knock Down Kit assembly plants, which are only expected to cost between three and ten million dollars each. Additionally, NeuWai vehicles will use proprietary Songuo composite body panels, which are molded in colour and offer a glossy finish. This will negate the need to paint body parts at the assembly plant. Production of the NeuWai range is expected to begin in 2020.
