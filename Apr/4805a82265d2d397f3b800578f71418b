iFixit has published its teardown of Apple’s new iPad Mini 5, revealing a jumble of components found in various other iPads. Within the tablet’s chassis is Apple’s A12 Bionic processor paired with 3GB of LPDDR4X RAM. The iPad Mini 5 sports the same capacity battery as the previous-generation tablet and looks like a smaller iPad Air, but boasts the camera system of an iPad Pro – making it a unique combination of iPad hardware and designs. An 8MP primary camera and 7MP FaceTime HD camera are placed on the rear and front of the iPad Mini 5 respectively, and the device’s LCD display has a resolution of 2,048 x 1,536. After disassembling the device, iFixit gave the new iPad Mini a repairability score of 2 out of 10, citing the widespread use of adhesive and the difficulty in replacing the battery and home button as major obstacles in repairing the tablet.
