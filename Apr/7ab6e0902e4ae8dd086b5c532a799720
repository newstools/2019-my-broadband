TP-Link has launched a new whole-home mesh Wi-Fi system called the Deco M4. The “dual-band whole home mesh Wi-Fi system” consists of three mesh units that provide Wi-Fi coverage throughout a home, said the company. It is positioned as an affordable solution when compared to competing products and will retail in the US for $179 (around R2,500). At the time of writing, local pricing was not available. “It is one of our most exciting and budget-friendly mesh Wi-Fi systems to date,” said TP-Link. The system provides a coverage area of 5,500 square feet – 510 square metres – and can connect up to 100 devices over Wi-Fi. It also provides seamless roaming, which means that devices stay connected to a single network SSID as you move around your home and connect to different mesh nodes. “Finally, Deco M4 is incredibly easy to set up and manage. Users can quickly get started using TP-Link’s Deco app for iOS or Android,” said the company. “The app offers a location feature that can help you find the best place to put Deco nodes throughout your home, optimising coverage.” TP-Link said its Deco M4 system features the following specifications: TP-Link added that the Deco M4 is also compatible with existing Deco systems, including the Deco M9 Plus and the Deco M5.
