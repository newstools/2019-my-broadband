Samsung could be developing a new smartphone with a wraparound display, according to a new patent filing. According to the patent information, the smartphone will feature a bezel-less front display which wraps around the top of the device and continues over the edge onto the back of the smartphone. This means the single wraparound display on the smartphone could function as both a front and rear display, aiding in standard photography and allowing users to take selfies with the primary camera system. According to the patent, the device described would sport “a display configured to include a first surface in a first direction, a second surface in a second direction opposite to the first direction, and a third surface enclosing at least a portion of the space formed between the first surface and the second surface”. Drawings provided with the patent filing show that a central feature of the device will be its ability to improve photography by allowing the subject to see themselves before the photo is taken. Below are the images supplied with the patent filing for Samsung’s wraparound smartphone display. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304636" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-wraparound-display-1.jpg" alt="Samsung wraparound display 1" width="640" height="939" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-wraparound-display-1.jpg 713w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-wraparound-display-1-273x400.jpg 273w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-wraparound-display-1-293x430.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-304638" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-wraparound-display-2.jpg" alt="Samsung wraparound display 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-wraparound-display-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-wraparound-display-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-wraparound-display-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
