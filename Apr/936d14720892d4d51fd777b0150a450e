LG has filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office detailing a transparent foldable smartphone. The device described in the patent comprises a “foldable plate” and a foldable double-sided display which can deliver varying levels of transparency. Like Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, the device folds out like a book, although it sports a full-screen display which is transparent instead of a smaller discrete display on the front of the smartphone. The level of transparency can also change depending on how the device is held. For example, if it is placed flat on a surface the display is almost opaque. However, when it is raised higher to eye level, the screen becomes more transparent. The patent also describes a single-lens camera at the front of the device and a triple-lens system on the back which includes a laser sensor to aid in depth sensing. While the patent is relatively detailed, there is no guarantee that the device described will make it to market in the near future, or at all.
