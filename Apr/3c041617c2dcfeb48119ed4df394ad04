Both Huawei and Samsung have recently launched mid-range smartphones, targeting users who seek premium features without forking out tens of thousands of rands. The Huawei P30 lite is Huawei’s mid-range smartphone within its new P30 range, and offers an impressive number of premium features despite its low price tag. Samsung’s A30 and A50 smartphones are set to compete with the P30 lite in a similar price range, as all three smartphones are situated within a R4,499 – R6,999 price range. The P30 lite is already available to South African customers, while the Galaxy A30 and A50 smartphones are set to release this month. But which of these three smartphones offers the best value for money? Here is how these smartphones fare across a variety of metrics that are important to smartphone users. The Galaxy A30 offers a dual-lens camera system, consisting of a 16MP primary lens and a 5MP ultra-wide lens. The A50, in contrast, uses a superior triple-lens system, which consists of a 25MP primary lens, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth-sensing camera. Huawei’s P30 lite camera system operates at a similar level to that of the A50, offering a triple-lens camera system – including a 24MP primary camera, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 2MP tertiary lens. The P30 lite’s front camera beats both Galaxy competitors substantially, offering a powerful 32MP lens. In contrast, the A30 and A50 offer front cameras with 16MP and 25MP lenses respectively. All three of these competing smartphones offer their users 4GB RAM. Both the P30 lite and the Galaxy A50 also provide users with 128GB internal storage, whereas the A30 only offers users 64GB. While the trio of smartphones all utilise octa-core processors, the A30 again lags behind its competition. The P30 lite’s Kirin 710 processor offers frequencies of 2.2GHz and 1.7GHz – virtually identical to the 2.3GHz and 1.7GHz offer by the processor of the Galaxy A50. In contrast, the A30’s processor only offers CPU frequencies of 1.8GHz and 1.6GHz. HD displays are on offer for each of these smartphones. The two brands use different technologies. The P30 lite uses IPS LCD technology for its 6.15-inch display, while the Galaxy devices both offer 6.4-inch AMOLED displays instead. All three displays use bezel-less designs as well as a droplet-style notch for their front cameras. The materials used to build the P30 lite outclass those of the Galaxy A30 and A50. The A-series smartphones are made from plastics, which can easily get scratched and don’t offer a premium feel. In contrast, the P30 lite uses a glass back, which makes the phone feel like a premium device, and reduces the risk of it scratching. The backs of these three smartphones can be viewed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302878" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-lite-back.png" alt="Huawei P30 lite back" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-lite-back.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-lite-back-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-lite-back-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302880" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-A-series-backs.png" alt="Samsung A series backs" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-A-series-backs.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-A-series-backs-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-A-series-backs-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Pricing is a significant consideration in the mid-range smartphone market, with customers trying to get the best phone for the best price. The A30 is the cheapest of the three smartphones, with a recommended retail price of R4,499. This is understandable, since it is an overall inferior device when compared to both the P30 lite and the Galaxy A50. While offering similar specifications to the A50, the P30 lite is substantially more affordable. The A50 has a recommended retail price of R6,999, the P30 lite costs just R5,999. Additionally, the Huawei P30 lite also wins out when comparing contracts available on South Africa’s leading mobile networks. This is shown in the table below. Ultimately when comparing these phones, the Huawei P30 lite comes out on top. For a similar price to the A30, the Huawei device offers superior specifications – and for similar features, the P30 lite is available at a substantially lower price. This is yet another example of how Huawei offers customers fantastic value for money – offering superior features with a more affordable price tag.
