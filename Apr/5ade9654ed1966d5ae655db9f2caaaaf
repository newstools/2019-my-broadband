As smartphones become increasingly expensive and your ageing handset continues to perform its duties admirably, you might wonder why you should fork out money for a new device. Well, there have been a number of new features released on high-end and even mid-range devices which greatly improve the experience of using your smartphone. From the widespread adoption of bezel-less OLED display to the steadily increasing performance of mobile chipsets, there are many reasons to upgrade. This year is an especially good time to switch to a new device, thanks to the technological leaps made by major manufacturers and the availability of high-end features on mid-range devices. Flagship Android devices have seen a price hike compared to their previous-generation counterparts, but this comes with an array of new features. Samsung’s Galaxy S9 featured a similar design and specifications compared to the Galaxy S8, but the manufacturer has made a major leap forward with the design and hardware of its Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10 boasts a triple-camera system, bezel-less Infinity O display, in-screen fingerprint sensor, cutting-edge processor, and massive storage space. Huawei followed suit shortly after, releasing its P30 and P30 Pro – which boast exciting new features and unprecedented camera hardware. Artificial intelligence features are also being baked into high-end devices, with the inclusion of dedicated neural processing units (NPUs) on chipsets to facilitate machine learning-powered experiences. A great example of this is the Huawei P30’s Master AI photography feature, which can automatically recognise the subject of your shot and adjust settings accordingly – even while not connected to the Internet. The biggest indication of a revival in smartphone innovation however, was the announcement of foldable devices from Samsung and Huawei. These tablet-smartphone hybrids are set to release this year and if you are looking to upgrade to a cutting-edge device no matter the cost, they offer the widest array of new features. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297364" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-vs-Galaxy-Fold.jpg" alt="Mate X vs Galaxy Fold" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-vs-Galaxy-Fold.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-vs-Galaxy-Fold-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mate-X-vs-Galaxy-Fold-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If you are understandably unwilling to spend more than R10,000 on a smartphone however, there have been great advancements made in the mid-range sector. Samsung and Apple both released “budget” versions of their flagships, which retain many high-end features but offer a lower price tag. Perhaps the best example of a great-value device, though, is Huawei’s new P30 Lite – which is priced at R5,499. The smartphone is considerably more affordable than the flagship P30 and P30 Pro, but includes a triple-lens camera system, bezel-less display design, and a 32MP selfie camera. Due its great value offering, the Lite models of the P Series smartphones have performed exceptionally well in the South African market and the P30 Lite is expected to be no exception. Mid-range devices from other manufacturers such as Xiaomi and Nokia are also inheriting flagship features and bringing them to the reasonably-priced segment for the first time. Whether you are planning to buy the latest flagship or an affordable, good-value device, 2019 looks like a good year to do it.
