Whether you’re planning on starting up a website or are looking to move to a new host, there are many South African hosting providers to choose from. It is crucial that you pick the right hosting service if you want to ensure that you get reliable performance and sufficient hosting resources for your website. There are lots of considerations one should make when comparing hosting providers – such as cost, storage space, and even customer service. Failing to do this could see your website suffer under significant stress, or just due to system-based issues. It is a good idea for companies to consider the various options at their disposal before deciding on a hosting package. This was recently proven by a conflict between Brand SA and Avatar, where the former claimed that it had been paying nearly R100,000 per month for hosting that was worth R2,500. The lion’s share of this cost was attributed to “additional data” and “excess web traffic” fees, costing Brand SA over R75,000 per month. International domain and hosting giant GoDaddy recently launched in South Africa, aiming to engage with small business owners and entrepreneurs in South Africa. “As small businesses fuel the South African economy, our official launch here signals our commitment to supporting this vibrant entrepreneurial landscape,” said Stefano Maruzzi, GoDaddy VP for the EMEA region. GoDaddy has also released its South African prices, while it is simultaneously running a launch special of R10 for a year’s ownership of a .co.za or .com domain. The international company enters a market already packed with hosting companies, but its packages seemingly offer great value for those wishing to access Linux shared web hosting with a high storage capacity. The prices of hosting from South Africa’s leading hosting companies is below. *It must be noted that GoDaddy packages offer an initial discounted price, but packages renew at normal pricing once the first subscription term has elapsed.
