Cell C has launched its overhauled MediaPlay subscription packages, offering customers data packages with bundled minutes, SMSs, and access to the mobile operator’s Black streaming service. Each new MediaPlay package includes promotional data for exclusive use on the Black platform as well as access to a number of Black channels. “MediaPlay has been specifically designed to allow customers to enjoy streaming their favourite TV stations and binge on the latest movies, series, and music videos without worrying about the costs of data,” Cell C said. “Completely integrated telco and entertainment means that customers will only need to worry about a single cost-controlled bill at the end of the month.” MediaPlay now consists of eight different packages which offer various amounts of data, bundled minutes, and levels of access to the Black platform. “With ultra-fast 4G coverage, now more widely available across all of South Africa, it is the best time to take advantage of what MediaPlay has to offer,” said Cell C CCO Junaid Munshi. Each MediaPlay package has different out-of-bundle (OOB) rates, although it must be noted that users can opt-out of OOB usage through the mobile operator’s Spend Control function.
