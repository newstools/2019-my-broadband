Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, the last supported operating system based on Windows XP, stopped being supported as of Monday. TechRepublic reports that although Windows XP stopped being supported five years ago, the use of POSReady 2009 allowed users to receive security updates through the use of a registry hack. While Microsoft recommended that users shouldn’t implement this registry hack – saying that it does not “fully protect Windows XP customers” – it made no attempt to prevent the hack’s use. POSReady 2009 is designed specifically for point-of-sale (POS) devices, offering a smaller performance footprint and specific functionality for POS terminals. If one counts POSReady, this brings over 17 years of Windows XP support to an end – making it the longest-running version of Windows ever. Other versions of Windows XP have also been discontinued in recent months, such as Windows Embedded Standard 2009, which lost support on 8 January 2019. Users have until July to implement the last POSReady 2009 patches.
