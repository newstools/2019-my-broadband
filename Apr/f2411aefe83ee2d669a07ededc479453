Sony is set to launch a 102 megapixel full-frame camera sensor, according to leaks from EOSHD. Code-named IMX555CQR, the sensor is expected to roll out to Sonyâ€™s consumer cameras and will reportedly be available to other camera manufacturers. Canon has previously been rumoured to have a 100MP full-frame sensor in development, but it now appears that Sony has taken the lead in the race to be the first to launch such a sensor. The 35mm Sony sensor would be able to capture still images in up to a 12,288 x 8,192 resolution, while it will also offer users the ability to record 6K videos. Images taken in such a large resolution would require large storage devices, but with the recent launch of 1TB SD cards from Western Digital and Micron, storage will not be an issue.
