Cape Town is drilling boreholes and wells at a rapid rate to ensure it has a stable water supply. According to a report in the Sunday Times, over 26,000 registered boreholes and wells have been created. This is compared to 1,500 in 2016. The continued focus on drilling for water comes just over a year after Cape Town faced severe droughts and water shortages. This led the city t0 implement strict water restrictions on citizens, which saw residents not flushing their toilets and showering while standing in buckets to reuse the water. The report stated that the Western Cape public works department has secured the water supply to 57 of its 90 key facilities by using boreholes – and that Cape Town plans to add 300 million litres a day of supply in the next 10 years. This will be achieved, in part, by using groundwater extraction, desalination, and treated wastewater. Good news for residents, though, is that dam levels in the area are much higher than they were a year ago. Cape Town’s dams are at 50% as of the start of April, compared to just over 20% a year ago, stated the report.
