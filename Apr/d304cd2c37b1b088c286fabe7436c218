Google is no longer selling its Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones through its online store, with the listings for the devices removed from the platform. The smartphones section of the Google Store no longer lists the devices and attempting to navigate to the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL pages redirects users to the listing for the Pixel 3. Google previously offered discounts on its second-generation Pixel smartphones after the launch of the Pixel 3 line-up, which launched in October last year. Customers can still purchase the devices from third-party retailers while stock remains available, however. Google Pixel devices are not distributed to South African suppliers directly, meaning that local users will have to purchase imported devices if they wish to buy one of Googleâ€™s smartphones.
