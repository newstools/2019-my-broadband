A detailed teardown of the Samsung Galaxy Fold by iFixit has been pulled from the website after Samsung requested that it be taken down. According to iFixit, they received their Galaxy Fold device from a “trusted partner” rather than directly from Samsung. Samsung requested through this partner that iFixit take down its Galaxy Fold teardown content. “We are under no obligation to remove our analysis, legal or otherwise. But out of respect for this partner, whom we consider an ally in making devices more repairable, we are choosing to withdraw our story until we can purchase a Galaxy Fold at retail,” said iFixit. iFixit maintains that the findings in its teardown – “that the device provided insufficient protection from debris damaging the screen” – are valid. The Galaxy Fold had its proposed launch date delayed after numerous pre-release versions sent out to reviewers suffered from display-related issues. When it does officially launch, it will cost South Africans around R45,000 to get their hands on Samsung’s first folding smartphone.
