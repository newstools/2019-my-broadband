Eskom has announced that there is a high risk of Stage 1 rotational load-shedding from 17:00 to 22:00 today. The national energy provider said in a statement that the possibility of load-shedding is due to “a shortage of capacity due to the loss of generating units at our power stations.” Eskom added that load-shedding will only take place if it is absolutely necessary. “We continue to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity smartly and sparingly during this period to beat the winter peak,” Eskom said. “By rallying together we can contribute to a saving of up to 500MW, which is the equivalent of 1 unit at a power station.” The power utility has asked South Africans to switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and appliances. In a statement on Monday, Eskom Group Chief Executive Phakamani Hadebe said the power utility hoped that load-shedding would be almost non-existent throughout the winter period. “We have done an extensive winter plan and review of our power system and identified the problems,” he said. “While the plan gives us confidence that we may go through winter with no or limited load-shedding, we are mindful of the potential of risks on a very tight power system which may result in shifts on the power system and which could result in load-shedding.”
