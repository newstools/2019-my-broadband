Sony has recently announced its new Xperia L3 smartphone, which is a powerful new entry-level smartphone to add to its entertainment-focused range. “Xperia L3 further improves on giving our customers what they want with all-day entertainment. Xperia L3’s 18:9 display coupled with a long-lasting battery that will easily see you through the day means our users can do more of what they love,” said Tatsuya Tsuzuki, product planner at Sony Mobile. The fantastic value-for-money nature of the Xperia L3 also makes it the perfect Mother’s Day gift. Its crisp, large display is perfect for catching up on series, while a powerful camera ensures that family memories are captured with great efficiency. Here are the fantastic features that one gets when purchasing the Xperia L3. As Tsuzuki mentioned, the Xperia L3 offers a sleek 18:9 display ratio, which gives users substantial screen space while simultaneously being of a size that is comfortable to hold. The display is a 5.7-inch HD+ screen that provides detailed viewing, meaning that the user gets the best possible experience. It is also durable and long-lasting thanks to being made with Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which helps the device withstand an accidental drop. The Xperia L3 sports a glossy, attractive finish which has resulted in a smartphone that looks and feels like a more expensive device, even though it is very affordable. Despite being an entry-level smartphone, the Xperia L3 offers users a dual camera set-up using 13MP and 2MP lenses. This system will let you capture crisp and creative photos, and even allows you to use Bokeh effect to blur out the background behind your subject. The Xperia L3 also sports a powerful 8MP front camera which will let you capture fantastic selfies, while also offering technologies that enable features such as selfie mode, skin brightness, face sharpening, and Bokeh effect. Included as part of the front camera is a display flash, allowing you can take great selfies even in low-light conditions. The smartphone sports a massive 3,300mAh battery powered by the MediaTek Helio P22 chipset. This is particularly valuable for mothers who are constantly on the move and need a fully charged phone. Whether they’re picking up their children from school, buying groceries for the week, or grinding at work – the Xperia L3 will cruise through even the busiest of days. It also uses Sony’s own Xperia Adaptive Charging, which monitors power consumption as your battery charges, and ensures that your battery isn’t overworked. This means that your battery is less likely to lose capacity over time due to over-exertion. The Xperia L3 is also compatible with USB Power Delivery charging, which means that you can charge your phone for mere minutes and get hours of use out of it. The Sony Xperia L3 has launched on Android 8.0 Oreo and is available in both Single SIM and Dual SIM versions. Best of all, its recommended retail price is only R4,499 – making it the perfect gift for your wife or mother this Mother’s Day. Made for Xperia accessories are also available in mobile stores nationwide.
