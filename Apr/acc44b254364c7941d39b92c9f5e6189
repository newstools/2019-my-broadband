Huawei has announced that its first quarter revenue increased by 39% year-on-year – proof that the company is continuing to grow as it expands into new markets. According to The Verge, Huawei has also shipped 59 million phones over the past quarter, and earned $26.8 billion in revenue. This success is despite the United States warning that Huawei’s network equipment is possibly positioned to be utilised by China to spy on countries that use it. Due to these concerns, the US has been pressuring countries across the world not to use Huawei’s 5G infrastructure, but despite this, Huawei has announced that it has distributed over 70,000 5G base stations across the world. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it has aided China in spying on other countries, and claims that it would never do so. However, the US counters this by suggesting that the company may ultimately not have a choice in the matter. Due to the US position on Huawei smartphones, none of its mobile carriers sell the Chinese company’s devices.
