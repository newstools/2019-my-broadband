Absa successfully migrated the banking platform used by six of its African subsidiaries from the Barclays data centre in the United Kingdom to Absa’s data centre in South Africa. These six subsidiaries are Botswana, Ghana, Mauritius, Tanzania, Seychelles, and Zambia. This migration, said Absa, took place between 12-14 April and entailed moving customer transaction-processing capability and data from IT systems owned and housed by Barclays to systems owned by Absa in South Africa. “The successful completion of the project, which was large and complex and one of our key Platinum projects, is another significant milestone in Absa’s separation from Barclays, due for completion in June 2020,” said Paul O’Flaherty, Chief Executive for engineering services. Absa said the migration unlocks a number of benefits for its African clients, including an upgrade of the banks’ hardware infrastructure, additional flexibility and scalability, and the reduction of a number of risks.
