Uber Eats has officially launched in Bloemfontein, with locals now able to order food from a variety of popular restaurants in the area. Uber has partnered with restaurants including Haru Sushi, Bubble Tea, Eatalia, Dalmala’s, KFC, and Steers to cater to a wide range of customers in Bloemfontein. “Coming into the city of Bloemfontein was always a part of the plan in expanding the convenience that comes with Uber Eats, for both eaters and restaurants,” said Uber South Africa general manager Ailyssa Pretorius. “We look forward to building a strong footing here, and adding more restaurants onto the app, providing more choice and helping local restaurants connect with more customers.” Pretorius added that the company was excited about bringing new earning opportunities to hundreds of locals in the city. “Whether you’re doing delivery for a little bit of extra cash or saving up for something big, being your own boss and working on your own schedule is something that we know really matters to partners.” Uber Eats customers in Bloemfontein can download the app on their Android or iOS device to get started, and they can use the promotional code “HELLOBLOEM” to receive unlimited free deliveries for a fixed time period. This promotion is redeemable for new users only and is valid until 10 May 2019.
