Mark Cerny, Sony’s lead system architect for the next-generation PlayStation, has revealed what gamers can expect from the upcoming console in an interview with Wired. Cerny did not confirm whether the console will follow tradition and be named the “PlayStation 5”, but he did hint that it is not just another upgrade to the existing generation. He added that the next-generation console would not be available any time this year, although a number of development studios are already working with the hardware. Cerny stated that the PlayStation would include an octa-core third-generation Ryzen CPU built on AMD’s 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture, in addition to a Radeon Navi GPU which will support ray-tracing. Other features will reportedly include support for 8K gaming, backwards compatibility with PS4 games, and unspecified new functionality related to cloud-based gaming.
