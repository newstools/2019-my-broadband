Update – Cell C has confirmed to MyBroadband that its Waterfall Campus is still closed after a strike action yesterday and early this morning. Cell C’s head office in Waterfall, Johannesburg was closed down due to a strike action yesterday and this morning. Multiple reports on social media state that Cell C’s head office has been on lockdown since Wednesday, when staff were reportedly striking at the premises. Other users reported that staff access to the premises had been denied today due to mass employee suspensions, with employees resorting to working outside the building. The office itself has reportedly been host to a heavy police and security presence, with access to the building still being restricted. According to images posted online, a written warning was sent out to striking staff on Wednesday afternoon stating that if they continue to engage in a strike action and do not return to work they would be suspended pending a disciplinary hearing. In this notice, Cell C warned workers that they risked being dismissed for misconduct after this suspension. There is currently no information available regarding the reason for this latest strike action. Workers at Cell C previously engaged in a strike outside the company’s head office in February 2019, protesting the lack of bonuses paid to staff for work-related performance in 2017. Cell C confirmed to MyBroadband that employees who embarked on an illegal strike at the its Waterfall Campus yesterday have been suspended pending a disciplinary hearing. “This follows two ultimatums that were issued yesterday by management requesting staff to desist from illegally blocking the company’s entrances and exits and return to work,” the company stated. “Striking employees failed to comply with both ultimatums leaving Cell C with no choice but to suspend them.” Cell C’s head office remains closed to the public as striking workers remain around the campus.
