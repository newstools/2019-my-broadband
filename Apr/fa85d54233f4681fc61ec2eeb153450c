Google’s upcoming mid-range Pixel smartphone has been leaked on the company’s website, confirming previous reports of cheaper Pixel smartphones launching this year. As spotted by users on Reddit, Google’s online store briefly listed a new “Pixel 3a” smartphone underneath its Phones menu – along with multiple accessories for the device. Leaked information shows that the Pixel 3a could feature a similar design to the flagship models, although they are expected to include mid-range Snapdragon chips and scaled-back camera systems. Rumours point to two new mid-range Pixel devices – the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL – which may feature similar specifications, but differently-sized displays. The links to the Pixel 3a did not lead anywhere while they were up, meaning there are not any official images of the new device available.
