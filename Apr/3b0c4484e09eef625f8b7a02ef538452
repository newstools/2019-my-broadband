Sony is making a splash in the mid-range smartphone market by offering its high-value Xperia 10 range of devices. Sony Mobile’s Xperia 10 range offers innovative and premium features at an incredibly competitive price. The Xperia 10 range consists of two smartphones – the Xperia 10 and the Xperia 10 Plus. Both smartphones provide users with a high-quality full HD display, which uses a unique 21:9 aspect ratio to optimise the users’ video and media consumption experience. The Xperia 10’s display is sized at six inches, while the Xperia 10 sports a 6.5-inch display – both of which are optimally designed for video consumption thanks in large part to the 21:9 aspect ratio. Despite their large size, these Xperia 10 smartphones feel light and slim, and sit comfortably in the user’s hand. This aspect ratio also means that users will find it significantly easier to view two apps side-by-side, as this display is optimal for such a configuration. The benefits of side-by-side app functionality are numerous, such as the ability to watch videos while texting, or reading a document while summarising its contents in an email draft. To run two apps side-by-side, when on the home screen, long press the app icon that you want to split and  select both apps you’d like to display in the 21:9 multi-window. The Xperia 10 range’s displays are also protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which ensures toughness and durability, while the display is encapsulated by a stylish metallic finish to further the credentials of the Xperia 10 range as a premium-looking smartphone. The Xperia 10 and 10 Plus’ cameras both offer 4k video recording in a 21:9 ratio – which is the same ratio that film-makers record in. However, there are also other options available for recording – such as 1:1 recording for the sake of posting to Instagram. Both the Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus offer powerful dual camera set-ups. The Xperia 10’s lenses provide 13MP and 5MP photography, whereas the Xperia 10 Plus offers 12MP and 8MP lenses. Both cameras can use the artistic Bokeh effect, which allows the subject to stand out from its background. The Xperia 10 Plus even offers 2x optical zoom, ensuring that you can get closer to the action without sacrificing image quality. The Xperia 10 range features powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets – Snapdragon 630 and 636 for the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus respectively – which ensures that all your tasks take place smoothly and seamlessly. Additionally, both smartphones offer powerful batteries – 2,870mAh and 3,000mAh for the 10 and 10 Plus respectively – ensuring that your battery doesn’t drain before day’s end. Additionally, Sony’s Smart Stamina technology predicts how long your power will last and adapts your energy usage to keep you going for longer. Both smartphones offer 64GB onboard, and while the Xperia 10 offers 3GB RAM, the 10 Plus goes a step further and provides 4GB RAM to its owners. The Xperia 10 range includes advanced audio technology thanks to Sony’s powerful high-resolution audio, which uses LDAC technology to offer pure music consumption – even when listening wirelessly. Sony’s Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE HX) upscales compressed sound files to the highest-possible quality, which means that you can still get access to subtleties of original recordings and live performances. Pick up the Xperia 10 for just R6,499, or the Xperia 10 Plus for R8,999. Both recommended retail prices position the Xperia 10 range as powerful player in the super mid-range market. Photos of the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus are below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304334" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Xperia-10-1-640x430.png" alt=""
