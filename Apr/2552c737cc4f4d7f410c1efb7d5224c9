Dell has refreshed some of its popular gaming laptops with newer technology, bringing them back in line with gamers’ expectations, Engadget reports. The Alienware M15 and M17 laptops have already begun shipping with Nvidia’s recently-launched 1660 Ti and 1650 GPUs. From June, these laptops will also ship featuring 9th-generation Intel CPUs and RTX graphics units – making them an attractive option for gamers looking for a more powerful device. Dell has also launched new mid-range G5 and G7 gaming laptops which also feature the 1660 Ti and 1650 GPUs – replacing their former GTX 1050 Ti and 1060 GPUs. The company also plans to launch a new XPS 15 2019 business laptop in June that will provide good gaming performance thanks to its GTX 1650 GPU. Pricing for these upgraded laptops has yet to be revealed.
