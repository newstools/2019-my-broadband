The SA Post Office released a special stamp on 26 April to commemorate 25 years of democracy in South Africa. The stamp was designed by the Post Office’s graphic designer, Rachel Ackermann, who used a combination of watercolours and digital artwork. It features a man holding the South African flag, looking out over the ocean to a symbolic future for all. The stamp costs R31.80 – the rate for a registered letter – and is available at all major post offices or from sa.stamps@postoffice.co.za. “The stamp effectively puts a seal on the key democratic rights that the Post Office has delivered to South Africans over the past 25 years,” said Post Office CEO Mark Barnes.
