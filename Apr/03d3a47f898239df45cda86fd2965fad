Vodacom has announced its intention to review the provisional data price report published by the Competition Commission. The mobile operator said that it will meet the 14 June deadline for making further submissions and comments on both the recommendations and findings in the provisional report. “Vodacom will also use this round of consultations to provide accurate data, which does not seem to have been built into the provisional report,” the company said. The company said that the data used by the report was out of date, as it was based on data prices from 2016 and 2017, which affected the conclusions drawn from it. “The information used is outdated and doesn’t take into account hourly, daily, weekly and fortnightly bundles, which is 80% of our volume sales in pre-paid offerings,” said Vodacom. According to Vodacom, it desperately needs spectrum to continue reducing its data prices. “Lengthy delays in completing the digital migration and allocating 4G spectrum has curbed the pace at which data prices could have fallen.” The company said that other countries used in the report have already licensed 4G spectrum licensed, which impacts its ability to deliver lower data prices.
