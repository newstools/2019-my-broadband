HMD Global has announced that its Nokia 9 PureView smartphone is available in South Africa. The device was unveiled in February 2019 andÂ has now launched locally in partnership with Vodacom. The smartphone is the first in the world to have a 5-camera system on the rear, all of which are 12MP sensors with Zeiss optics. Three of the camera sensors are monochrome and two are colour sensors, with the device co-processing information from all the lenses to create a single image. Other standout features of the phone include a body made from 6000 Series aluminium, an IP67 rating, Gorilla Glass housing a 5.99-inch QHD+ OLED display, and 6GB of RAM. The Nokia 9 PureView is available for purchase exclusively from Vodacom and its retail partners for R11,849. It is also available on contract.
