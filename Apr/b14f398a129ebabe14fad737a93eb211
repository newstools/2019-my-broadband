Official renders of the upcoming foldable Motorola Razr were leaked online through Weibo and have now been posted to SlashLeaks. The leaked images confirm that the device will sport a notched folding screen design, as previously revealed in a patent filed by the smartphone company. The new Motorola Razr will fold vertically, functioning as a flip phone with a foldable OLED display, and it will be bundled with a dedicated wireless charger in addition to a range of other accessories. It is unclear from the leaked renders whether there is a second display on the outer chassis of the smartphone. Previous reports stated that the foldable Motorola Razr would launch later this year, and would be priced at $1,500 once it is released. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304606" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-Razr-foldable-1-640x339.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr foldable 1" width="640" height="339" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-Razr-foldable-1-640x339.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-Razr-foldable-1-600x318.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-Razr-foldable-1.jpg 727w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304608" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-Razr-foldable-2-640x351.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr foldable 2" width="640" height="351" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-Razr-foldable-2-640x351.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-Razr-foldable-2-600x329.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Motorola-Razr-foldable-2.jpg 727w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
