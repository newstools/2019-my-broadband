Vodacomâ€™s annual reports reveal that its CEO Shameel Joosub paid over R41 million in tax over the last two years. Every year, there are numerous reports on the high salaries of banking, telecommunications, and IT executives of JSE listed companies. These executives typically earn tens of millions of rands per year, which always cause criticism and even elicit calls to cap the remuneration of these executives. What is seldom reported however, is that most of these executives pay a large portion of their salary to the taxman. This money directly contributes to social welfare grants, building schools and hospitals, and improving the lives of people in under-privileged communities. The table below shows how much tax Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub paid in 2017 and 2018. This debunks speculation that executives do not pay their fair share of tax by employing inventive accountants.
