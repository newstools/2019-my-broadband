MTN recently launched its ultra-cheap Smart S handset in South Africa, which is priced at only R249. Despite its feature phone-like price tag, the Smart S runs the KaiOS operating system which supports a number of applications, including Facebook, Google Maps, and most importantly WhatsApp. WhatsApp support is one of the most important features in a low-cost device, as it opens up a world of cheaper communication over a mobile data connection and allows you to connect to friends and family more easily. Whether you are looking for a cheap device with support for just the basic smartphone app suite or a backup smartphone which you could rely on for a few days, WhatsApp support is a crucial feature to have. The good news is that budget smartphones are becoming increasingly advanced as their flagship counterparts continue to evolve and high-end features trickle down to the mid-range before eventually filtering down to the low-end of the market. This means that there are quite a few cheap smartphones which still support crucial functionality such as WhatsApp and other social media apps. We have listed some of the the cheapest smartphones you can buy in South Africa which support WhatsApp below. Prepaid pricing from Takealot and official operator channels was used in the comparison. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298516" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G.jpg" alt="MTN Smart S 3G" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MTN-Smart-S-3G-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269145" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ASTRO-GOLD.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ASTRO-GOLD.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ASTRO-GOLD-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ASTRO-GOLD-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302312" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/STK-Storm-2-E-Pluz.jpg" alt="STK Storm 2 E Pluz" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/STK-Storm-2-E-Pluz.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/STK-Storm-2-E-Pluz-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/STK-Storm-2-E-Pluz-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302314" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Z2.jpg" alt="Samsung Z2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Z2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Z2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Z2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302316" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Invens-A2.jpg" alt="Invens A2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Invens-A2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Invens-A2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Invens-A2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
