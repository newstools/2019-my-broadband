Sony is beginning to clamp down on sexually-explicit content in PlayStation 4 games across the world, the company confirmed to The Wall Street Journal. Independent of industry standards and ratings, Sony has developed new in-house standards which limit sexual content in games on its platform. The company said this move would help developers “offer well-balanced content” which “doesn’t inhibit the sound growth and development” of younger gamers. Developers have reportedly been forced to cover up nudity using effects such as smoke and light rays, and this has already been noticed in major titles such as Devil May Cry 5. This move stands in stark contrast with the approach of platforms like Steam, which allows sexually-explicit content on its online store in addition to adult-only PC games.
