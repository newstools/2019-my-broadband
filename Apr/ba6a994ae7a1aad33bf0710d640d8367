We at Techtraders have seen a diverse audience of users for Cougar gaming gear. Initially, we were surprised to find board rooms kitted out in Cougar chairs, whole design teams using our mice. Client support using our headsets and so on. Through discussions with the procurement teams, we realised that the quality vs price of the gear meant that often businesses were buying superior products that are designed for the comfort of the user. This translated into happy teams and friendlier spending budgets. <img class="size-large wp-image-301500 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chairs-640x268.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="268" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chairs.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chairs-600x251.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> A variety of teams have acquired the chairs from designers to coders, from word crunchers to number crunchers.
