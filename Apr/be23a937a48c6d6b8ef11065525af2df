Acer has unveiled its newest top-end gaming laptop, the Predator Helios 700. The gaming laptop sports a 17-inch full HD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, 3ms response time, and support for Nvidia G-Sync. This is paired with GeForce RTX graphics in the form of either an RTX 2070 or RTX 2080 GPU. The laptop also packs a new Intel Core i9 processor, which Intel said it will reveal soon – adding that it will be even more powerful than what is on the market today. Other hardware specifications include up to 1TB of SSD storage, Wi-Fi 6, and up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM. A standout feature of the Helios 700 is its sliding keyboard which maximises airflow into the chassis. The HyperDrift keyboard can be slid down from its standard position to expose two AeroBladeTM 3D Fans, five copper heat pipes, and a vapor chamber. “By simply sliding the keyboard forward, two additional air intakes are uncovered above the keyboard and below the display, giving the powerful heat-generating components extra air flow for maximum cooling and unleashed overclocking,” said Acer. A glass panel is also fitted in this section, which provides a view of the laptop’s heat pipes. The keyboard itself is a full RGB unit with MagForce WASD keys. The MagForce Keys use linear switches that “trigger actuation immediately upon the initial press, and increase up to 100% to give players more control over precise movements in the game”, said Acer. Acer said five speakers and a subwoofer have been added to the new laptop, too, providing high-end sound for gamers. The Acer Predator Helios 700 will go on sale in the US from July 2019, starting at $2,699 – with prices varying based on specifications. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-302654 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-1-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-1-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-1.jpg 1128w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-302656 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-3-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-3-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-3-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-3-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/700-3.jpg 1128w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-302660 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7800-2-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7800-2-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7800-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7800-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7800-2-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7800-2.jpg 1128w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-302662 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Helios-4-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Helios-4-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Helios-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Helios-4-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Helios-4-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Helios-4.jpg 1128w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  Kevin Lancaster is reporting from New York as a guest of Acer South Africa.
