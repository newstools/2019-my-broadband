FNB has launched new functionality in its mobile banking app which allows users to shop from within the banking application. Clients can now browse the eBucks Shop from the banking app – which FNB said is a first in South Africa. Customers can also make purchases from the eBucks Shop in the app using FNB Pay, allowing them to pre-load debit and cheque cards for payment. FNB said customers can expect to get up to 40% off on exclusive deals available in the eBucks Shop and the mobile app also allows them to track their purchases and view their order history. “We are very excited about offering this service to customers, because it adds to the helpful capabilities available on the FNB app,” said eBucks Rewards CEO Johan Moolman. “Under the eBucks Rewards tab, customers are able to see how they can earn more eBucks to achieve their objectives, view their complimentary Slow Lounge visits, as well as register on the Entertainer app for free.” He added that in the near future, customers can expect more features to come to the eBucks tab in the FNB app.
