German website WindowsUnited has uncovered information that hints towards the new, Chromium-based version of Microsoft Edge coming to macOS. The website was running Windows Server 2016 when it received a notification that said the new Edge was not supported, adding that the software only supports Windows 10 version 1709 and higher, and macOS 10.12 and higher. If the screenshot provided by the website is to be believed, this would imply that macOS will soon receive its own version of Microsoftâ€™s new Edge browser. Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president at Windows, has previously said that Microsoft plans on launching the new Edge on macOS devices, although he did not provide a timeline. The move to make Edge available on other operating systems is in stark contrast with its strategy for the old version of the browser, which was exclusively available on Windows 10. Preview builds of the new Edge for Windows are available to download.
