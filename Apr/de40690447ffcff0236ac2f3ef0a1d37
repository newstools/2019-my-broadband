Many mobile subscribers in South Africa are complaining about disappearing airtime, and the reason may be that you are subscribed to a content service without knowing it. Rogue wireless application service providers (WASPs) secretly subscribe thousands of cellular users to their content subscription services every month. This is possible because the mobile operators supply WASPs with the ability to bill subscribers’ accounts for services, which often happens without the consent of the subscriber. By default, South African SIM cards are open to WASP billing and it is up to subscribers to check their cellphone account to see if they are the victim of rogue WASPs. Audit manager Cameron Modisane recently fell victim to a rogue WASP and shared his experience on social media. Modisane said he discovered that he was signed up for a “content service” which he knew nothing about and did not subscribe to. “I discovered this when I was checking the invoice that they sent me. They were charging me about R100 a month,” said Modisane. He showed his Cell C bill, which included the R107.01 content subscription which he said he did not consent to. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303508" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-Bill-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="646" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-Bill-1.jpg 891w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-Bill-1-396x400.jpg 396w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-Bill-1-768x776.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-Bill-1-426x430.jpg 426w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Modisane’s experience highlighted the importance of regularly checking your cellphone bill to ensure you are not unknowingly subscribed to a content service.
