SARS IT head Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane has been offered a 4-month salary package to resign, but she is adamant on keeping her job. This is according to a report by News24, which quoted sources close to Makhekhe-Mokhuane. Makhekhe-Mokhuane has been at home on discretionary leave for the past five months, following her controversial interview on SABC Morning Live. In the interview, she responded to the interviewer with the phrase: “Mam, can you give me protection from yourself.” The SARS IT head’s comments throughout the interview were deflective and combative, resulting in an awkward dialogue which has been mocked heavily since its airing. SARS has not issued an official statement regarding Makhekhe-Mokhuane’s suspension, however, and said its HR matters were private. Prior to her suspension, Makhekhe-Mokhuane earned R3.067 million for 11 months of work – a figure which has been criticised following the disastrous TV interview. Based on this, a 4-month salary package for her to resign would come to just over R1.09 million. SARS previously stated that Makhekhe-Mokhuane is an experienced IT professional with IT diplomas and an MBA from the University of the North West. The SARS IT head has also testified before the Nugent Commission, which highlighted major concerns at the IT branch of the revenue service. “In the 15 months of her tenure only one strategy meeting has been held. Of the 11 meetings with her subordinates she attended only four,” stated the Nugent Commission. He added that the aggressive, indecorous, and unusual manner in which Makhekhe-Mokhuane gave evidence was not appropriate for a person in her position at SARS. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
