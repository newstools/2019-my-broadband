Samsung’s foldable smartphone has been shipped to reviewers around the world, but many devices have already encountered problems. Android Police reported on the “disastrous display issues” experienced by the device, noting that many reviewers around the world are experiencing problems with the smartphone’s display. Reviewers have reported that their $1,980 Galaxy Fold has already broken, with the display breaking and flickering for unknown reasons. CNBC tech editor Steve Kovach uploaded a video of his broken device to Twitter, showing how the Fold’s display broke after just one day of normal use. Some users – such as YouTuber Marques Brownlee – tried to peel off what looks like a screen protector on the Galaxy Fold’s display only to find that trying to peel off this layer completely breaks the display. Other users have reported their device displays flickering and turning off after only a few days, even when this protective film was left undisturbed on the device. Samsung said it is investigating the issues with the Galaxy Fold, and it has advised reviewers not to remove the protective film on the display.
