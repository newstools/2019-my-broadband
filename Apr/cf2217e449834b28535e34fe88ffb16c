Once launched, iPhone and iPad users will be able to activate the system-wide dark mode in Settings, including a high-contrast version. iOS 13 will also support the ability for iPad apps to open multiple windows simultaneously, each of which can be moved around freely and anchored to various sections of the screen. Other improvements in the upcoming update include the addition of an undo gesture, smarter mail features, a new volume HUD, and improved multiple item selection. The new version of the operating system is expected to be announced at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, which starts on 3 June 2019.
