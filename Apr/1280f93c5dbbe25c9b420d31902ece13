Huawei recently launched its new P30 Series smartphone lineup in South Africa, which includes the new mid-range P30 Lite. Like its predecessor – the P20 Lite – the P30 Lite aims to dominate the mid-range smartphone sector in South Africa by offering a great value proposition unmatched by competitors. At first glance, Huawei’s P30 Lite seems to offer all the attractions of a flagship device with an even more attractive price tag. The device makes various compromises to deliver on its price point target, but it still looks like a modern flagship smartphone and has some powerful features. However, how does it compare to the older P20 Lite now that the previous-generation device has received a price cut in South Africa? We compared the specifications, pricing, and features of the two devices to determine which is the better buy. The Huawei P30 Lite is a big improvement over the older P20 Lite in terms of hardware, and includes the latest-generation HiSilicon Kirin 710 chipset. With 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, the P30 Lite exceeds the storage specifications of the older device while also offering a better CPU and a bigger, higher-resolution display. Another major improvement is the long-overdue implementation of a USB Type-C port on the P30 Lite, showing that Huawei is ready to adapt to superior emerging technology standards on its mid-range devices. The single 32MP selfie camera is unprecedented for a smartphone in this price range, and the P30 Lite’s triple rear camera system offers superior image quality and resolution compared to the older device. Below are the full specifications for the P30 Lite and P20 Lite smartphones. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302208" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-Lite-vs-P20-Lite.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 Lite vs P20 Lite" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-Lite-vs-P20-Lite.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-Lite-vs-P20-Lite-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-P30-Lite-vs-P20-Lite-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The most striking difference between the two smartphones is their display design, with the Huawei P30 Lite boasting a flagship-like bezel-less display layout while the P20 Lite has a thicker bottom bezel. Huawei placed the fingerprint sensor to the back of the P30 Lite to offer more screen space, and the newer device also sports a smaller, less intrusive notch than its predecessor. On the software side, the P30 Lite offers much greater value thanks to the inclusion of an Android 9.0-based operating system. Additionally, the P30 Lite boasts a more powerful HiSilicon Kirin 710 chipset with support for GPU Turbo. This allows for far greater performance in mobile games as well as accelerated video processing. The Huawei P30 Lite is available in South Africa at a recommended retail price of only R5,999 – which makes it an attractive purchase compared to other mid-range smartphones. The older P20 Lite has been discounted to R4,499, which also offers great value. However, the additional features, design overhaul, and improved hardware of the new P30 Lite is well worth the extra cost. Huawei expects its P30 Lite to be just popular as the P20 Lite was in South Africa last year, when it became the best-selling smartphone in its pricing sector.
