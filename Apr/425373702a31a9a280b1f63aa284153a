Netflix will begin testing a new feature which displays the top 10 TV shows and movies on its platform. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the streaming service would begin testing the new feature in the United Kingdom later this year. “Later in Q2 we’ll be running a test to improve our UK member experience by releasing weekly top 10 lists of the most popular content on our UK service across various programming categories,” Hastings said. “For those who want to watch what others are watching, this may make choosing titles even easier.” He added that after a few months of this feature being available, Netflix would decide whether to expand the top 10 list to other countries or remove it entireley.
