The Galaxy A30 features 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internal storage, while the Galaxy A50 also has 4GB of RAM with 128GB of internal storage. Samsung’s new Galaxy A Series smartphones sport the company’s Infinity-U display design, which comprises of a bezel-less panel with a cutout at the top of the screen for a single camera.
