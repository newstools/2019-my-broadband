Eskom has launched a premium service called Eskom Prime, which protects South African households and businesses against load-shedding. The new Eskom Prime subscription plan is priced at R995 per month for residential subscribers, and between R2,495 and R9,500 per month for businesses – depending on their electricity demands. After signing up, Eskom Prime subscribers are placed on a new electricity grid which is run by Eskom directly instead of municipalities. This power grid is exempt from load-shedding, ensuring members always have electricity to their homes and businesses. The Prime grid will also receive preference when restoring power after incidents such as cable theft, with strict service level agreements in place. Subscribers will also get access to automated billing, and a VIP call centre and online support to resolve any electricity supply problems. Speaking exclusively to MyBroadband, Eskom shared a promotional brochure with its Eskom Prime pricing and benefits – shown below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-300898" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Brochure-4.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="905" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Brochure-4.jpg 2480w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Brochure-4-283x400.jpg 283w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Brochure-4-768x1086.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Brochure-4-304x430.jpg 304w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Brochure-4-1200x1697.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Eskom Prime CEO Moranang Isiwula told MyBroadband they are upbeat about the prospects of the Prime service, which they expect to raise in excess of R1 billion per month for the struggling utility. This additional income, Isiwula said, will be enough to cover Eskom’s financial shortfall and help to cover its debt commitments. Isiwula also defended the Eskom Prime service and its pricing against potential naysayers, stating it is significantly more cost-effective than other load-shedding solutions like diesel generators or battery backups. “Most households spend more than R1,000 per month on generators, diesel, or battery solutions to run only a few lights and appliances during load-shedding,” Isiwula said. “With Eskom Prime you get an uninterrupted electricity supply for your home during load-shedding, which is the best value-for-money solution available to South African households.” A video detailing the Eskom Prime service is posted below. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
