More than 200,000 customers have placed a deposit to pre-order Tesla’s Cybertruck. The electric bakkie was unveiled at an event on 22 November, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk showing off its ability to withstand impacts from hammers, ball bearings, and bullets. It boasts impressive specs, such as a 0-100 km/h acceleration in 2.9 seconds and the ability to tow a 6-tonne load. The Cybertruck will be available in three electric motor variants – single ($39,900), dual ($49,900) and triple ($69,900). The first edition will offer 250 miles (400km) of range, while the top-of-the-line version will be able to drive up to 500 (800km) miles on a single charge. Musk revealed that the company had received 146,000 orders for the electric pick-up in a tweet on Saturday. Of these orders, 17% opted for the single motor, 42% for the dual-motor, and 41% for the triple-motor edition. Earlier today, Musk sent out a tweet with the line “200K”, suggesting that the number of deposits had now grown to 200,000. This initial popularity is impressive considering that the first Cybertrucks will only be put into commercial production in late 2021, with the high-end editions only scheduled for manufacturing in 2022. In addition to the news, Musk also tweeted a video of the Cybertruck in a tug-of-war with a Ford F-150 pickup truck.
