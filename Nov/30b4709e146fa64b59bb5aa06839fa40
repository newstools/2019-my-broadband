Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has warned customers that they must install a critical firmware patch or risk their SSDs permanently failing after 32,768 hours of operation. This means that after 3 years, 270 days, and 8 hours of operation, these storage devices will fail completely – posing a massive issue for enterprises who rely on these devices. “After the SSD failure occurs, neither the SSD nor the data can be recovered,” said HPE. If several of these SSDs were installed at the same time, it is likely that they will all stop working almost simultaneously – creating further problems for those who haven’t installed this firmware patch. Users who have backups of their data on different drives will be able to access this data, but will not be able to access anything on the HPE SSD itself. Some of the affected SSDs are found in HPE server and storage products, including HPE Synergy, HPE ProLiant, and HPE Apollo. Others, however, are standalone storage devices. The full list of model numbers for affected devices is as follows:
