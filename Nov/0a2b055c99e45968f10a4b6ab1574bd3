Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company will reveal its electric pickup truck at a Los Angeles event on 21 November. Tesla originally announced that it would add a bakkie to its line-up in 2017. Musk has dubbed the vehicle the “Cybertruck” and teased some details about it at Tesla’s annual shareholders’ meeting in June. At that event, he said that Tesla considered the Ford F-150 as a benchmark for its own vehicle. “If the F-150 can do it, then a Tesla truck should be able to do it,” Musk said. Ford is currently working on an electric version of the F-150, with reports of a possible debut in 2021. Few other details about Tesla’s pickup have been revealed, but Musk has stated that the “cyberpunk” bakkie will look “like it came out of a sci-fi movie”, calling it “the coolest car” he’s ever seen. Musk also pointed out that the date of the unveiling coincides with the period during which the cult classic cyberpunk film Blade Runner is set. According to Musk, the Cybertruck will cost less than $50,000 at launch, allowing it to compete with petrol and diesel-driven pickups from Ford, GMC and Chevrolet.
