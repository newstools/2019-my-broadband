South African retailers are gearing up for Black Friday 2019, which is set to kick off on Friday 29 November. Black Friday is a tradition which South Africa adopted from the United States. It takes place the day after Thanksgiving and signals the start of the holiday shopping season. Black Friday is the biggest online shopping day in South Africa, and many local retailers are expected to reach record sales this year. It has become so popular in South Africa that many online retailers have invested in additional resources to ensure their websites can handle the load on the day. It is, however, not only online stores which are making the most of the Black Friday craze – brick-and-mortar stores like Checkers and Pick n Pay are getting ready for big sales. Last year, South African consumers spent a record R2.9 billion, and this is expected to grow by 30% this year. This growth is putting tremendous pressure on payment platforms, which have failed spectacularly in the past. On Black Friday in 2018, for example, many major payment platforms in South Africa buckled under the transaction volumes and went offline. This downtime cost many online retailers large amounts in lost sales, especially if they did not have alternative digital payment methods available. The good news is that most online retailers are better prepared this year, with multiple credit card and instant EFT payment options. Here is a list of stores which will offer special deals on Black Friday 2019. Takealot said its first deals will be available from 00:01 on Black Friday (29 November), with a number of products on sale across a range of categories. These deals will continue into the weekend and into Cyber Monday. Takealot said its sale will culminate on Takealot Tuesday on 3 December. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307228"
