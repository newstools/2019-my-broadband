Open source operating system Bliss OS will now let users run Android 10 on any Linux, Windows, or Chromebook PC or tablet. Bliss OS announced the launch of the Bliss OS 12.0 Alpha program on the XDA-Developer forum. “Our focus is to bring the Open Source community a quality OS that can run on all your devices as a daily driver, syncing your apps, settings, and customizations across all platforms you run Bliss on,” said Bliss OS. “Bliss OS comes with a wide selection of customization options from around the Android community as well as unique options developed by our team. With so many options available, you’ll find it hard not to enjoy the Blissful experience.” The developers have cautioned that the current iteration of the operating system is not meant for general use, but rather for testing and experimentation purposes. “These are to be considered ‘in development’ and are in no way intended for general use. We will expect any bug reports or issues to be accompanied by a log of some sort,” said Bliss OS. Bliss OS also used a unique method to allow users to sign up to this test. “We added a secret download button to the website for our Bliss OS 12 alpha builds, and the secret code to reveal it is hidden within this first post [on XDA-Developers].” Once users find the secret code, they can visit Bliss OS’s GitHub page, navigate to “just below the Downloads section,” and enter their secret code.
