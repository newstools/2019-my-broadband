Eskom issued a statement on 4 November, warning South Africans that the national electricity grid is severely constrained due to the unexpected loss of power generation units. “The electricity system is severely constrained today and will remain so until at least Thursday,” Eskom said. “This is as a result of the unexpected loss of some generation units over the weekend.” Eskom stated that load-shedding was not expected, but it may be implemented at short notice in the event of additional units being unexpectedly lost. “The system remains vulnerable to a number of variables due to historic factors such as inadequate maintenance, as well as ageing of plant,” the power utility said. “The unexpected loss of additional units may result in load-shedding at short notice,” it added. Eskom added that due to these unplanned breakdowns, Eskom has been forced to rely extensively on emergency resources – diesel and water – to meet electricity demand. The power utility asked residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly as it restores the stability of the power generations system, adding that it would continue to keep South Africans updated on the status of the national power grid.
