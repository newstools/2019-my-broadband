Spotify has launched its Spotify Premium holiday offer, which aims to bring former subscribers back to the music streaming service. These former subscribers can sign up for three months of Spotify Premium for once-off price of R59.99. This is usually the price for a single month of Spotify Premium, which essentially makes the deal a “buy 1 month, get 2 months free” offer. “Whether you’re cuddled up by the fire, headed home for the holidays or hosting family and friends, Spotify Premium has you covered with 50 million tracks available on-demand and ad-free, and 500,000 podcast titles,” Spotify said. Spotify’s Premium service gives subscribers access to features and improvements not available in the free version of the music streaming platform. These include the removal of all adverts, the ability to download songs onto your device, and an unlimited number of skips. This deal begins today and runs until 31 December 2019. Users who ended their Premium subscription after 19 October 2019 are not eligible for the deal. Spotify also said that anyone who wants to become a Premium user for the first time can sign up to their always-on deal for new subscribers. This deal lets these users receive their first three months of access to Spotify Premium for free.
