Adobe Photoshop for iPad is now officially available for users running iPadOS 13. This means it can be used on the following devices: The software is available on a free 30-day trial, and can also be acquired as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. Photoshop for iPad does not offer all of the features the desktop version has, but Adobe has plans to add new functionality in the future. “We’re just getting started. For future versions, we’re looking at enhancing our tools used for brushes, masks, refining edges, and selecting smart subjects,” Adobe said. “Plus, we want to make it easier to access your brushes and fonts in Creative Cloud.” Users of Photoshop for iPad will be able to use PSDs, which will be available across all your devices that use Photoshop via Adobe’s cloud service. Photoshop for iPad will allow users to create masks and composite images, use brush tools, and retouch images using spot healing and clone stamps. Photoshop for iPad supports both 1st- and 2nd-generation Apple Pencil styluses. Adobe has also released a help series which teaches users how to use all the features of its new iPad-compatible software.
