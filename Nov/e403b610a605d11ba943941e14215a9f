Facebook has unveiled an updated design for its corporate logo. The Facebook app will retain its current logo, with the new design being used for the company’s website and general branding. “Over the coming weeks, we will start using the new brand within our products and marketing materials, including a new company website,” Facebook said in a blog post yesterday. Facebook wants people to be able to distinguish easily between the company, its other products, and the Facebook app. “The new branding was designed for clarity, and uses custom typography and capitalization to create visual distinction between the company and app,” Facebook said. “This brand change is a way to better communicate our ownership structure to the people and businesses who use our services to connect, share, build community and grow their audiences.” The new style is also intended to make it easier to identify Facebook’s other products, including Whatsapp, Instagram, Messenger, and Oculus with the “From Facebook” annotation. The gif and images below show what the logo will look like in a varying range of colours, as well as how the new logo will appear in upcoming versions of Instagram and WhatsApp. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326283 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Facebook_Wordmark_Cycling-1.gif" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-326285 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IG-Product-Screen-640x360.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IG-Product-Screen-640x360.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IG-Product-Screen-600x338.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IG-Product-Screen-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IG-Product-Screen-1200x675.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-326287 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-Product-Screen-640x360.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-Product-Screen-640x360.jpeg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-Product-Screen-600x338.jpeg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-Product-Screen-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WhatsApp-Product-Screen-1200x675.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
