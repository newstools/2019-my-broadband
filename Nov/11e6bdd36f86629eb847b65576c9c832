Apple has unveiled its new 16-inch MacBook Pro laptop, which boasts a bigger and better display than previous generations as well as a boost in performance. The new device is powered by an Intel octa-core processor with up to 64GB of RAM, and it includes a new keyboard design along with a 16-inch Retina Display. Apple said the new Magic Keyboard with its redesigned scissor mechanism and 1mm travel delivers the best typing experience ever in a Mac notebook. The 16-inch MacBook Pro also includes a six-speaker sound system, longer battery life, Touch Bar, Touch ID, a Force Touch trackpad and Apple’s T2 Security Chip. “Our pro customers tell us they want their next MacBook Pro to have a larger display, blazing-fast performance, the biggest battery possible, the best notebook keyboard ever, awesome speakers and massive amounts of storage, and the 16-inch MacBook Pro delivers all of that and more,” said Apple senior director of Mac and iPad Product Marketing Tom Boger. “With its brilliant 16-inch Retina display, 8-core processors, next-gen pro graphics, even better thermal design, new Magic Keyboard, six-speaker sound system, 100Wh battery, up to 8TB of storage and 64GB of fast memory, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the world’s best pro notebook.” The highlight of the new MacBook Pro is its 16-inch Retina display, which boasts a resolution of 3,072 x 1,920 and a pixel density of 226ppi. Apple said that this is the biggest Retina display ever implemented on one of its notebooks. “Each display is individually calibrated in the factory for accurate gamma, white point and primary colours,” Apple said. The device also includes the power necessary to drive this display, thanks to its inclusion of AMD Radeon Pro 5000M graphics. “Paired with GDDR6 video memory and with an 8GB VRAM option for the first time, pro users will be able to tackle GPU-intensive tasks faster than ever,” Apple said. Customers who choose the standard configuration for the new Macbook Pro 16-inch will see 2.1-times faster graphics performance than the previous generation. It also includes the largest battery ever included in a Mac notebook, offering up to 11 hours of wireless web browsing or Apple TV video playback. The new MacBook Pro 16-inch is available in the United States in two configurations, priced from $2,399 and $2,799 respectively. These configurations can be changed to include more memory, upgraded graphics, and an improved CPU. Specifications for both Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch configurations are listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-327509" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-640x416.jpg" alt="Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-640x416.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-600x390.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-768x499.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-1200x779.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-327507" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Powerful-Processors-Faster-Memory-Unity_111319-640x416.jpg" alt="Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Powerful-Processors-Faster-Memory-Unity_111319" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Powerful-Processors-Faster-Memory-Unity_111319-640x416.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Powerful-Processors-Faster-Memory-Unity_111319-600x390.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Powerful-Processors-Faster-Memory-Unity_111319-768x499.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Powerful-Processors-Faster-Memory-Unity_111319-1200x779.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-327503" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-640x367.jpg" alt="Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319" width="640" height="367" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-640x367.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-600x344.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-768x441.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-1200x689.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319.jpg 1286w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-327517" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-2.jpg" alt="Macbook Pro 2" width="640" height="478" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-2.jpg 1286w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-2-536x400.jpg 536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-2-768x573.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-2-576x430.jpg 576w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-2-1200x896.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-327515" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1.jpg" alt="Macbook Pro 1" width="640" height="448" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1.jpg 1286w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1-572x400.jpg 572w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1-768x537.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1-614x430.jpg 614w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1-1200x840.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
