Huawei officially unveiled the MatePad Pro, a powerful tablet to succeed its MediaPad series. The reveal follows a previous leak of the device’s design, which mirrored Apple’s recently-unveiled iPad Pro. The MatePad Pro’s 10.8-inch display has ultra-thin bezels, measuring at 4.9mm, which is slimmer than those on the iPad Pro. The tablet uses an 8MP punch-hole for its 8MP front camera, while the rear camera features a 13MP lens. The tablet comes with Huawei’s premium Kirin 990 chip, which is paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage in the entry-level model, or 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage in the higher-end “metallic edition”. The base model costs 3,299 yuan (R6,930) and the metallic edition is priced at 4,999 yuan (R10,500). The metallic edition includes a stylus and keyboard. In terms of battery size, the MatePad Pro offers a 7,250 mAh pack, which supports 40W wired fast charging and 15W wireless charging. The tablet will be available in four colours –  orange, grey, white, and blue-green. The MatePad Pro is already available for pre-order in China, where it will be available from 12 December. No launch date or pricing for other markets have been revealed. It should be noted that just like Huawei’s Mate 30 devices, the MatePad Pro does not currently offer support for Google services and apps.
