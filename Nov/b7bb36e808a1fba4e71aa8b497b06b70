AMD has launched its third-generation Ryzen 9 Threadripper CPU line-up, which comprises three new processors – the Ryzen 9 3950X, 3960X, and 3970X. “3rd-Gen Ryzen Threadripper processors combine leadership performance and energy efficiency to create the ultimate high-end desktop solution,” said Saied Moshkelani, senior vice president and general manager, AMD Client Compute. “We are extremely excited to expand our leadership high-end desktop processor family and deliver the world’s fastest processors.” The 3rd-gen Threadripper lineup features two new processors which are built on a 7nm Zen 2 architecture and offer up to 88 PCIe 4.0 lanes with a 144MB cache. AMD claims that the better of these two processors, the 32-core 3970X, offers up to 90% faster performance when compared to “the competition’s top-end HEDT processor”. According to AMD, this means that the 3970X is the fastest processor in the high-end desktop market. AMD also announced the release of its Ryzen 9 3950X processor, which was originally unveiled in September. The company had delayed the release of this chip due to high demand, with AMD wanting to ensure that there was enough stock of the product at launch. AMD claims that the Ryzen 9 3950X is the fastest 16-core consumer desktop processor in the world, offering a 22% performance increase compared to previous generations. “With our 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors, AMD is once again raising the performance bar significantly for creators, developers, and PC enthusiasts,” said Moshkelani. These processors will be available worldwide from 25 November 2019. Pricing is as follows: The specifications for the new AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors are below.
