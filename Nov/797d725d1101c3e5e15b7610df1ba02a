MyBroadband has released its October 2019 customer satisfaction ratings, which shows that Supersonic and Cybersmart are the best Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in South Africa. The customer satisfaction ratings further revealed that MTN and Vodacom are the top mobile operators in the country. These ratings are based on feedback from thousands of users who conducted speed tests through MyBroadband’s web-based, Android, and iOS speed test apps between 1-31 October 2019. After users performed a speed test, they rated their ISP based on their overall satisfaction with their provider. These customer satisfaction ratings were then used to rank South Africa’s ISPs and mobile operators, with an equal weight given to the mobile app and web-based results. [Test your speed now: MyBroadband Speed Test | Speedtest.co.za] The table below ranks South Africa’s prominent ISPs based on the average ratings received through MyBroadband’s web-based speed test and mobile app. While the results are in line with previous rankings, the gap between the leaders (Supersonic and Cybersmart) and the chasing pack (Vox and Cool Ideas) grew. Telkom continues to sit at the bottom of the rankings, which means that the company will have to improve its service levels to hold on to subscribers. A surprise in this month’s results is that Rain continues to slip down the rankings and is now ranked second to last. This may be related to deteriorating network performance. MTN and Vodacom topped the mobile operator rankings. These ratings are in line with their network performance, which shows that customer satisfaction and network performance are closely linked. Cell C has the lowest average customer satisfaction, which is once again in line with their network quality.
