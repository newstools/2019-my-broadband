Shoprite has announced that it will hold a big Black Friday sale this year at Shoprite and Checkers stores. “Africa’s largest retailer is gearing up for its 6th Black Friday sales bonanza on 29 November, when both Shoprite and Checkers customers will be able to stock up for the fast-approaching holiday period with massive discounts on various grocery and household essentials,” said Shoprite. It stated that extensive planning starts at least six months in advance to ensure customers get the best Black Friday experience. “As with previous years, we will again stay true to what Black Friday is all about – deep-cut specials that offer real value. We have been hard at work to secure the best deals and to ensure all our stores are sufficiently stocked,” said Willie Peters, General Manager: Marketing at Shoprite and Checkers. “We look forward to making this year’s Black Friday our biggest yet.” Shoprite also stated that members of the new Xtra Savings rewards programme will be the first to receive notifications of the Black Friday deals on offer at Checkers. “Shoppers still have time to join Xtra Savings ahead of this year’s Black Friday and can do so free of charge. Xtra Savings members also stand a chance to win their Black Friday shopping for free,” said the company. In 2018, Shoprite, Checkers, and Checkers Hyper stores served 125 customers per second on Black Friday.
