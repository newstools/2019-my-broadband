Several Facebook users have reported that their iPhone cameras were inadvertently opening in the background of the mobile app. The issue appeared to be affecting devices running Facebook’s app on iOS 13. In one instance, a user discovered that the Facebook Stories camera UI would briefly open behind a video while switching from portrait to landscape mode. Then, after switching back to portrait, the app would open directly into the Facebook Stories camera. Today, while watching a video on @facebook, I rotated to landscape and could see the Facebook/Instagram Story UI for a split second. When rotating back to portrait, the Story camera/UI opened entirely. A little worrying… pic.twitter.com/7lVHHGedGf — Neo QA (@neo_qa) November 2, 2019  Web designer Joshua Maddux also posted a video on Twitter showing how the camera interface could be seen running in the background when slightly dragging down a photo. He tested and confirmed the issue on five different iPhones running iOS 13.2.2. Devices with iOS 12 did not seem to be affected. Facebook told The Verge that the issue was being caused by a bug in an app update from 8 November. The company said it found no proof of videos or photos that were uploaded due to the issue. A fix for the bug was submitted to Apple yesterday.
