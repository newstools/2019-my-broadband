Wireless earbuds have become incredibly popular due to their portability and great audio quality. While Apple’s AirPods were the first wireless earbuds to gain mass acclaim and traction, many great alternatives have since emerged. One of these options is the Huawei FreeBuds Lite, which deliver great performance at an affordable price. I recently acquired a pair of the Huawei FreeBuds Lite and were pleasantly surprised with what they offered. I was pleasantly surprised that a product so affordable could produce such high-quality sound. When I listened to music through the FreeBuds Lite, they offered a full, immersive audio experience, delivering strong bass and crisp treble sounds. They were also great for making phone calls, and my voice was noted as being clearer than usual to those with whom I spoke. Their voices sounded clearer to me, too – meaning that both the built-in microphones and the audio quality were highly impressive. The FreeBuds Lite offer 12 hours of playtime with their charging case and three hours of playtime on a single charge. They also offer 90 minutes of playtime after being charged for 15 minutes. An awesome feature of these earbuds is their noise cancelling. This blocks out unnecessary background noise but still lets you hear important sudden, loud noises for your safety. You can tap the side of these buds to control them in the following ways: You don’t have to worry about these earbuds mistakenly activating any of these features while in their case, however, as the FreeBuds Lite automatically detect when they are no longer in your ears. They will also pause your music when removed. The FreeBuds Lite fit perfectly into their charging case thanks to a magnetic system which ensures that they do not move around when stored. This case is also used for pairing the Huawei FreeBuds Lite with your smartphone, and when we undertook this process we found it to be incredibly simple. While searching for devices using Bluetooth on our smartphone, we simply pressed and held the single button on the case for about two seconds to pair our FreeBuds Lite to the phone. These earbuds come in two colours – carbon black and ceramic white – both of which look great. The FreeBuds Lite have a simple, sensible design that crucially fits perfectly into one’s ears. This fit means that they are highly unlikely to fall out, even while exercising. These earbuds feel solid and strong, and left me assured that I was using a high-quality product. While they have a host of impressive features, their biggest selling point is arguably their price. The FreeBuds Lite cost just R1,669 at Takealot – an absolute bargain for what they offer. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330805" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-2-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-2-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-2-768x516.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-2-1200x806.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-2.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330803" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-Light-Headline-1-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-Light-Headline-1.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-Light-Headline-1-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBuds-Light-Headline-1-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330811" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FreeBUD-640x430.jpg" alt="FreeBUD" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FreeBUD-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FreeBUD-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FreeBUD-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FreeBUD-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FreeBUD-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FreeBUD.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330823" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBudss-2-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBudss-2-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBudss-2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBudss-2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBudss-2-768x516.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBudss-2-1200x806.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-FreeBudss-2.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
