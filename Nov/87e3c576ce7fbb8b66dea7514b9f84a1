Fossil has revealed its latest hybrid smartwatch, which features physical watch hands and a circular always-on display. While Fossil’s previous hybrid watch, the Fossil Q Activist, could only show which apps were issuing notifications by using the watch’s hands, the new Fossil Hybrid HR sports an e-ink screen that can display information such as weather, app notifications, and activity tracking. The monochromatic screen helps to increase the life of the 55mAh battery, with Fossil stating the devices will offer up to two weeks of use on a single charge. As part of its activity tracking suite, the Hybrid HR boasts heart rate monitoring, a step counter, and a distance tracker, among other features. The Hybrid HR does not come with a built-in GPS, however. When synced with a supported Android or iOS smartphone, wearers will also be able to control music playback, view incoming phone calls and messages, and find their device with a ringing function. This interface will run on Fossil’s proprietary operating system, which supports syncing with Google Fit. Users will be able to select from a range of designs with interchangeable straps. The Hybrid HR is available in the US and other countries starting from $195 (R2,900). Fossil has not revealed details about a local launch date or pricing.
