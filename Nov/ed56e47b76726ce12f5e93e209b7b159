Huawei has opened its Huawei Menlyn Service Store, its first flagship store in Menlyn Park, Pretoria. The store stocks the entire range of new Huawei products and offers comprehensive service to South African Huawei device owners. Huawei said the store is the first of its kind in South Africa, combining a retail offering with all the features of a service centre to provide Huawei customers with the best experience possible. Speaking at the launch of the flagship store, Huawei CBG vice president Likun Zhao said that Huawei would continue to build more retail stores and service centres across the country. “We will continue to build more stores in South Africa to ensure that our consumers have access to Huawei,” Zhao said. “For technical fans or app developers, you can also learn more from our technical experts or again build the Huawei global ecosystem together in the Huawei Community.” Zhao said that Huawei currently has five retail stores in South Africa, and in 2020, the company will continue to expand pop-up service and retail stores in the key malls of South Africa. The Huawei Menlyn Store offers a number of key features, including a one-hour repair service as well as a phone loan service to allow customers to continue using a device while their smartphone is in for repair. The store will also include a number of campaigns, including the Huawei free service day, free screen guard, its R199 battery repair offer, and its R699 screen and battery repair offer. Huawei also offers a free VIP service for select mobile phones and smartwatches with free collection and pick up. The company also provided MyBroadband with a look at their repair centre in the new Menlyn Store, where Huawei conducts repairs on customer devices. Huawei aims to complete repairs within one hour, and it has a maximum turnaround time of one day. Photos of the new Huawei flagship store in Menlyn Mall are posted below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-330339"
