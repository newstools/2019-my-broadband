Apple will upgrade the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max smartphones to have 6GB of RAM, according to a research note viewed by MacRumors. This research note was written by Barclays analysts who recently visited manufacturers from within Apple’s supply chain. In contrast, the premium versions of the current iPhone range – the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max – sport 4GB of RAM. This is despite rumours that circulated ahead of the iPhone 11 unveiling that it would offer 6GB of RAM. According to the report, the standard iPhone 12 will still have 4GB of RAM – which is identical to the iPhone 11. The analysts also expect both the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max to have rear-facing 3D sensing as well as mmWave support – ensuring that high-performance 5G will be supported by these devices. The iPhone 12 range is expected to be launched in September. The analysts also said that a modern version of the iPhone SE is set to begin production in February and be unveiled in March. The device will be significantly more affordable than the iPhone Pro range, and will reportedly look similar to the iPhone 8. It is expected to have a 4.7-inch display and a home button – much like the iPhone 8 – but will sport the latest A13 chip and 3GB of RAM.
