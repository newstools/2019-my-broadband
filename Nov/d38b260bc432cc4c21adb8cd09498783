Naspers has released its interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2019, showing impressive revenue growth for Takealot and Mr D Food. “In South Africa, Takealot solidified its position as the country’s leading B2C platform, growing GMV 51% and revenue by 25% in local currency,” Naspers said. “Similarly, its profitability improved 25% in local currency.” “One of the main drivers in this performance was marketplace, with 88% growth in GMV,” the company said. Mr D Food and Superbalist, the food delivery service and online fashion stores owned by Takealot, also showed impressive growth for the period. “Takealot’s food-delivery service, Mr D Food, recorded GMV growth of over 103%,” Naspers said. Superbalist reported good results too, with revenue growth of 28% year-on-year. Takealot has big plans for its Black Friday 2019 sale, which should result in a large spike in revenue as consumers flood the online store to take advantage of the heavy discounts. The company’s sales period will include a five-day Blue Dot Sale that begins on Black Friday (29 November) and will offer a range of new deals throughout the weekend, as well as Cyber Monday and Takealot Tuesday. During this period, Takealot will cut prices by up to 60% on thousands of items. The retailer will also launch early Black Friday deals starting from 24 November, with fresh deals added daily. Takealot expects its revenue to increase by 80% compared to Black Friday 2018. Last year, Takealot made R196 million on Black Friday, and the company hopes to reach around R353 million in revenue this year.
