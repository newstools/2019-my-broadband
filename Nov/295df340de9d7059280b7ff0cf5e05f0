SodaStream – the global leader of home carbonation systems currently sold in more than 45 countries worldwide – is pleased to announce the re-launch of its much-loved brand in South Africa (SA), one of its most promising regions. The brand’s mission is to revolutionise the beverage market by empowering people with a product that offers fun, simple and sustainable way to enjoy healthier beverages. So Sodastream benefits go beyond making sparkling water from tap water in seconds and include a brand that offers drinks that are better for you as well as better for the planet. SodaStream Marketing Director Thembakazi Ndamase unpacked the brand journey and re-positioning by divulging the triple-threat that SodaStream represents that is yet to be understood by local audiences. Through a captivating presentation, Tesh Ndamase highlighted SodaStream’s 3 key pillars: By providing an enjoyable solution towards water-drinking, consistent use of the SodaStream system can lead to many positive health benefits. These include helping to combat the dangers of sugar found in sugar-laden fizzy drinks that lead not only to weight-gain but also chronic diseases such as diabetes. SodaStream syrups comprise one third of the sugar compared to their soda equivalent while the SodaStream Zero range of syrups are sugar and preservative free. A study in the Journal of Diabetes Care suggests that people who drink two cups or less of water a day were 30 percent more likely to have high blood sugar than those who drink more daily. This is due to the hormone vasopressin which helps the body regulate hydration. When a person is dehydrated, vasopressin stimulates the liver to produce more blood sugar. Eight to 10 glasses of water a day is a tall order for many, especially if water isn’t appealing. The fun in the fizz of SodaStream’s carbonated water improves the taste of water as the bubbles bring the flavour and aroma of water to the surface. Furthermore, scientists have found an enzyme on the sour receptors of our tongues called Carbonic Anhydrase 4 (CA-IV). The bubbles stimulate the sour buds and the somatosensory system. The dual activation on the buds and the nerves creates a pleasurable sensation. This enables users to maintain hydration whilst eliminating the bland and avoiding unnecessary sugar. It’s been proven that with SodaStream consumers drink up to 43% more water. The popping of champagne corks is synonymous with having fun as the modern, cosmopolitan South African is hardwired to love bubbles. Not only does it ignite an exciting feeling amongst consumers but the SodaStream system also offers convenience and family-friendly use. With no need to purchase, carry or store large quantities of heavy and bulky bottles, the SodaStream system provides an endless supply of sparkling water, freshly made from tap water. The ability to customise one’s carbonation levels when using the system makes the machine the ideal solution for the entire family’s sparkling beverage needs. Moreover, it is economical as it will cost the family on R3.33 per liter versus other sparkling water or soda equivalents. The use of the SodaStream system also has an impact on family dynamics. A report published in 2013 indicates that sugar is more desirable than addictive drugs such as cocaine. This leads to the notion that parents are still largely oblivious to the long term, damaging effects of over-consuming sugar-dense foods and beverages. According to a report released by the World Health Organisation, “adults and children need to reduce their daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total energy intake. A further reduction to below 5% or roughly 25 grams (6 teaspoons) per day would provide additional health benefits”. The fun experience of using the SodaStream units, infusing the delicious zero sugar syrups and infusing delicious fresh fruits, makes it easier for parents to raise healthier children who ordinarily prefer sugary drinks to water. As a company that is committed to continuously improving as an earth-friendly brand and having a positive impact on the environment, SodaStream’s vision is to create a world free from single-use plastic bottles. It is estimated that 141 billion bottles and cans are not recycled every year. These levels of pollution were reflected by the showcase of SodaStream’s Cage of Shame at the launch – a cage filled with water bottles that were only used once – showcasing the extent of pollution that water bottles cause. The cage indicated global insights such as the fact that during the manufacturing process, 1 SodaStream bottle is tested to replace 512 cans and bottles in a year used by 1 person. Further to this in 2015, SodaStream users around the world saved over 4 billion plastic bottles and cans, with the number climbing every year. The SodaStream system is a promoter of pre-cycling, which is the practice of reducing waste by reducing the usage of products that generate waste. Each SodaStream reusable carbonating bottle is estimated to save the environment from 5,070 bottles and cans in 3 years, which supports the notion that SodaStream is the future, as the brand sets the standards for pre-cycling: the conscious choice to reduce plastic. By using tap water to create carbonated flavoured beverages, SodaStream makes traditional store-bought beverage bottles obsolete. This results in less plastic manufactured, less plastic waste and less transportation of bottled beverages. Along with the informative presentation which included an interactive demo to highlight how easy it is for adults and their children alike to use the SodaStream system, Liquid Chefs brought the #FizzUpYourSummer campaign to life as they showcased the tricks of how to create exciting SodaStream beverages when entertaining in one’s home or public event. The full range of products included in SodaStream’s relaunch includes the following: As guests left with a SodaStream System of their own to use, it remained evident that the renewed era of holistic wellness which benefits our bodies, improves our lifestyles and cares for our planet, is here in the form of the SodaStream revolution.
