Motorola has officially unveiled its new foldable Moto Razr smartphone. This reveal follows multiple leaks of photos and pricing of the device in recent months. Motorola describes the Razr as a “sleek, modern smartphone unlike any other”. The device features a similar form factor to its iconic predecessor, but replaces the physical T9 keypad with a foldable plastic OLED display across the length of the phone. The foldable flip display can be closed to convert the device into a pocket-sized square form. According to Motorola, the Razr’s “zero-gap” hinge will help to protect the main display as it ensures a “completely flush” fold. The Razr features a 6.2-inch 2,142 x 876 OLED foldable display, which Motorola claims will last the “average lifespan” of a smartphone. In addition, it has a 2.7-inch 600 x 800 OLED external Quick View touch display which can be used to view and respond to notifications, control music playback, and take selfies with the rear camera while the phone is closed. For performance, the Razr boasts an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 chip, paired with 6GB of RAM. In terms of the camera system, the Razr has a single 16MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. A USB-C charging port is available on the bottom of the device, with a fingerprint sensor located just above it on the front of the bottom lip of the phone. The phone will only be available in one colour – Noir Black. The Moto Razr will launch in the US and Canada in January, although no exact date has been confirmed. The device is priced at $1,499 and will be available for pre-order from 26 December.
