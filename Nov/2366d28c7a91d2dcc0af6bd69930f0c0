Smartphones are growing increasingly expensive, a fact which Huawei and Samsung both addressed by launching less expensive versions of their high-end flagships. These are not budget devices, but flagship smartphones with the same powerful chipsets and features as their more expensive counterparts. Huawei’s P30 and Samsung’s Galaxy S10e are both powerful and stylish devices, although they lack the curved screen designs and smaller chassis of the P30 Pro and S10+. They are significantly cheaper than the high-end P30 Pro and Galaxy S10 flagships, however, making them an attractive option for South African smartphone buyers. We compared the hardware, features, and pricing of the Huawei P30 and Samsung Galaxy S10e below. Both the P30 and Galaxy S10 use the latest flagship chipsets available from each manufacturer, offering high-end performance on the latest CPU architecture. The Samsung and Huawei devices both include 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, with support for high-speed LTE connections. Their camera systems are very different, however, with Huawei’s P30 offering an additional lens and a higher megapixel count compared to the Galaxy S10e. The front-facing camera on the P30 also has a significantly higher resolution than the Galaxy S10e. Both handsets have high-quality OLED displays, a physical audio jack, and use USB Type-C chargers. One of the most important differences in the specifications of these two devices is their battery size. The Galaxy S10e has a 3,100mAh battery, which is eclipsed by the P30’s impressive 3,650mAh cell. The Samsung and Huawei devices are closely matched in terms of hardware, making pricing and software the most important factors when deciding between them. In terms of software, the Huawei P30 has a clear advantage in that it runs Android 10 compared to the Galaxy S10e’s Android 9 operating system. The Huawei device also includes GPU Turbo technology, which offers greatly improved power efficiency and performance when gaming compared to other Android devices. Samsung’s Galaxy S10e has built-in security with the Knox platform, as well as the ability to pay at almost any POS terminal in the country with Samsung Pay. The price of the two devices makes it difficult not to pick the Huawei P30, however, as it is two-thirds of the price of the Galaxy S10e. Using prices from Takealot, the Huawei P30 is priced at only R10,899, while the Samsung Galaxy S10e costs R14,999. Looking at the hardware and features of the two devices along with their price tags, the Huawei P30 is definitely the most attractive choice. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-328629" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-P30-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-1-640x430.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 vs Samsung Galaxy S10e 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-P30-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-P30-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-P30-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300550" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-header.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299060" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S10e" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
