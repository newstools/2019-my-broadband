Nedbank has launched its new Money App Lite banking application for Android. Money App Lite is a streamlined and lighter version of the Nedbank Money banking app, catered to clients who use smartphones with limited data or device memory. “At Nedbank, we are committed to ensuring that our clients are integral to our digital journey and that has led us to consistently deliver market-leading client-empowering digital offerings, of which Money App Lite is the latest example,” said Nedbank Retail and Business Banking Digital Executive Stelios Vakis. Nedbank said that Money App Lite is less data-intensive and smaller to download than the original Money app, and it does not need to be updated as often. The application also has a smaller installation size, meaning it uses up less space on mobile devices with limited internal storage. Nedbank states that Money App Lite includes all essential banking features while remaining simple enough to work well on all types of smartphones. The app also uses consumes less battery compared to the full app. “For us, digital is more than an operational enabler or a transactional channel,” Vakis said. “It’s the foundation of our bank and how we deliver exceptional, efficient and value-adding experiences in response to the evolving needs and behaviours of our clients.” Nedbank Money App Lite is available to download from the Google Play Store.
