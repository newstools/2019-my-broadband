Dell believes that delays in CPU shipments by Intel may result in some companies not being able to move operating systems before Microsoft stops supporting Windows 7. According to Softpedia News, Dell believes Intel’s CPU delivery problems are unlikely to be solved any time soon. “Intel CPU shortages have worsened quarter-over-quarter and the shortages are now impacting our commercial PC and premium consumer PC Q4 forecasted shipments,” said Dell vice-chairman of products and operations. “History would suggest that if we can’t fulfil demand in the industry, then we will see it spill over into the coming calendar year, particularly with Windows 10.” Windows 7 is set to lose support from Microsoft on 14 January, but remains the second most popular operating system in the world. Intel recently apologised for its CPU shipment delays, and said that the company is trying to resolve the issue. “In response to continued strong demand, we have invested record levels of Capex increasing our 14nm wafer capacity this year while also ramping 10nm production,” said VP of Intel, Michelle Johnston Holthaus. “In addition to expanding Intel’s own manufacturing capability, we are increasing our use of foundries to enable Intel’s differentiated manufacturing to produce more Intel CPU products.” Holthaus said that this added capacity has allowed it to increase its second-half PC CPU supply “by double digits compared with the first half of this year.” “However, sustained market growth in 2019 has outpaced our efforts and exceeded third-party forecasts,” explained Holhaus. “Supply remains extremely tight in our PC business where we are operating with limited inventory buffers. This makes us less able to absorb the impact of any production variability, which we have experienced in the quarter.”
