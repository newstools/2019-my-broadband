Volkswagen is set to reveal a new vehicle from its electric ID line-up at the Los Angeles Auto Show on 19 November. Called the ID Space Vizzion, the car features VW’s Modular Electric Drive (MED) Matrix, which the company says “guarantees long ranges, dynamic driving performance, and a whole new level of digital networking”. VW calls the new vehicle a “wagon of tomorrow that combines the aerodynamic characteristics of a Gran Turismo with the spaciousness of an SUV”. The exterior of the vehicle features openings in the front and roof sections that are designed for optimal aerodynamics. The interior will sport a “completely digitized cockpit”, with parts made from sustainable raw materials, including an artificial leather called AppleSkin. VW claims that the efficient drive system and aerodynamics give the ID Space Vizzion a range of 590km. VW is investing more than €30 billion (R490 billion) in the development of its electric vehicle fleet over the next couple of years. The company started production of the ID 3 hatchback at its Zwickau plant this week. It plans to build 100,000 cars that feature the MED Matrix in 2020. Over the next 10 years, VW aims to manufacture 22 million electric cars across 70 electric models. The ID Space Vizzion will be the seventh model in the ID range, which also includes the ID Crozz, ID Buzz, ID Buggy, and ID Roomzz. The production version of the ID Space Vizzion will be available in late 2020 with different versions in North America, Europe, and China. VW has released several concept photos of the latest electric vehicle. <img class="alignnone wp-image-326915 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-2-640x394.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="394" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-2-640x394.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-2-600x370.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-2-768x473.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-2-1200x739.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-326917" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-1-640x418.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="418" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-1-640x418.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-1-600x392.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-1-768x502.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-1-1200x785.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-326913 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-3-640x338.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-3-640x338.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-3-600x316.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-3-768x405.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ID-SPACE-VIZZION-3-1200x633.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
