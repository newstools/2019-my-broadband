The South African Post Office has issued a warning about a parcel delivery scam designed to defraud clients. The SA Post Office parcel delivery scam works as follows: The SA Post Office highlighted that it does not require customers to make any bank deposit before parcels are released. “If VAT or any other fees are payable on a parcel, this is paid at the time when the parcel is delivered or collected,” the SA Post Office said. Where the Post Office has the cellphone number of the recipient, the customer will receive an SMS requesting him or her to collect the parcel at a specific Post Office branch. The SMS will not request that funds be deposited into an account. If you have information regarding this scam, please call the SA Police or the Post Office’s crime buster hotline on 0800 020 070. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-326551" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SAPO-SMS.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SAPO-SMS.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SAPO-SMS-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
