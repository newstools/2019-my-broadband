The AA has published its latest research into the automotive industry, which shows that 90% of South Africans are keeping their vehicles longer than before due to the state of the South African economy. According to the findings, over a third of respondents plan on keeping their vehicle for over ten years. The research also found that over 30% of respondents’ primary vehicles are already over ten years old, while a further 25% of the respondents’ primary vehicles are over five years old. “These results point to the increased need for better maintenance of vehicles, and for proper insurance,” said the AA. The AA said that while its research found that over 60% of respondents had car insurance, national data places this figure much lower – at about 35%. “If this is indeed the case, there is a cause for concern, as insurance is part of a good maintenance plan for any car,” said the AA. The AA’s research also found that nearly half of all owners pay maintenance costs for their vehicle themselves, with only 20% having a maintenance plan for their car. Another 20% said they actively save and plan for maintenance costs, while 5% said they did not plan for maintenance expenses at all. “These results confirm that too many people are relying on their car to never break down and, when it does, they would rather pay out of pocket than have a financial plan – such as a paid maintenance plan – in place,” said David Chard, Managing Director of AA Warranties. Chard also highlighted several steps that vehicle owners should take to ensure their vehicle runs for longer, including: “If you are going on holiday in December you cannot gamble with a vehicle that is not properly serviced or maintained,” said the AA. “Apart from the fact that a breakdown could ruin your holiday plans, driving in a vehicle which has not been regularly serviced is dangerous to you and other drivers, and could, in the long run, cost you a whole lot more than just the cost of a service.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-325433" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/South-African-car-stats-AA-280x430.jpg" alt="South African car stats - AA" width="640" height="983" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/South-African-car-stats-AA-280x430.jpg 280w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/South-African-car-stats-AA-260x400.jpg 260w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/South-African-car-stats-AA-768x1179.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/South-African-car-stats-AA-1200x1843.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/South-African-car-stats-AA.jpg 1518w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
