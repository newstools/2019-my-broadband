Etv has partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA), which appointed the broadcaster as its official free-to-air broadcast partner in South Africa. As part of the agreement, Etv will broadcast more than 65 games throughout the 2019-20 NBA season across the channel and its Openview platform. Content will include one Christmas Day game, NBA All-Star, the NBA Conference Finals, The Finals, and weekly magazine show NBA Action. The coverage will begin when Etv broadcasts the live game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Boston Celtics on 9 November. A rebroadcast of this game will be aired at 17:00 on Sunday. Throughout the season, fans will be able to watch two games per week, including one live game as part of the league’s “NBA Saturdays” initiative and one delayed game per week. “We have always strived to make the game of basketball more accessible to our fans through participation in our sport and exposure, and we are thrilled to partner with e.tv in South Africa,” said NBA Africa Managing Director Amadou Gallo Fall. “As we continue our efforts to expand our footprint and build on the success of three sold-out NBA Africa Games, we have seen growing interest and look forward to reaching more fans in South Africa through live games and additional programming.” Etv managing director Marlon Davids said that the partnership will appeal to South Africa’s insatiable sporting appetite. “Over the past few years, we have been implementing strategic growth plans that will ensure that our sports content offering across our platforms is worthwhile for our viewers.” “We are ecstatic about this announcement and we greatly look forward to a fruitful run with the NBA,” Davids said.
