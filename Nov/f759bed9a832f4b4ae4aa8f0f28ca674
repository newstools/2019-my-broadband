Google has responded to complaints from gamers about the lack of full 4K support in several Stadia titles. When the cloud gaming service was originally announced, the company said that Stadia would offer full 4K support at 60 frames per second, provided the user had a sufficient Internet connection. However, after its official launch on 19 November, a number of reports indicated that certain games are running at a lower resolution than the 4,096 x 2,160 Google said Stadia would deliver. In an analysis of Red Dead Redemption 2 on Stadia, Digital Foundry discovered that the title runs at a native 2,560 x 1,440 resolution. The Chromecast Ultra then upscales this to 4K. A source from game publisher Bungie also confirmed that Stadia’s iteration of Destiny 2 runs at the equivalent of medium settings on the PC version and at a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080, which is also upscaled to 4K upon streaming. Google reiterated that the full workflow of streaming on Stadia occurs in 4K. “Stadia streams at 4K and 60fps – and that includes all aspects of our graphics pipeline from game to screen: GPU, encoder, and Chromecast Ultra all outputting at 4K to 4K TVs, with the appropriate Internet connection,” the statement reads. The company said that the lower in-game native resolutions are determined by the game developers. “We give developers the freedom of how to achieve the best image quality and frame rate on Stadia,” the company said.
