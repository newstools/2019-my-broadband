Rain has recently launched an online RICA process which removes the need to physically wait for a RICA-certified agent to activate a SIM. The Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act 70 of 2002 (better known as RICA) came into effect on the 1 July 2011. RICA aims to combat organised crime by ensuring that telecoms providers collect and keep records of all their customers, which include ID numbers and residential addresses. Service providers are obligated to verify that the information which they collect are accurate. This is typically done by the person involved in the RICA process. Until now, it was necessary for people to go to a physical store or wait for a RICA agent to visit them to activate a SIM or other telecoms service. Rain has changed this process by allowing its new subscribers to RICA and activate their SIM through an easy-to-use online process. Rain’s chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga told MyBroadband that new Rain customers can visit the company’s website and follow three easy steps to activate their SIM: “A customer will have to have a valid South African identity document and a proof of residence that is no more than 3 months old,” Dlanga said. He explained that with Rain’s online RICA, customers no longer have to physically wait for a RICA certified agent to activate their SIM. “They can RICA and activate their SIM from the comfort of their home, the beach, or a bus bench. Anywhere,” said Dlanga. He said the response to the online RICA process has been positive so far, and that it has been especially helpful to those customers who purchased Rain SIMs through Takealot.
