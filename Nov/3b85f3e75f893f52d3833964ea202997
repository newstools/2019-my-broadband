Samsung has started rolling out a stable version of Android 10 on the Galaxy S10, SamMobile reports. A beta version of Google’s new mobile OS was already available to testers in several countries, including the US, South Korea and Germany. The latter is the only country in which the stable build is currently available. The latest update is labelled as software version “G97**XXU3BSKO”, and comes with the December security patch with a total size of 140MB. This smaller size is because the update is currently only available to participants of the One UI 2.0 beta program, who are already running a beta of the Android 10 software. According to Samsung’s reported roadmap for Android 10, the update will likely be available to all Galaxy S10 and Note 10 users in January 2020. The Galaxy S9 and mid-range A series is expected to get Android 10 in April 2020, while other Galaxy A phones will receive the update in May 2020. Google first launched Android 10 on its Pixel smartphones in early September. The OS comes with a host of new features, including a dark mode, smart replies for all messaging apps, support for 5G technology and foldable displays, and more than 50 new privacy and security changes.
