The Acer Predator Triton 500 laptop is an elegant and powerful piece of hardware, with use cases that stretch beyond gaming. Acer’s Predator lineup features a range of gaming products, such as performance-oriented monitors, laptops, and accessories which cater to the most demanding gamers. Since I purchased my own entry-level Acer Predator Helios 300 gaming laptop, I have spent many entertaining hours running graphically-intensive titles at respectable framerates. While the Helios series offers high-end gaming in a relatively portable form-factor, the Triton range takes easy mobility to a whole new level. The Predator Triton 500 is Acer’s thin-and-light gaming laptop offering, and it epitomises the phrase “dynamite comes in small packages”. Acer South Africa kindly provided MyBroadband with a unit we could put to the test. The Predator Triton 500’s screen looks sleek thanks to its thin top and side bezels. Our review unit came with a 15.6-inch 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display which boasted a 144Hz refresh rate. The latter makes the viewing experience satisfying in more than just gaming. When scrolling through web pages and text or navigating through applications on the desktop, the higher frame rate makes everything look and feel smoother. Colours on the IPS display appear vivid and sharp, and the display’s brightness levels are notably impressive. It was easy to see detail on the screen while sitting outside in the midday sun, although most users would rarely require this. Gamers will also be happy to hear that the screen supports Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, eliminating screen tearing in gaming without affecting response times. The Predator Triton 500 packs an immense amount of computing power into a compact build. In our unit, an Intel Core i7-8750H with a clock speed of up to 4.1GHz was paired with 32GB of DDR4 RAM. Two super-fast NVMe SSDs deliver a total of 500GB of storage. All these components make the Triton 500 suitable for running programs with heavy processing requirements at excellent speeds. The Triton 500 is made for high-performance gaming, however, and boasts immense graphical capabilities thanks to its RTX 2080 Max-Q with 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM. The RTX 2080 Max-Q may be slightly less powerful than its desktop counterpart, but it certainly does not show any weakness in any of the games we tested. Newer games like The Outer Worlds and Gears 5 are very playable at maximum settings, with frame rates typically ranging between 80 and 100 FPS. Other popular titles, like Apex Legends and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, run at around 100 FPS. A dedicated button opens Acer’s PredatorSense application, which allows for the custom configuration of fan speeds and overclocking settings, among other adjustments. An additional Turbo Boost button overclocks the GPU and increases fan speed to the maximum in one press. The laptop feels solid and is comfortable to carry and work on whilst placed on your lap. Its lid and body is made with aluminium and finished in matte black, with a prominent Predator logo in the centre that lights up in blue when the laptop is on. Its keyboard sports triple-zone RGB lighting, with various colours and timing configurations for the keys accessible through PredatorSense. After a couple of days of travelling with the laptop, it’s clear that the Triton 500 holds up well in terms of versatility. The laptop’s refined design means it can easily double as a professional workstation for creative multimedia editing and consumption. The typing experience is pleasant, and the keyboard is spaced out enough that you will rarely hit the wrong button. The trackpad is also great to use and supports Windows-precision drivers for pin-point accurate mouse navigation. Where many slim laptops scale down on port availability, the Triton 500 has no shortage of options for expandability. It can connect several peripherals at once, with three USB 3.0 ports, one Thunderbolt 3 port, an HDMI port, and Mini DisplayPort. The 84Wh battery allows for about six hours of general use and can charge up to 100% in less than two hours. In a detailed comparison of the battery life of similar laptops, AnandTech showed that the Triton 500 comes out on top in most tests. The Acer Predator Triton 500 is available from Acer’s online shop and Takealot from R44,999. <img class="size-full wp-image-326295 aligncenter"
