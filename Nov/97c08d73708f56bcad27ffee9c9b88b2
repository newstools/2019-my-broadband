Eskom recently warned South Africans of fraudsters posing as Eskom employees or recruitment agents. These scammers attempt to defraud people by pretending to be an Eskom representative and offering false tenders, or procurement deals. Fraudsters are also posing as recruitment agents which offer victims jobs in exchange for a down payment. Their targets have included everyone from small businesses to disabled people. “Emanating from numerous reports made to Eskom Forensic, involving a number of procurement and recruitment scams that are resurfacing, Eskom wishes to warn the public about the scams involving a fraudster(s) posing as either Eskom employees or Eskom appointed recruitment agents,” Eskom said. “The most recent spate of recruitments scams involves Eskom Lethabo and Kusile Power Stations.” Eskom provided examples of some of these scams, which include procurement, tender, and recruitment scams. We have outlined a few of these scams below. Fraudsters are posing as Eskom recruitment agents in an attempt to exploit their victims’ need for a stable and well-paying job. Once a victim has responded to the fake job advert, they are asked for a fixed sum of money before they are “guaranteed” the position. Of course, once the fraudster has received the money from the “applicant”, they are never heard from again. One recruitment scam saw an Eskom advert posted on Indeed claiming to offer jobs to disabled people, promising them a salary of R19,000 per month. “A member of the public called to enquire if there are vacancies in Musina area, there was an advertisement on the Internet under www.indeed.co.za – Musina vacancies (Eskom Jobs) regarding Eskom Recruitment in Musina Power Station, so she was looking for a job for Eskom for disabled people,” Eskom’s stated in its report of the incident. The scammer asked the victim to pay R2,200 to undergo “medicals” before her employment could be confirmed. In another case, a fraudster claiming to be an employee of Eskom offered victims guaranteed positions at the power utility in exchange for a “cold drink” payment of R3,500. These scams are proliferated over email, WhatsApp, printed material, and social media, as shown below: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326487" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-recruitment-scam.jpg" alt="Eskom recruitment scam" width="640" height="775" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-recruitment-scam.jpg 1015w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-recruitment-scam-330x400.jpg 330w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-recruitment-scam-768x930.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-recruitment-scam-355x430.jpg 355w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Eskom also warned of fraudsters circulating false tender forms for work at its Medupi and Kusile power stations, as well as procurement scams. In one example, false procurement quotations were sent from a domain named “eskomprojects.com”, with the sender impersonating a supply chain manager at Eskom. False tender forms include official-looking details and logos, and many are concerned with prepaid meter hardware. Below is an image of a tender scam targeted at South Africans. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326489" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-tender-scam.jpg" alt="Eskom tender scam" width="640" height="625" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-tender-scam.jpg 1381w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-tender-scam-409x400.jpg 409w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-tender-scam-768x750.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-tender-scam-440x430.jpg 440w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eskom-tender-scam-1200x1172.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
