Google has announced the final line-up of titles that will be available on its Google Stadia cloud gaming platform in 2019. The list includes 12 games that will be playable at launch on 19 November, as well as 14 more titles coming before the end of the year. Stadia subscribers will require a minimum Internet connection speed of 10Mbps to stream high-requirement games on basic hardware, but will still need to purchase copies of the game through the Stadia app. Buyers of both the Founderâ€™s Edition and Premiere Edition of Google Stadia will receive a three-month Stadia Pro subscription, which includes Destiny 2. At launch, the service will be available in 14 territories, including the US, Canada, UK, and several European countries. South Africans will have to wait, however, as a local release date for the service has not been announced. Below are the titles that will be available on Google Stadia in 2019. <img class="size-large wp-image-327209 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AC-Odyssey-607x430.jpg" alt="" width="607" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AC-Odyssey-607x430.jpg 607w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AC-Odyssey-565x400.jpg 565w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AC-Odyssey-768x544.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AC-Odyssey.jpg 829w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-327211 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Metro-Exodus-617x430.jpg" alt="" width="617" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Metro-Exodus-617x430.jpg 617w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Metro-Exodus-574x400.jpg 574w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Metro-Exodus-768x535.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Metro-Exodus.jpg 852w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Google has confirmed that several other games will be coming to the platform in 2020, including Cyberpunk 2077, Doom: Eternal, WatchDogs: Legion, and Gods & Monsters.
