CTU Training Solutions was recently awarded the CAPP Delivery Partner of the Year 2019 award at CompTIA’s third biennial partner awards event in Johannesburg. “CTU is honoured to have won the CompTIA Partner award for the second time. This award serves to confirm our commitment to the CompTIA partnership and recognition by CompTIA of our commitment to the development of skills in South Africa,” says Sharon Oosterberg, CTU’s CompTIA business development manager. The CompTIA South Africa partner awards event recognises training partners and corporate customers who use CompTIA certifications to drive skills development in South Africa. CTU is a private tertiary education institution which offers a variety of training opportunities spanning full-time, part-time, and corporate training options. The IDC whitepaper “Impact of Certifications and Training on Career Milestones” found that CompTIA certificates provide a huge advantage to those who attain them. CompTIA certified IT professionals are promoted nearly twice as often as those who aren’t, and overwhelmingly outperform those who aren’t certified across security- and network-related activities. Certified IT professionals are also 50% more likely to be promoted in their first year on the job, and have up to 30% more influence than their unqualified peers. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-327363" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ctu-640x427.jpg" alt="ctu" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ctu-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ctu-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ctu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ctu-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ctu.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> CTU Training Solutions is a leading partner of CompTIA, as evidenced by its winning of the CAPP Delivery Partner of the Year 2019 award.
