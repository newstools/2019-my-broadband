The VC200 features a 4K camera, although it “only” transmits video in 1080P. This allows the VC200 to offer excellent digital pan/tilt/zoom capabilities, without the image loss that is traditionally associated with digital video enhancement. <img class="size-large wp-image-327183 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vc200-640x244.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="244" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vc200.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vc200-600x229.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Combining a self-built 5G Wi-Fi, WPP20, the wireless presentation pod, partners up with Yealink new-generation Video Conferencing System to offer high-quality wireless content sharing with just one tap.
