Black Friday 2019 is here, and many South African Internet service providers and mobile operators are offering excellent deals on fibre and other broadband products. In South Africa, Black Friday was initially associated with online shopping, but it has now grown in popularity and many brick-and-mortar retailers have also launched specials on the day. Mobile operators and Internet service providers (ISPs) have also joined the party with excellent deals on mobile data products and fibre connections. This year, South Africans are spoiled for choice with many mobile operators and ISPs offering big price cuts on fibre-to-the-home products and mobile data packages. Mind the Speed, for example, is offering new clients up to four months of free uncapped fibre on Vumatel, Openserve, Frogfoot, MetroFibre, and SADVâ€™s fibre networks. Not to be outdone, RSAWEB is offering new fibre subscribers free installation, free setup, free mobile data, and a free UPS as part of its Black Friday deal. Vodacom has also launched an aggressive Black Friday deal, offering its existing contract subscribers the option to add 20GB of data per month for an additional R179. The business market will also be served. MetroFibre is offering businesses a 1Gbps business Internet Access package for only R7,999 per month. Here are some of the best 2019 Black Friday broadband deals in South Africa.
