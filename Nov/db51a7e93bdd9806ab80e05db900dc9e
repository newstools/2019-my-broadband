Dantley Davis, Twitter’s VP of design and research, has tweeted a list of features that he said he is “excited to explore” in 2020. These features would give users increased agency over who can interact with their tweets and how they can do so. The changes that Davis is “looking forward to in 2020” include the following options for Twitter users: The ability to block your tweets from being retweeted by other users is particularly interesting, as it offers a way of ensuring that a tweet meant only for their followers does not go viral. This could be used as a “half-way” measure between a traditional, open Twitter account, and an invite-only account. Twitter told The Verge that these are simply ideas that Twitter is exploring, meaning that many of these features may never be implemented. “The features mentioned are ideas we’re exploring – explorations and experimentation have always been part of our process. We’ll have more to share should we decide to move forward with any of them,” said a Twitter spokesperson.
