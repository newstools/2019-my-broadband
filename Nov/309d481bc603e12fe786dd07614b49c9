Eskom has said in a press statement that a tornado in New Hanover has affected its power distribution network, resulting in downtime for over 15,000 customers. “Supply to about 5,000 customers was restored overnight and work is currently going on to restore power to the rest of the affected customers,” said Eskom. “Some structures and lines are down, so restoration will take longer than usual as we will ensure that lines are safe to energise before we do.” Eskom has urged customers to avoid low hanging conductors and fallen structures, and to report any sightings of such situations to its Contact Centre on 086 003 7566. “Customers are also advised to treat all installations as live for safety reasons,” said Eskom. Eskom thanked customers for their patience during the outage caused by the storm. Eskom has released a separate statement which claims that while the system remains constrained and vulnerable, no load-shedding is expected today. However, the threat of controlled blackouts remains due to unplanned breakdowns of energy sources totalling 9,500MW. These breakdowns mean that Eskom is using emergency resources at a high rate, which increases the probability of load-shedding if supply constraints are sustained for a long period. “We remind customers that load-shedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout.
