SIM cards are usually quite robust and can last for years without any problems, but they are not immune to damage or other issues. If you have a faulty or damaged SIM card, your mobile operator will be able to offer you a replacement while also allowing you to keep your number. This is not a free service, however, and its cost can vary depending on whether you are a contract or a prepaid customer. Contract customers are charged significantly more by all local networks for SIM card replacement, a fact which is commonly attributed to administration costs and related fees. To determine exactly how much it costs to replace a SIM card for prepaid and contract customers, MyBroadband spoke to Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom. MTN told MyBroadband that postpaid SIM card replacement costs include connection and administration fees, which could account for their higher cost. “MTN sim card costs R3.49 for prepaid customers, while for postpaid sim card replacement costs R115,” the company said. “It is important to note that postpaid sim card costs include administrative costs such as SIM swap and connection fees.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-281319" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MTN-3.jpg" alt="MTN Store" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MTN-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MTN-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MTN-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cell C has different rates for SIM card replacements depending on whether a user buys a SIM themselves and resolves the issue over the phone or visits a Cell C store. “In order to replace a faulty SIM card a SIM swap needs to be completed,” the company told MyBroadband. “If a contract subscriber purchases a SIM card at the cost of R1, then it will cost them R50.44 if the SIM swap is done telephonically.” “Alternatively, they can process the SIM swap at a Cell C store at the cost of R150.” “If a prepaid subscriber purchases a SIM card at the cost of R1 then the SIM swap is free telephonically and R10 in-store,” Cell C added. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262637" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cell-C-logo.jpg" alt="Cell C logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cell-C-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cell-C-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Cell-C-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Telkom offers free SIM replacement for contract and prepaid customers. “Telkom does not charge a fee to replace sim cards for both contract and prepaid customers,” the network told MyBroadband. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221555" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Telkom-office-mockup-logo.jpg" alt="Telkom office mockup logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Telkom-office-mockup-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Telkom-office-mockup-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Telkom-office-mockup-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Vodacom did not respond by the time of publication.
