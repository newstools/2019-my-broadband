Delegates will also be able to interact with Angola Cables CEO António Nunes and the company’s marketing manager Samuel Carvalho. Angola Cables has made great strides over the last year, which include growing its South African customer base and launching a hub for undersea cables connecting Africa and America. The company’s South Atlantic Cable System (SACS) connects Sangano in Angola to Fortaleza in Brazil, and it launched commercial services in September 2018. Sangono, in turn, is connected to South Africa via several undersea cables to offer services locally. Nunes said since the launch last year SACS has made a considerable improvement to connectivity in the Southern hemisphere. This has served as a catalyst for the expansion of Internet exchange points, the cutting of data traffic time, and a reduction in costs for operators. With Angola Cables’ infrastructure now ready and its network fully operational, the main focus is maximizing its usage with new and existing customers. “The Southern hemisphere has some of the world’s lowest levels of connectivity; access to fast, stable and secure Internet remains a luxury for many,” said Nunes. “Recognising this, Angola Cables remains committed to driving connectivity in the Southern hemisphere to improve economic development and technological growth.”
