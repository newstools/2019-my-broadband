iStore has released pricing for the new Apple MacBook Pro as part of a pre-order campaign. The 16-inch MacBook Pro was launched by Apple earlier this month and features a range of hardware improvements compared to its predecessors. The new laptops are powered by up to an Intel octa-core processor and 64GB of RAM. They also include a new keyboard design, a 16-inch Retina Display, and more powerful GPUs. Apple stated that the display boasts a resolution of 3,072 x 1,920 and a pixel density of 226ppi. A six-speaker sound system, longer battery life, Touch Bar, Touch ID, a Force Touch trackpad, and Apple’s T2 Security Chip are additional features included with the new device. The local pricing for the two 16-inch MacBook Pro models available at the time of writing from the iStore are below. Colour options are Space Grey or Silver. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-327509 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-640x416.jpg" alt="Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-640x416.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-600x390.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-768x499.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319-1200x779.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_Retina-Display_111319.jpg 1632w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-327515" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1.jpg" alt="Macbook Pro 1" width="640" height="448" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1.jpg 1286w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1-572x400.jpg 572w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1-768x537.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1-614x430.jpg 614w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Macbook-Pro-1-1200x840.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-327503 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-640x367.jpg" alt="Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319" width="640" height="367" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-640x367.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-600x344.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-768x441.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319-1200x689.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_New-Magic-Keyboard_111319.jpg 1286w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327499" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MacBook-Pro-headline-.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro headline" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MacBook-Pro-headline-.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MacBook-Pro-headline--300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MacBook-Pro-headline--595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
