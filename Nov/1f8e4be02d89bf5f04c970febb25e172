Images filed with the Japanese Patent Office have provided the first look at what the upcoming PlayStation 5 controller may look like. According to these sketches, there doesn’t appear to be much that is significantly different when compared with the current DualShock 4 controller, but there are some minor changes. The PlayStation 5 controller doesn’t appear to have a light bar, which could result in superior battery life – especially when combined with the improved battery Sony is planning on using in the controller. The controller in the images also appears to sport slightly larger triggers, and it looks to have dropped the two-tone design. The thumbsticks will remain symmetrical, continuing the trend that Microsoft bucked with the Xbox. Sony previously announced that it will adopt haptic feedback to replace the traditional “rumble” technology in its controllers – offering a better range of vibrations and improved immersion. The company will also change the way its controllers’ triggers work, with the new triggers allowing developers to manipulate resistance depending on in-game events. Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan announced in October that the PlayStation 5 will launch in “holiday 2020.” Images of the PlayStation 5 controller patent filing can be viewed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-328181" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5.png" alt="ps5" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-328183" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_3-574x430.png" alt="" width="574" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_3-574x430.png 574w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_3-534x400.png 534w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_3-768x576.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_3-1536x1151.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_3-1200x899.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 85vw, 574px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-328185" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_2-574x430.png" alt="" width="574" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_2-574x430.png 574w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_2-534x400.png 534w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_2-768x576.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_2-1536x1151.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_2-1200x899.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ps5_2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 85vw, 574px" />
