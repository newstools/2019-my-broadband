One of Wikipedia’s founders has launched a social network which he believes could be better than Facebook. WT:Social is the creation of British-American web entrepreneur Jimmy Wales. The platform was launched last month and, according to The Next Web, it has reached around 50,000 users. The network has no financial relationship with Wikipedia, although it uses a similar business model. Instead of relying on advertising for its funding, WT:Social is dependent on donations. To join the new platform, users can sign up to be placed on a waiting list. After we submitted a request to join, we were placed at number 39,341 on the list. There is also an option to pay $13 per month or $100 per year, which provides instant access to the platform. The current interface is relatively bare, with a feed that consists of news stories, comments, and SubWikis which users can follow to stay up to date on particular topics of interest. The site emphasises the provision of trustworthy news articles. Every story that is posted on the network mentions the source of the article, in addition to other related references. Wales told the Financial Times that the way in which social networks like Facebook and Twitter are funded creates problems. “The business model of social media companies, of pure advertising, is problematic. It turns out the huge winner is low-quality content,” Wales said.
