The Acer Nitro 7 gaming notebook is the perfect solution for casual and competitive gamers alike, offering a perfect balance of portability and performance. It packs powerful hardware into a compact, refined chassis which is robust and light enough to carry around easily. When it comes to competitive gaming, stand-out specifications include a high refresh rate display with low response times, as well as reliable performance and exceptional audio. The Acer Nitro 7’s small form factor also caters to gamers looking for a powerful and lightweight gaming notebook that won’t take up their entire desk. Acer kindly provided MyBroadband with a Nitro 7 gaming laptop to test out. Like many modern gaming laptops, the Acer Nitro 7 packs powerful components into a slim and unobtrusive chassis. This design delivers a lightweight gaming laptop which is not only energy-efficient but also impressively powerful. The device sports a dedicated Nvidia GeForce GTX 16 Series graphics card and an Intel Core i7 processor, which should allow it to tackle most games in your Steam library without any problems. Acer has also equipped the Nitro 7 with a 144Hz Full HD IPS panel, which quickly became a major highlight of the device after only a few games. The panel has a response time of 3ms which, when playing at 144FPS, makes for smooth, flawless gameplay that can’t be replicated on a lower refresh-rate display. Another much-appreciated feature of the Acer Nitro 7 was its pair of 512GB solid-state drives in a RAID 0 setup, which delivered more high-speed storage for frequently-accessed games. If you ever owned an older gaming laptop, you probably had to deal with unwieldy and cumbersome notebooks that had massive frames and even larger heat signatures. Things are different now, however – advancements in chassis design and component efficiency allow gamers to practice their CS:GO in coffee shops without attracting the disapproval of other customers. In most cases, this is because gaming laptops are becoming as sleek and lightweight as their professional counterparts. The Acer Nitro 7 is a prime example of this design trend. The Nitro 7 is a stylish device with an aggressive, angular chassis and red-coloured keycaps, but it also shares the slim profile and dimensions of many professional laptops. A major factor in reducing the footprint of gaming laptops is the development of internal cooling systems, as there are powerful components inside the Nitro 7 that emit a fair amount of heat. Acer implemented a dual exhaust port design and its CoolBoost technology on the Nitro 7, which allows the hardware in the device to work hard without affecting performance. The manufacturer has also implemented an improved audio system for the device, and the Nitro 7 comes equipped with a suite of software which allows you to manage, temperature, audio levels, and various other settings to best suit your needs. This combination of technology and design decisions has produced a gaming laptop which is portable, lightweight, and versatile while also delivering killer performance, making it the ultimate mobile battle station for serious gamers. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326813" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-2.jpg" alt="Acer Nitro 7 2" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-2.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-2-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-2-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326811" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-1.jpg" alt="Acer Nitro 7 1" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-1.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-1-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-1-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326821" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-6.jpg" alt="Acer Nitro 7 6" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-6.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-6-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-6-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326815" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-3.jpg" alt="Acer Nitro 7 3" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-3.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-3-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-3-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326819" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-5.jpg" alt="Acer Nitro 7 5" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-5.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-5-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-5-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326817" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-4.jpg" alt="Acer Nitro 7 4" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-4.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-4-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Nitro-7-4-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
