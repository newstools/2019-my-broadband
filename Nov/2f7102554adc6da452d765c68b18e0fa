Samsung’s next flagship smartphone could boast a rectangular penta-camera setup and a 120Hz display, according to a report from 91Mobiles. The site collaborated with tech leaker Steve H. McFly, also known as OnLeaks, who compiled the various rumours about the Samsung Galaxy S11 to create a concept design. OnLeaks has previously created accurate early renders of the Galaxy Note 10, iPhone 11, Pixel 4 XL, and other devices. According to the images, the front camera’s hole punch is now located at the centre-top of the screen, rather than on the right. The bezels at the top and bottom of the phone are thinner than on the Galaxy S10, while the side bezels remain roughly the same. The most noteworthy feature, however, is the rectangular rear camera array of five sensors. This includes the rumoured 108MP camera, which has already been seen in the Xiaomi Mi MIX Alpha. The S11 is expected to boast a top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, with 8GB RAM and 256GB internal storage. A previous report claimed the screen will also sport a 120Hz refresh rate. If Samsung sticks to its regular release schedule, the Galaxy S11 will be unveiled in February 2020. The renders below are taken from 91Mobiles. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-329253 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_1-1068x601-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_1-1068x601-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_1-1068x601-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_1-1068x601-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_1-1068x601.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-329255 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_3-1068x601-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_3-1068x601-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_3-1068x601-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_3-1068x601-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_3-1068x601.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-329257 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_4-1068x601-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_4-1068x601-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_4-1068x601-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_4-1068x601-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_5K_render_4-1068x601.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="wp-image-329259 size-large aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_7-1068x601-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_7-1068x601-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_7-1068x601-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_7-1068x601-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_7-1068x601.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-329261 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_3-1068x601-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_3-1068x601-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_3-1068x601-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_3-1068x601-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Samsung_Galaxy_S11_render_3-1068x601.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
