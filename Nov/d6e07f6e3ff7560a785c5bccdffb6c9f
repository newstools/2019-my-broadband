Google wants to identify and label pages that load slowly as a result of bad or flawed development. The “speed badging” feature was described in a Chromium blog post and uses historical load latencies to indicate whether a website generally offers a fast or slow loading experience. “In the future, Chrome may identify sites that typically load fast or slow for users with clear badging. This may take a number of forms and we plan to experiment with different options, to determine which provides the most value to our users,” the post stated. Web loading speed is a big focus of this year’s Chrome Developer Summit, and Google has provided developers with several tools to help improve website performance. Currently, an experimental version of the feature uses the loading screen to deliver a message notifying the user if a website has a history of sluggish performance. It also uses loading bars of different colours, with a green bar used for sites with perceived better performance. The picture below shows an example of the feature on a badly-authored web page on the left compared to a well-optimised site on the right. <img class="size-full wp-image-327219 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Chrome-slow-loading-badge-.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Chrome-slow-loading-badge-.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Chrome-slow-loading-badge--300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Chrome-slow-loading-badge--595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Google also plans to expand the feature to indicate whether a page is slow because of a user’s network quality or device. The company has not announced an official roll-out for this “speed badging” feature.
