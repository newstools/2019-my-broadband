WhatsApp has launched a minor beta update – version 2.19.331 – through the Google Play Beta Program, WABetaInfo reports. As part of this update, WhatsApp has added Facebook’s new logo to a variety of pages within the app. Pages that display this new logo include WhatsApp Settings, the welcome screen, and the splash screen. Facebook recently updated its corporate logo to separate its corporate business from its social media platform. “The new branding was designed for clarity, and uses custom typography and capitalization to create visual distinction between the company and app,” Facebook said. “This brand change is a way to better communicate our ownership structure to the people and businesses who use our services to connect, share, build community and grow their audiences.” The latest beta update of WhatsApp does not yet include the upcoming dark theme, as WhatsApp is still working on polishing this feature. According to WABetaInfo, the dark theme is essentially “perfect”, but WhatsApp is making minor adjustments to icon colours. Previous reports have indicated that once WhatsApp’s dark theme is implemented, it will be accessible through a new section in WhatsApp’s Settings menu entitled Theme Settings. Users will then have three choices – Light Theme, Dark Theme, and System Default.
