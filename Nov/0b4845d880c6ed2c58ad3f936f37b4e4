Microsoft has unveiled the logo for its upcoming Chromium-based Edge browser. The logo was hidden inside a mini-game in the latest Canary versions of Edge. The new logo looks is a blue-and-green-coloured wave in the shape of the letter “E” which bears little resemblance to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer logo. Internet Explorer dominated the browser market in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, largely due to being bundled with Windows. However, after suffering serious security exploits in Internet Explorer 6, which included key-logging and backdoor malware that exposed personal user information such as credit card credentials, the browser started to fall out of favour. With the arrival of Mozilla Firefox in 2005 and Google Chrome in 2008, users switched to browsers that had better overall security and support for features like plugins and extensions. Microsoft attempted to revitalise Internet Explorer by renaming the browser “Edge” in 2015. Even though Edge has solid security and low RAM usage, it was not enough to convince most Firefox and Chrome users to switch. Microsoft has now opted to base the new version of Edge on Google’s open-source web browser, Chromium. A beta version of this browser was released in August. Microsoft is yet to announce an official release date for the final version. The Verge stated that more information about the browser will likely be revealed at Microsoft’s Ignite Conference this week.
