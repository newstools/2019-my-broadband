Facebook has launched a new market research app called Viewpoints which will pay users to participate in surveys, tasks, and other research. Users who have a Facebook Viewpoints account will be invited to join programmes and will be told prior to their participation what information will be collected, how it will be used, and how many points they will receive for completing the task. These points can be converted to cash and sent to their PayPal account once certain thresholds have been reached. Facebook said it will use the insights garnered from these programmes to improve its product range, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Portal, and Oculus. Facebook has unveiled its first programme on Viewpoints – a well-being survey that focuses on social media usage. “We want to better understand how the use of social media like Facebook can impact people’s well-being,” said Facebook. “Information from this survey will help us build better products that aim to limit the negative impacts of social media and enhance the benefits.” The Viewpoints app is currently only open to people in the United States who are 18 or older and have Facebook accounts. Facebook said it was looking to expand Viewpoints into more countries in 2020.
