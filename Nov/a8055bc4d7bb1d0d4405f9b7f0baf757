Valve has revealed its first new Half-Life game in 12 years. The announcement came in a tweet from the publisher yesterday, which unveiled the title of the game – Half Life: Alyx. The company said that the game would be a flagship VR title and would be officially revealed on 21 November. The last game released under the Half-Life name was 2007’s Half Life 2: Episode Two. Although it is not clear whether Half-Life: Alyx will follow on from that story, its title implies that it could focus on Alyx Vance, a prominent ally to Gordon Freeman, who was the main protagonist of the previous Half-Life titles. A leak of a Game Awards interview suggested that Half-Life: Alyx would be a VR-only game that will be showcased at The Game Awards on 12 December and could be ready for launch in March 2020. Virtual reality might not be enjoying widespread popularity, but a Half-Life VR title could make sense for Valve. The company offers a VR headset of its own, the Valve Index, and including a renowned title like Half-Life in Steam’s VR game library could persuade some PC gamers to purchase the Index VR kit. We’re excited to unveil Half-Life: Alyx, our flagship VR game, this Thursday at 10am Pacific Time. Can’t wait to share it with all of you! pic.twitter.com/BupFCxSrTw — Valve (@valvesoftware) November 18, 2019
