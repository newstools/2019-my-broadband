Clientele Limited has launched Clientele Mobile, which offers data and airtime at discounted rates for Clientele Rewards members through the Clientele App. Clientele Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), similar to Virgin Mobile, which is running on Cell C’s network. A new Clientele Mobile SIM costs R30 and comes with 100MB of free data on activation. Clientele Rewards members receive an additional 100MB after the first rewards fee payment and another 100MB after the second Rewards fee payment. There are multiple packages available, including data packages of 50MB, 100MB, 300MB, 500MB, 1GB, 2GB, and 5GB. Clientele Mobile airtime is offered at any chosen amount. “Clientele Mobile pricing is already competitive and offers Clientele Rewards members up to 20% additional discounts on data packages and between 25% and 35% discounts on airtime,” the company said. The first 10,000 members who purchase and activate their SIM card by 13 December 2019 will earn Clientele Mobile Founder Member status. “Founder Members are guaranteed to always receive a minimum discount of 25% on airtime and 15% on data every time they recharge their SIM on the Clientele App,” the company said.
