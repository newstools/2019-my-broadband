Huawei’s newest high-end smartphone, which was recently launched in South Africa, is the Nova 5T. The Nova 5T features a Kirin 980 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and a 6.26-inch display – powered by a 3,750mAh battery. Even more impressive, though, is its quad-camera system, which consists of a 48MP + 16MP + 2MP + 2MP sensor array. The rear-mounted AI cameras “capture stunning high-definition, ultra-wide-angle, macro, and bokeh photography”, said Huawei. “The cameras also create next-level videos. Rich, clear images and videos from vast landscapes to breathtaking close-ups.” The Nova 5T’s South African price tag of R12,499 puts it up again a range of Android smartphones, specifically the following: Among these phones, the Huawei Nova 5T comes out on top in several categories: It must also be noted that the Nova 5T supports an upgrade to the latest version of Android – Android 10. Another important indicator is the benchmark performance of devices. To determine the strong points of the Nova 5T, we compared its performance against its main rival the Samsung Galaxy S10e using AnTuTu benchmark results. The results are detailed below. As shown in the table, the Huawei Nova 5T beats the S10e in CPU and MEM benchmark performance rankings. The S10e edged out the Nova 5T in the GPU department, and the UX ranking is separated by just over a 1% difference. In the highly-competitive Android smartphone market, the Huawei Nova 5T offers impressive performance and hardware at a below-flagship price point. Its toughest competitor is the Samsung Galaxy S10e, and the two trade blows across the board – as evidenced above. The Galaxy S10e is more expensive than the Nova 5T, however, while the comparatively-priced Galaxy A80 does not perform as strongly as the Huawei device. Another more expensive option is the Nokia 9 Pureview, although this device is slightly older than its peers. The specification of the Nova 5T and images of the device are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-325899" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-Headline.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-Headline.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-Headline-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-Headline-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-325903 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T_-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T_-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T_-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T_-596x400.jpg 596w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T_-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T_-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T_.jpg 1726w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-325901 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-596x400.jpg 596w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Nova-5T.jpg 1577w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
