Leaked images of the Samsung Galaxy S11 smartphone have surfaced, providing an early glimpse at Samsung’s upcoming flagship device. According to OnLeaks, the Galaxy S11 will have five different camera lenses – adding a 3D time-of-flight sensor and another lens with a currently-unknown purpose. These leaks also show that the front-facing camera will be positioned centrally at the top of the device. This design was used in the Galaxy Note 10, with the Galaxy S11 having its camera in the corner of the device. The display of the largest Galaxy S11 device is expected to be 6.7 inches, with the overall size of the device being 161.9 x 73.7 x 7.8 mm. This display is expected to have a 120Hz refresh rate. Leaks also show that the device will have a glass back and a metal frame. The Galaxy S11 range is expected to comprise three devices – the Galaxy S11e, S11, and S11 Pro. The S11 is expected to boast 8GB of RAM and a minimum of 128GB internal storage – although a 512GB version could be made available, too. The Samsung Galaxy S11 range is expected to be unveiled in February 2020.
