Telkom users have reported network problems that are causing slow or no Internet connectivity. Downdetector has shown a spike in reports from Telkom customers since 10:00 on Wednesday. The issues appear to be affecting data for both Telkom mobile and fixed-LTE users. One user also stated that she is unable to send SMSs. The Downdetector map shows that the majority of reports stem from Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, and the Western Cape. Afrihost has also posted a notification on its Network Status page that indicates network issues with Telkom LTE in KwaZulu-Natal. “Please be aware of a Telkom LTE Network issue affecting clients in KwaZulu-Natal. Clients may be experiencing little to no connectivity. We are investigating the issue. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.” Several users have said that changing their APN settings from “Internet” to “Unrestricted” solved the issue. Others have stated that switching to 3G-only data restored their Internet connectivity. MyBroadband reached out to Telkom for comment, but the operator did not respond by time of writing. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326567 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Downdetector-Telkom-640x390.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Downdetector-Telkom-640x390.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Downdetector-Telkom-600x365.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Downdetector-Telkom-768x468.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Downdetector-Telkom.jpg 964w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
