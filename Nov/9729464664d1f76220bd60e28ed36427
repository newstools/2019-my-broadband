Afrihost has launched new fixed-LTE packages that run on MTN’s network. The packages are called Afrihost Pure LTE, and the ISP is offering one month of free usage on a range of SIM-only and SIM + device deals. The packages come with both anytime and nighttime data allocations. Afrihost also offers several fixed-LTE packages which run on Telkom’s network. Aside from data allocation and pricing, there are two notable differences between MTN and Telkom’s offerings. To ensure optimal network stability, MTN’s fixed-LTE can only be used with an approved router. MTN’s list includes the Huawei B525, B612, B618, and ZTE MF286. Additionally, MTN’s night data is valid from midnight to 06:00, while Telkom subscribers can consume their night data allocation between midnight and 07:00. The table below compares the monthly prices of Afrihost’s SIM-only packages on MTN and Telkom. The first data allocation shown is for anytime use, while the equivalent night data allocation is the second amount shown. Both network operators also offer data top-ups for their packages.
