Facebook is testing a feature called Popular Photos which allows users to scroll through pictures from their Facebook friends – much like users can already do on Instagram. TechCrunch spotted this feature, which allows users who have opened a photo on Facebook to scroll down and view more photos that Facebook thinks they may be interested in. As is the case with Instagram, image descriptions are heavily shortened to about 65 characters, meaning that the image remains the primary focus. Facebook previously had a “Photos” feature on its desktop version which allowed users to browse through Photos, but this no longer exists. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that it has been running a test of Popular Photos, but did not provide further details on why it is considering implementing this Instagram-like feature on Facebook. The tests, which ran in October, have since ceased, but Facebook has plans to do more tests moving forward. As Facebook works on expanding its content offering, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales recently launched a platform which aims to compete with the social media giant. The new ad-free platform, called WT:Social, has no financial relationship with Wikipedia but uses a similar model – asking for donations rather than displaying adverts to users. “The business model of social media companies, of pure advertising, is problematic. It turns out the huge winner is low-quality content,” Wales said.
