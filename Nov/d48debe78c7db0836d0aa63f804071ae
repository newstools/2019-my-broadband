Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has accused Goldman Sachs’ Apple Card algorithm of discriminating against women. Wozniak was responding to a complaint by tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson, who said he had been given 20-times the credit limit his wife had received. “Apple Card is a sexist program. It does not matter what the intent of individual Apple reps are, it matters what THE ALGORITHM they’ve placed their complete faith in does. And what it does is discriminate,” tweeted Hansson. “The same thing happened to us. We have no separate bank accounts or credit cards or assets of any kind. We both have the same high limits on our cards, including our AmEx Centurion card. But 10x on the Apple Card,” replied Wozniak. New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) has now made contact with Goldman Sachs over these allegations. According to a report by the BBC, the DFS said that it “will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex”. “Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law.” Responding to Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs said its algorithm for making credit decisions is not based on gender. “Our credit decisions are based on a customer’s creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.”
