RSAWEB has announced the roll-out of a new low-power radio access wide-area network (LoRaWAN). The network has already rolled out to 95% of Cape Town, with plans to expand to all of South Africa’s major metropolitan areas, as well as other African countries. LoRa is a wide-area network (WAN) technology that delivers lower bandwidth speeds and less power consumption than traditional 2G, 3G, and 4G technologies. The devices that operate on this network benefit from substantially longer-lasting batteries and better range capabilities, as the technology uses a lower band of the radio frequency spectrum. “RSAWEB has used the ISM band of 868Mhz to roll out LoRaWAN locally,” the company said. “This allows for deep coverage and penetration, with an open ecosystem that they can control, giving them the ability to expand into areas that are not economical for other technologies.” “The network will be expanded into metro and rural areas, as required, as part of a larger LoRaWAN network rollout strategy,” RSAWEB said. NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) is a similar technology that offers higher bandwidth, but reduced power efficiency. RSAWEB said that LoRaWAN is therefore ideal in areas that will not be served by NB-IoT, such as rural and agricultural regions. The company further stated that it believes space-based IoT is a promising new frontier, with devices that could be deployed to areas in the ocean to track temperatures, weather, tsunamis, and pollution.
