Frogfoot is rolling out fibre to the home (FTTH) infrastructure in Franschhoek, the network provider announced. Certain sections of the network will go live in the first quarter of 2020, said Frogfoot. “This area has not been covered up until this point, and there are many wine farms, residential estates, bed and breakfast accommodation, companies, and homes that stand to benefit tremendously from this new development,” said Shane Chorley, Head of Sales at Frogfoot. “Broadband connectivity will help to drive business, tourism and further growth in the Franschhoek Valley.” According to Chorley, any schools that are situated within Frogfoot’s coverage area will also be able to apply for a fibre link to their premises as part of Frogfoot’s schools promotion campaign. “This will give the schools access to a free FTTH connection of up to 1Gbps with their preferred Internet service provider,” said Chorley. Due to being an open-access provider, customers are able to use Frogfoot networks through over 60 ISPs. This allows users to choose between a variety of line speeds, as well as whether they want a capped or uncapped account.
