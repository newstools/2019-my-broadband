Black Friday 2019 is expected to reach record sales in South Africa, with many online and brick-and-mortar retailers offering special deals on the day. This year, Black Friday takes place on 29 November. This is the day after Thanksgiving in the United States and signals the start of the holiday shopping season. South African stores and consumers have embraced Black Friday and have made it the biggest online shopping day in the country. Black Friday has become so popular that many online shops in the country buckle under the load when their specials are launched. Grant Morgan, General Manager for Cloud at Dimension Data, said the traditional strategy of purchasing hardware to complement an existing system no longer works. Instead, Morgan said that the cloud offers the best solution for ensuring that a company’s website stays live on Black Friday. A 2018 Black Friday survey revealed that PC hardware, electronics, and clothing were the most popular purchases last year. Tech-savvy consumers preferred to use online channels to find the best deals and spent thousands of rand on the day. The majority of tech-savvy consumers said they only shopped online, while 28% said they shopped online and at brick-and-mortar stores. 21% of consumers said they shopped at brick-and-mortar stores only. According to research from GfK South Africa, televisions were particularly popular, with TV sales increasing by 66% to over 93,000 units on Black Friday 2018 compared to the year before. Takealot CEO Kim Reid said electronics proved to be a firm favourite on their platform, with over three thousand televisions sold on the day. Other top-selling items included perfume, camping gear, portable hard drives, and the DStv Explora decoder. While many retailers will only launch their deals on 27 November, a few local retailers are already offering price cuts. This week Pick n Pay launched its first weekly Black November deals for its online customers across Gauteng and the Western Cape. The company’s Black November deals will go live on Pick n Pay’s online shop every Monday at 07:00 and will be valid for seven days or until stocks last. A few other companies have also launched Black Friday deals in early November – here are the best specials. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-326331"
