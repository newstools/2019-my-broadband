Facebook could introduce a facial recognition system to verify the identity of users, according to app researcher Jane Manchun Wong. The system could make it harder for malicious actors to gain unauthorised access to accounts. Wong identified a reference to the tool in Facebook’s mobile app and detailed the functionality in a tweet yesterday. To analyse the user’s face, the feature requires the person to take a “video selfie” while looking in different directions. A notification states that the video will be seen by no one else and deleted 30 days after identity confirmation. Similar facial recognition systems, such as Apple’s Face ID only store the mathematical characteristics of the user’s face locally. Facebook currently employs facial recognition for photos posted on the platform. In early September, the company replaced its Tag Suggestions feature with Face Recognition, giving users the option of opting in or out of the feature. Before this, Facebook would automatically detect and notify a user if a photo of them has been uploaded. The development of the facial ID verification system may not sit well with sceptics of Facebook’s privacy policies, as the company previously received criticism over its protection of private user information. In July, the US Federal Trade Commission slammed Facebook with a R70-billion fine for various privacy violations.
