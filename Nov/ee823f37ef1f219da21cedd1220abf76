If you are a creator, developer, or professional who needs powerful hardware, then Acer’s ConceptD range is for you. Acer launched its ConceptD products in April 2019 – and after a global rollout, Acer South Africa kindly provided MyBroadband with two serious pieces of technology to review: If you thought your PC was powerful, you will need to sit down when you read this. The ConceptD 9 is an absolute beast and is packed with high-end components. The first thing you notice is the sleek, black metal body and the 17-inch 4K touchscreen display which is fitted to “Ezel Aero Hinges”. This allows users to position the screen at almost any angle, changing the PC from a “traditional” laptop layout to a “canvas” for designing on with the included stylus. Acer has ensured the 60Hz display meets high standards, and it offers 100% Adobe RGB gamut precision, Pantone-validated colour fidelity, and Delta E<1 colour accuracy. Delta E errors below 1 are considered imperceptible by even well-trained human eyes. The photos below show the folding screen in action. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326525" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-3.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-3.jpg 1440w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-3-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-3-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-3-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326531" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-6.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="507" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-6.jpg 1362w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-6-504x400.jpg 504w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-6-768x609.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-6-542x430.jpg 542w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-6-1200x952.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326533" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-7.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-7.jpg 1440w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-7-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-7-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-7-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The internals of the ConceptD 9 laptop are as impressive as its exterior. Acer’s review unit featured an Intel Core i9-9980HK processor, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card. The company explains the need for this high-end hardware in the product description of the laptop: “With the power to handle the most demanding creations, the ConceptD 9 is the ideal laptop for 3D design. Render large 3D models, edit and export up to 6K videos, do real-time ray tracing, and more,” states Acer. Other standout features are the choice of HDMI or DisplayPort outputs (both located on the rear of the laptop), and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity. The quality of the ConceptD 9’s display and internals are carried over into the build of the machine, and its metal body feels strong and robust. This will be comforting to users who may be concerned about pivoting their screen on a regular basis for work. Its keyboard is nicely spaced and backlit with a soft red light, while the trackpad on the right doubles as the number pad with the touch of a button. The full specifications of the PC are shown below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326521 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-1-640x355.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="355" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-1-640x355.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-1-600x333.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-1-768x426.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-1-1200x665.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-1.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326527" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-4.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-4.jpg 1440w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-4-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-4-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-4-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326529" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-5.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-5.jpg 1440w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-5-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-5-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-5-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The ConceptD CP3 monitor is made for those who create complex 3D content, said Acer. It features a 27-inch UHD (3,840 x 2,160) IPS panel with a 1ms response time and Nvidia G-Sync support. It can be overclocked to a refresh rate of 144Hz and has DisplayHDR 400 certification. The monitor is also Pantone-validated and features Delta E<1 with 90% DCI-P3 colour accuracy. This long list of specifications is attached to an adjustable stand which can take the monitor from above your eye line while at your desk, all the way to flush against its base. If the above is not enough, Acer has included additional elements in the CP3’s box which further enhance its suite of abilities. The first is a light sensor on the top of the monitor which automatically measures the ambient brightness and adjusts the backlight accordingly. The second is a set of panels which attach to the top and sides of the display and act as a light-shielding hood. Acer stated that the hood blocks ambient light and give users relief from eye strain. It also provides more privacy when working on the display. Photos of the ConceptD CP3 monitor are below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326511" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Screen-1.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="538" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Screen-1.jpg 1284w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Screen-1-476x400.jpg 476w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Screen-1-768x646.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Screen-1-511x430.jpg 511w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-Screen-1-1200x1009.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326513" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-2.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="599" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-2.jpg 1153w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-2-427x400.jpg 427w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-2-768x719.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-2-459x430.jpg 459w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-326515" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-3.jpg" alt="Acer" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-3.jpg 1440w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-3-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-3-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Acer-screen-3-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Both the laptop and monitor provided to us by Acer were top-of-the-range units, delivering the highest levels of performance for professionals. They were a pleasure to use and work on, and the only part of the review which delivered disappointing results was my 3D design skills.
