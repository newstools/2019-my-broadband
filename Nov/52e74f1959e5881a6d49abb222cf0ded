Telkom’s interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2019 showed a big decline in its fixed-broadband subscribers. While the decline is mostly a result of losing copper-based ADSL and VDSL lines, the company’s fibre growth has slowed. Instead of doubling down on its fibre network investment to remain competitive, Telkom has cut its capital expenditure on its fibre network by 36.3% over the last year. Many people saw this as Telkom admitting defeat in the fibre market, but Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko said the company is not losing the fibre war. Speaking to The Money Show’s Bruce Whitfield, Maseko said: “South Africa has 180,000km of fibre – we own 160,000km of that”.  While the statistics quoted by Maseko are dubious, it raises a good question – how much fibre does South Africa really have and what do these networks look like? The table below provides an overview of the biggest fibre networks in South Africa. It should be noted that only prominent networks who provided MyBroadband with statistics are listed below. Telkom has the largest fibre network in South Africa, with 163,800 kilometres of fibre deployed in the country. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-272499" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-fibre-map-2012.jpg" alt="Telkom fibre map 2012" width="640" height="464" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-fibre-map-2012.jpg 1485w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-fibre-map-2012-552x400.jpg 552w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-fibre-map-2012-768x556.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-fibre-map-2012-593x430.jpg 593w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Telkom-fibre-map-2012-1200x869.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Liquid Telecom South Africa, which is part of the leading pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom, has 21,000km of fibre in South Africa. “We recently announced the replacement of our Core network in South Africa which boasts of a 99.999% uptime. This was in response to the customer demand for extra bandwidth and need for improved reliability,” said Liquid Telecom South Africa CEO Reshaad Sha. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-328291" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Liquid-Telecom.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="813" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Liquid-Telecom.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Liquid-Telecom-315x400.jpg 315w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Liquid-Telecom-339x430.jpg 339w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Liquid-Telecom-768x975.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MTN SA is one of the key providers of fibre, having made substantial investments not only in expanding its network but also in building its own transmission capabilities. MTN has over 21,000km of access and national long-distance fibre that connects major cities across the country. “This figure will increase as we are continuously deploying thousands of kilometers of fibre on an annual basis,” MTN said. MTN added that it is important to note that other operators count their kilometres in terms of cables in the ground, whereas MTN counts trenched routes and not cable distances. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-328295" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-NLD-network.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="444" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-NLD-network.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-NLD-network-577x400.jpg 577w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-NLD-network-620x430.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-328297" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-FTTB.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-FTTB.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MTN-FTTB-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Broadband Infraco’s fibre network covers all nine provinces and most major cities and towns. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-328305" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Broadband-Infraco-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="450" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Broadband-Infraco-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Broadband-Infraco-2-569x400.jpg 569w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Broadband-Infraco-2-612x430.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Dark Fibre Africa has around 13,000km of fibre in the ground.
