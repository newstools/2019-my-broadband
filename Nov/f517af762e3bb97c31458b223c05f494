Afrihost has launched new fixed-LTE packages which will run on MTN’s network. Called Afrihost Pure LTE, the ISP is offering one month of free usage, and SIM-only and SIM + device packages, to clients. “Afrihost’s Pure LTE will offer users speeds of up to 150Mbps… starting from as little as R199 per month,” said Afrihost. Night Time data will be available from midnight to 06:00, and all data will roll over for 30 days, said Afrihost. Data top-ups are also available from the ISP, and range from R10 per GB to R6 per GB – depending on the size of the top-up purchased. Users must note that Pure LTE products are locked to a single location which is specified by the client on signup. Service is only available using compatible LTE devices, as specified by Afrihost, said the ISP. The tables below detail the prices of the packages.
