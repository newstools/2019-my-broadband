MTN announced earlier this year that it would launch a budget Android smartphone in a number of its African markets, including South Africa. Speaking at MTN’s interim results presentation, MTN group CEO Rob Shuter said the device would be priced at $20. “We will be launching a low-cost Android smartphone built by Mobicel in the next quarter,” Shuter said at the time. Previously, MTN’s budget Android smartphone was running on MTN’s network in a trial phase, but the device is now available across South Africa. Named the Mobicel Rio, the handset is priced at R399 and is available from all MTN’s retail stores nationwide. The Mobicel Rio features a 4-inch LCD touch screen along with front and rear cameras. The device has 8GB of internal storage and 512MB of RAM, and is powered by a quad-core 1.3GHz processor. It also includes a 1,550mAh battery and runs the Android Go operating system, which means its applications and software are optimised for its relatively low amount of storage and memory. The smartphone offers 3G connectivity and includes both a headphone jack and a MicroUSB port for audio and charging. Below are the specifications of the Mobicel Rio, according to information provided by MTN. In its latest deals catalogue, MTN offers the Mobicel Rio on prepaid for R399. This deal includes 1GB of WhatsApp data every month for three months, as well as 100MB of Anytime data every month for six months.
