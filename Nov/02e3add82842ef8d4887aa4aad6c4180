Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi has revealed the Mi CC9 Pro smartphone, which features a penta-lens rear camera system with a 108-megapixel camera. The smartphone will be known as the Mi Note 10 outside of China, where it launches on 6 November. The camera’s ultra-high resolution sensor was developed in collaboration with Samsung. The rear camera system also features four additional lenses, including a 20-megapixel ultra-wide lens, 5- and 12-megapixel telephoto lenses, and a 2-megapixel macro sensor. The front camera sports a 32MP sensor. Another impressive component is the phone’s 5,260mAh battery, which Xiaomi says can charge to full capacity in an hour. For the display, Xiaomi has employed a 6.47-inch curved 1,080 x 2,340 AMOLED screen. A Snapdragon 730G chip powers the smartphone, paired with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. The 6GB version of the device will go on sale in China for 2,799 yuan (R5,900), while the 8GB edition will cost 3,099 yuan (R7,380).
