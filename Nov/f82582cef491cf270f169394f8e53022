Pick n Pay has launched its second weekly Black November deals for its online customers in Gauteng and the Western Cape. The Black November deals form part of Pick n Pay’s 2019 Black Friday campaign, with new deals going live every Monday at 07:00. These Black November deals offer discounts of up to 50% across various categories and are valid for seven days or until stocks last. Pick n Pay’s retail executive for marketing John Bradshaw said their weekly online Black Friday deals last year proved very popular. “Many customers signed up for our Black Friday emailer ahead of the time and logged onto the website minutes before new deals launched,” Bradshaw said. “Customers really enjoyed the opportunity to shop for different products throughout the month and not just on one day.” Bradshaw said they have put extra measures in place this year to serve as many customers as quickly as possible. “We’ve enhanced our online shopping experience to make it easier for customers to find the deals they are after,” he said. Pick n Pay’s online delivery capacity has also been ramped up to avoid any delays in customers getting their items. “Black November saver delivery” slots are now available at a discounted rate, where the customer’s order will be delivered during the day on their selected date. Should customers prefer to know when their order will arrive, they can select from the typical morning or afternoon delivery slots. Here are the latest Pick n Pay Black November deals. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327033" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JVC.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JVC.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JVC-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327035" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hisense.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hisense.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hisense-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327039" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mellerware.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mellerware.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mellerware-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327043" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nestle.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nestle.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nestle-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327047" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ariel.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ariel.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ariel-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327049" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Colgate.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Colgate.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Colgate-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327051" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Simonsig.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Simonsig.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Simonsig-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
