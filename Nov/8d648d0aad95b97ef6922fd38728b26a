FlySafair has launched a sale in celebration of the Springboks winning the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The sale will last for 80 minutes (from 13:00 until 14:20) on Monday 4 November and will offer a 50% discount on all flights between 16-29 January next year. Users can book flights for this period through the FlySafair website. Some customers have reported issues with loading the website and completing the booking process due to the influx of visitors after the promotion was announced. The website and booking pages were loading correctly at the time of writing. The offer excludes group bookings of 15 or more people and is available on approximately 170,000 seats. FlySafair added that the 50% discount will be applied to the airfare before any airport taxes or extras are added to the purchase, and airport taxes and extras will not be discounted by 50%. “When various people are viewing the same flight online at the same time, the first person to successfully complete their payment will be allocated that fare,” the company said. “This could result in the runner up being required to start booking again at a now potentially higher fare.” All sales are final, and a successful booking is guaranteed by FlySafair once payment has been completed.
