The world’s leading startup and tech event Slush is just around the corner, and will take place in Helsinki, Finland on 21-22 November. The event brings together 25,000 curious minds, including 4,000 startups and 2,000 investors, at the Helsinki Expo and Convention Centre – with the aim of building a worldwide startup community. Slush is a student-driven, not-for-profit movement which is organised by over 2,000 volunteers and was founded to change attitudes toward entrepreneurship. Today, it provides delegates with the ideal platform to meet and discuss opportunities through events such as matchmaking, pitching competitions, and exhibitions. The line-up for the two-day event includes highly-acclaimed speakers from companies such as Stripe, Giphy, and Masterclass who are experts in their fields. According to Slush, what started as a gathering of 300 local founders in 2008 has become a community of truly global magnitude. The mission of Slush remains the same, however: to create and help catapult the next generation of ground-breaking entrepreneurs. Slush also hosts smaller gatherings from Singapore to New York, and other large events in Finland, Japan, and China – all in the name of uniting tech communities to solve the most meaningful problems of our time. With only two days to go until the main event, investors and start-ups from all over the world – including from Southern Africa – have already started connecting through side events which have been organised for the week leading up to Slush.
