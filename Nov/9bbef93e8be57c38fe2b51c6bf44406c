Swedish researchers have developed a new molecule which can capture and hold solar energy for decades, Bloomberg Businessweek reported. The invention could be used for a variety of applications, including the heating of buildings, vehicles, and even clothes. The liquid molecule, which consists of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, absorbs and traps energy from rays of sunlight. A catalyst is then used to release the energy as heat. The scientists also developed a storage unit to retain the charge, which they say will last decades, rather than the typical 10-year life span of todayâ€™s lithium-ion batteries. To make the application of the molecule practical, the researchers created a transparent coating that can be layered onto windows, roofs, cars, and clothing. This laminate could reduce the electricity required to heat buildings, cars, and even people. The decade-long research project cost $2.5 million and was conducted by a team led by professor of chemistry and chemical engineering, Kasper Moth-Poulsen. His group is one of 15 similar initiatives that are focused on molecular thermal solar systems. Moth-Poulsen is currently seeking investment for a planned company that will further develop the technology. With another $5 million of funding the coating will be commercially available in three years, while the storage solution could come to market in six years. Whether the system could be used to generate electricity is not yet clear, but Moth-Poulsen said the potential exists.
