Google South Africa announced the launch of Free Wi-Fi for the Cape Flats in the Western Cape through its Google Station programme. Speaking at the company’s first Google for South Africa event in Johannesburg, Google Africa director Nitin Gajria said that the company would provide fast, free, and open Wi-Fi to the area in partnership with ISP Think WiFi. “Think WiFi are passionate about providing fast, free, reliable, uncapped WiFi in underserved communities – giving people access to more on-line resources and more opportunities,” Gajria said. “Through our partnership, Think WiFi and Google will provide unlimited Wi-Fi access to communities in townships, public areas, universities, transportation hubs and shopping malls, laying the foundations for broad-based, inclusive participation in the benefits industry 4.0 brings,” Think WiFi CEO Janine Rebelo added. Google also said that it would invest $1 million to support the economic empowerment of girls and women in South Africa as part of its five-year commitment to non-profits and social enterprises. The company announced updates to the Google Go app, an optimised search application that caters to low-RAM smartphones and unstable network connections. These updates include the addition of the Discover feed, Google Assistant integration, and a “read-out-loud” feature. Google also announced it is bringing the Cameos selfie video app to South Africa. “Every day, people in South Africa and around the world turn to Google for help,” Gajria said. “We hope that the products and updates we’re announcing today will make Google even more helpful for getting things done.”
