Google has announced it is adding 10 more games to the launch line-up of its Stadia cloud gaming service. The service was originally supposed to go live with a total of 12 games on 19 November, but the company has now moved up the availability dates of several titles to bring the total launch library size to 22 games. These include Final Fantasy XV, Metro: Exodus, Rage 2, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. Most of the added games were only expected to arrive later in 2019, while Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint was originally scheduled for 2020. Google Stadia head Phil Harrison attributed the additions to the conclusion of game testing by partner publishers. “Yes, we were perhaps a little conservative in our forecast last week and (most importantly) our partners did an awesome job getting last few kinks ironed out and through testing,” Harrison tweeted. Google Stadia is facing a number of obstacles to its mainstream adoption. The company has been criticised by various gaming publications for its small library and lack of promised launch features. Google also stands to compete against services from several other companies, including Microsoft, Steam and Nvidia. The company’s announcement comes days after Microsoft added more than 50 new titles to the preview of its own cloud gaming service, xCloud. Stadia will be available in 14 countries at launch, including the US, Canada, and the UK. Below is the revised list of titles that will be playable on Google Stadia from 19 November.
