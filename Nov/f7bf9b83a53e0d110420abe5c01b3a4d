Sentech has launched South Africa’s latest broadband service – Sentech Connect – at AfricaCom 2019 in Cape Town. Sentech CEO Mlamli Booi said the company is well positioned to implement the government’s SA Connect initiative to provide ubiquitous broadband in South Africa. According to Booi, Sentech Connect will digitise healthcare, education and government services in underserved and rural areas through fast and reliable broadband connectivity. The Sentech Connect broadband service will offer speeds between 10Mbps and 100Mbps, which will support initiatives like smart classrooms and smart cities. While Sentech did not provide detailed technical specifications for Sentech Connect, it said it “will make use of various networks ranging from broadband to ultra-narrow band”. “Sentech Connect will accelerate connecting the whole country to the high-speed communications infrastructure by 2030,” said Booi. This, he said, will place South Africa on the path of meeting the National Development Plan’s targets of creating an inclusive information society. Booi added that Sentech will “continue to leverage its infrastructure to grow both its current business and its expansion into connectivity”. He said Sentech’s infrastructure and skills make it an ideal fit to ensure South Africans get access to affordable broadband, especially in rural areas. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-327341 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sentech-Connect-Launch-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sentech-Connect-Launch-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sentech-Connect-Launch-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sentech-Connect-Launch-768x513.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sentech-Connect-Launch.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-327343 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mlamli-Booi-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mlamli-Booi-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mlamli-Booi-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mlamli-Booi-768x513.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mlamli-Booi.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
