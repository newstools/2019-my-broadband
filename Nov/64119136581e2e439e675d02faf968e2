The Department of Home Affairs stated that it is currently experiencing system downtime which has affected the issuing of smart ID cards and passports. However, all other services remain available in all Home Affairs front offices across the country and have not been affected. “A technical team is working around the clock to resolve the issue and restore all services,” the department stated. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused to citizens and clients, and remain committed to improving services we render.” The Department did not provide any information regarding the cause of the downtime. This follows after the City of Johannesburg experienced system downtime which resulted in all of its online services being taken offline. The city responded to complaints on Twitter, confirming that its systems were “temporarily down”, but no further information was provided regarding the outage. Attempts to call City of Johannesburg hotlines resulted in callers being told that the number does not exist, while attempts to access the City of Johannesburg’s website were unsuccessful. The outage left users unable to register for e-services or receive their bills, according to complaints on social media. The City of Johannesburg website remains offline at the time of writing.
