Parallel Wireless has announced that MTN will deploy its OpenRAN equipment in more than 5,000 sites across 21 countries. Previously unconnected areas will receive 2G, 3G, and 4G coverage through the partnership, Parallel Wireless said. “Our Group Technology team has been pioneering OpenRAN, concluding field trials in Zambia in 2018 and deploying commercial sites from the beginning of 2019,” said MTN Group President and CEO Rob Shuter. “We focus on creating viable new RAN solutions alongside the traditional deployments of network technology suppliers in order to accelerate the rural expansion in our markets.” Parallel Wireless said that its technology lets network operators like MTN roll out cellular services cost-effectively by shifting from hardware-based to virtualised networks. Its equipment enables software-defined networking and allows an operator to roll out separate cellular technologies on the same gear: whether 2G, 3G, or 4G. “By decoupling the programmable RAN software from the hardware and allowing it to run on general-purpose processing platforms, Parallel Wireless enables cloud-native architectures, providing greater flexibility for MTN,” said Lux Maharaj, the director for Africa sales at Parallel Wireless. “As a result, the costs associated with building 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile networks are reduced and connectivity can be brought to every single person across the African continent.”
