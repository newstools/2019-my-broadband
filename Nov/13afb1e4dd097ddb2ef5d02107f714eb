Contracts on the S&P 500 climbed after a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman said the economic superpowers had agreed to roll back tariffs in phases, potentially providing a road-map to a deal to end the trade war. Equities in Japan closed with marginal gains, while shares in Hong Kong rebounded after the news.
