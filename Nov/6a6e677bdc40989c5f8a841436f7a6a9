When it comes to affordable mid-range smartphones, the Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 and Samsung Galaxy A30s are two remarkable performers. Huawei and Samsung are constantly challenging each other for dominance in the budget and mid-range categories, resulting in a range of impressive devices from both brands. As two of the best products of this competition, the Y9 Prime and Galaxy A30s offer impressive mid-range specs at affordable prices. We compared these devices to see which offers the best value for money at a price point of around R5,000. For consistency, we used the dual-sim 128GB versions, although several other configurations are available. The Huawei Y9 Prime immediately distinguishes itself with its pop-up front camera, which extends from the top of the phone. This gives the user more real estate on the notch-less 6.59-inch 1,080 x 2,340 LCD display, resulting in a more premium aesthetic than normally seen in this category. The display on the A30s offers less screen space, but it is still large when compared with the average smartphone. It has a 6.4-inch 720 x 1,560 AMOLED screen, with a teardrop style notch for its front-facing camera. The Huawei Y9 Prime is available in black, blue, and green, and the A30s in either black, white, green, or violet. Performance-wise, the two smartphones are suitable for most users’ workloads. The Y9 Prime boasts an octa-core Kirin 710F, one of Huawei’s mid-range chips, while the A30s employs the Samsung Exynos 7904 octa-core processor. Benchmarks of the phones show that the Y9 Prime is quicker in opening apps and general interface navigation, in addition to gaming. The Y9 Prime and Galaxy A30s each boast triple-camera systems for solid everyday photography. The Y9 Prime has a 16MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, and 2MP depth sensor, while the Galaxy A30s has a combination of 25MP, 8MP, and 5MP lenses. The resolution of the lenses is higher on the A30s, but the Huawei Y9 Prime boasts better low-light performance thanks to its use of advanced AI photo technology. In terms of battery life, both handsets perform well. Each device contains a 4,000mAh battery pack, providing more than enough power for a day of typical use. A comparison by Gizguide shows that the Y9 Prime performs the best in terms of battery life, clocking just under 12 hours, while the Galaxy A30s delivers around 10 hours between charges. When it comes to biometric security, the Y9 Prime uses a rear fingerprint sensor for biometrics, while the A30s offers an in-display reader. The latter is a newer technology, and although it is impressive, it is less responsive than the capacitive sensor on the Y9 Prime. There is no doubt that both the Y9 Prime and Galaxy A30s offer powerful components for their prices. Choosing between the two may come down to a matter of taste, but it does appear that the Y9 Prime offers several advantages over the Galaxy A30s. The table below compares the specifications and pricing of the Huawei Y9 Prime to the Samsung Galaxy A30s. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330809" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-vs-Samsung-2-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-vs-Samsung-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-vs-Samsung-2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-vs-Samsung-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330765" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y-Prime_Samsung-A30s-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y-Prime_Samsung-A30s.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y-Prime_Samsung-A30s-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y-Prime_Samsung-A30s-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330767" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime-camera-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime-camera.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime-camera-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime-camera-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330761" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/A30s-camera-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/A30s-camera.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/A30s-camera-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/A30s-camera-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330769" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime_A30S_comparison_1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime_A30S_comparison_1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime_A30S_comparison_1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime_A30S_comparison_1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-330771" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime_A30S_comparison_2-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime_A30S_comparison_2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime_A30S_comparison_2-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Huawei-Y9-Prime_A30S_comparison_2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
