Vodacom has seen impressive growth for its new content platforms, which include Video Play, MyMuze, and PlayInc. Video Play is a video-on-demand streaming service available in South Africa which offers a large catalogue of content and a number of subscription and rental plans to customers. MyMuze is a music streaming application which allows customers to subscribe and access a large library of music content, while PlayInc is a mobile gaming platform which lets users download and play multiple titles while paying a single subscription. Speaking at Vodacom’s interim results presentation for the six months ended 30 September 2019, Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said that all three of these services are growing at an impressive rate. “All of these services are relatively new but are growing strongly,” he said. He added that Video Play now has 1 million customers and 14.8 million video-on-demand purchases have been made on the platform. MyMuze has seen similar growth, with 1.9 million app downloads and 5.6 million subscribers. PlayInc currently offers over 2,000 games and has 343,000 subscribers. Vodacom has also seen a major increase in data usage on its network after dropping mobile data prices, with average data usage per smart device increasing by 53.5% to 1.3GB per month. Joosub said that the reduction of data prices is part of Vodacom’s pricing transformation strategy, and the company sees significant opportunity in improving the adoption of smart devices in South Africa.
