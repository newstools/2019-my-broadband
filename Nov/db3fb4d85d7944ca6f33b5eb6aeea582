Rain announced that it has launched its intelligent 5G transport network in partnership with Huawei. “With Huawei’s E2E solutions and new products, our first 5G users can experience 5G ultra-high speed broadband service at home. Rain will further strengthen its partnership with Huawei in 5G network innovation and practice to offer a top service experience to users,” said Rain CTO Gustav Schoeman. To power this new network, Rain will be using the NetEngine 8000 M series of intelligent metro routers, which provides high-density 10GE-to-site access and 100GE uplink. They will also use a variety of other Huawei products, including Huawei’s 200G+OXC optical solution, and Huawei’s Network Cloud Engine – which enables service automation and intelligent O&M on the network. “With both parties dedicated to constructing highly efficient, stable, reliable, intelligent, and trusted 5G transport networks, the partnership between rain and Huawei is aimed at offering more optimal digitised services to the South African market,” says Leo Lu, CTO of Huawei Network Marketing and Solution Sales. Rain’s 5G network deployment in Phase 1 will cover the major regions of Johannesburg and Pretoria. However, the companies said it will be expanded to cover all major cities and towns in South Africa and provide “ultra-broadband services” for homes and enterprises.
