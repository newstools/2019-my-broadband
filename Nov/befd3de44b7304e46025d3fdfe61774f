Marketing studies have shown that blog posts present an excellent opportunity to convert readers into new leads. This can be achieved by adding a lead-generating call-to-action in every blog post, or asking users to contact the relevant company representatives if they would like to find out more about your products or services. With over 2 million readers each month, MyBroadband is the perfect platform for South African companies to promote their content and grow their reach.
