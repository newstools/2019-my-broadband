Many users in South Africa are reporting problems with Absa’s Internet banking platform. Clients have reported problems with Absa’s online banking portal on social media, stating that attempting to log in to Internet banking through the “ib.absa.co.za” website results in a notification which states that the web page is unreachable. DownDetector has shown a spike in Absa outage reports which started at around 08:00 this morning. The outage map shows that the downtime is widespread, with the majority of reports originating from populated urban areas. According to the DownDetector web page for Absa, 86% of the problem reports at the time of writing were related to the bank’s online banking service, with 11% related to mobile banking. Absa’s mobile banking app was still working at the time of publication, meaning the issue is most likely exclusive to the bank’s Internet banking platform. This follows after the South African banking industry was hit with a wave of DDoS attacks. These attacks were accompanied by a ransom note and resulted in the interruption of online, app, and mobile banking services at some banks. Absa did not immediately respond to queries regarding the Internet banking downtime. Below is a screenshot from DownDetector showing the spike in outage reports for Absa online banking. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-327225" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Problems-at-Absa-640x230.jpg" alt="Problems at Absa" width="640" height="230" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Problems-at-Absa-640x230.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Problems-at-Absa-600x216.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Problems-at-Absa-768x276.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Problems-at-Absa-1200x432.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Problems-at-Absa.jpg 1543w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
