Bidorbuy has announced its plans for this year’s Black Friday sale, with the company offering massive discounts and the opportunity for shoppers to win back the value of their shopping cart. Last year’s Black Friday sale saw Bidorbuy offer big discounts across all of its categories, with bestsellers including gaming consoles, gas stoves, colour-coordinated luggage sets, personal air-conditioners, 65-inch smart TV sets, smartphones, and hoverboards. The retailer said this year’s sale would also offer massive price cuts, with a number of tech products on special. Bidorbuy’s 2019 Black Friday deals are set to include laptops, smartphones, speaker systems, home appliances, and watches, with discounts of up to 70% or more. “Black Friday has become a global shopping event. At Bidorbuy we’re working hard to exceed the rising expectations of South Africa’s online shoppers,” said Bidorbuy CEO Craig Lubbe. “We are preparing an entire week of great Black Friday deals on a wide range of heavily discounted products.” Lubbe advised shoppers to prepare a Black Friday shopping list and a budget for their online shopping on the day. “It is a good idea to start with big-ticket items such as smart TVs, sound systems, or appliances,” he said. “These items typically have limited stock and bigger rand-value discounts than smaller products, so you’ll have more to regret if you miss out on them.” The 2019 Bidorbuy Black Friday sale will be active from 25 November until 1 December, with all deals available through the website and mobile app. This year, Bidorbuy will also offer 20 randomly-selected Black Friday shoppers the chance to win back the value of their entire Black Friday shopping cart. “As soon as Black Friday closes, there’ll be even more chances to enjoy awesome discounts with Bidorbuy’s Cyber Monday week running from 2-8 December,” the retailer stated.
