Telkom’s latest financial results show that the company has continued to cut jobs. In its results for the six months ended 30 September 2019, Telkom detailed its employees numbers – along with comparative figures from September 2018. The biggest drops were seen at BCX and the Yellow Pages. BCX’s employee numbers decreased from 7,432 in 2018 to the current 5,374. This is a decrease of over 2,000 – or 27.7%. At the Yellow Pages, staff numbers were cut in half, declining from 380 to 184. The Telkom Company was also hit by job cuts, with total employee numbers dropping from 9,952 to 9,544. This was due to a combination of the Consumer and Openserve divisions decreasing staff numbers. The only section which saw employee numbers increase was the Corporate Centre, which grew staff from 274 to 424. The table below provides a summary of Telkom’s permanent employee numbers. Telkom’s latest numbers follow a similar pattern to its annual results in recent years. In 1991, Telkom had just over 67,000 employees. This number declined to just over 60,000 employees in 1994 and then dropped more aggressively up to 2000, when it counted 49,000 employees in its ranks. The drop in employees continued over the next 10 years, and in 2010 Telkom had 23,247 staff members. As fibre competitors started to emerge from 2014 onwards and more people moved away from copper lines, more staff cuts took place.
