Intel has unveiled its new 7nm graphics card – codenamed Ponte Vecchio – which is designed for high-end computing workloads. The Ponte Vecchio uses Intel’s new Xe Graphics Architecture and is designed for applications such as HPC modelling, simulation workloads, and AI training. “Ponte Vecchio will leverage Intel’s Foveros 3D and EMIB packaging innovations and feature multiple technologies in-package, including high-bandwidth memory, Compute Express Link interconnect and other intellectual property,” said Intel. Ponte Vecchio GPUs will be used in Intel’s Aurora system at Argonne National Laboratory, which is set to launch in 2021 and will be the first exascale-class supercomputer ever. “The compute node architecture of Aurora will feature two 10nm-based Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code-named “Sapphire Rapids”) and six Ponte Vecchio GPUs,” said Intel. According to Intel, Aurora will also support over 10 petabytes of memory and over 230 petabytes of storage. Intel also offered information about its OneAPI programming model, which is designed to deliver cross-architecture performance and will be also used in the Aurora system. “OneAPI delivers a unified and open programming experience to developers on the architecture of their choice without compromising performance and eliminating the complexity of separate code bases, multiple-programming languages, and different tools and workflows,” said Intel.
