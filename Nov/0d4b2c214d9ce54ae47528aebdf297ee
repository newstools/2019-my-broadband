PhoneArena has published renders based on leaked information about the iPhone 12 which show that next year’s iPhone could include some of the biggest changes Apple has made to its smartphones in years. Rumours have indicated that the iPhone 12 could develop a “boxier” aesthetic that transitions away from softer contours – much like Apple’s newer iPad and MacBook devices. Apple is also rumoured to be considering a device that has no notch, with the smartphone sporting a larger bezel instead. The idea behind this change is that the company would make its TrueDepth Face ID camera, earpiece, and front camera small enough so that they could fit within the top bezel of the new device. Further rumours suggested that Apple may make the iPhone 12 its first smartphone to include four lenses on its rear camera. This camera system would consist of a telephoto lens, a wide lens, an ultra-wide lens, and a time-of-flight camera for depth perception. The iPhone 12’s rear camera would also use an IR sensor which emits light onto the subject, allowing the iPhone to calculate the distance between itself and the subject – ensuring a more accurate depth map. Renders of the iPhone 12 published by PhoneArena can be viewed below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326629" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-white-1-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-white-1-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-white-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-white-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-white-1-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-white-1-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-white-1.jpg 1588w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326631" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326633" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-white-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-white-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-white-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-white-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-white-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-black-white.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326635" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-camera-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-camera-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-camera-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-camera-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-camera-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-camera.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326637" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-design-display-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-design-display-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-design-display-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-design-display-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-design-display-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-design-display.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-326639" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-12-Display-Camera.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
