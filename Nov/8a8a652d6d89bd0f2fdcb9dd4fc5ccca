Privacy-focused browser Brave has officially launched its first stable release on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. The browser, which has been in beta since January 2016 and has 8.7-million monthly active users, offers users protection from third-party adverts, trackers, and autoplaying videos. “Today’s Internet is broken, and users suffer the most. They are being tracked, tagged, and exploited; this not only violates privacy, but slows down page loads, drains batteries, and makes for a miserable experience,” said Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave Software. “Brave 1.0 is the browser reimagined, transforming the Web to put users first with a private, browser-based ads and payment platform.” “With Brave, the Web can be a rewarding experience for all, without users paying with their privacy,” Eich said Brave offers several unique features that make it an interesting alternative to other popular browsers. Users can support publishers and content creators from within the browser by activating Brave Rewards and the integrated Brave wallet. This allows users to send BAT – Brave’s virtual currency – as tips to creators and publishers who post great content – either as a once-off or a monthly payment. This feature can be used on various popular websites such as The Washington Post, Wikipedia, YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, and GitHub. Brave also offers a unique blockchain-based advertising model called Brave Ads, which pays users in BAT to allow certain adverts to be served to them. BAT can be used for Brave Rewards, or they can be converted into a variety of digital assets and other currencies.
