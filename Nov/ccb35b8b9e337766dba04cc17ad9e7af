The price of premium smartphones has increased drastically in recent years, with some high-end devices now tipping the scale at over R30,000. These smartphones have a variety of impressive features and use truly cutting-edge technology. Despite the advantages of these high-end devices, I have been happily using a mid-range Huawei Y7 2019 smartphone, which retails at about R3,500. It may not be quite as feature-rich as the premium devices on the market, but it does demonstrate why modern smartphone buyers should consider mid-range smartphones if they’re not comfortable with forking out tens of thousands of rand for a new handset. The main camera for the Y7 2019 uses a dual-lens system which features a 13MP lens complemented by a 2MP depth sensor. The camera also has HDR support and an LED flash, and is able to record 1080p video at 30 frames per second. The selfie camera also supports 1080p, 30FPS video, and uses an 8MP camera. While this system may not be as impressive as the quad-lens cameras on premium devices, it has been more than sufficient for my needs – which include taking photographs for MyBroadband’s social media platforms and for my personal use. Unless you are a professional photographer – in which case you probably own a DSLR camera anyway – the Y7 2019’s camera is probably sufficient for many of your daily needs. The Y7 2019 features 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The amount of RAM has proven to be more than sufficient for everything I use my phone for – be it photography, messaging, or even playing mobile games. While the storage may appear small, the Y7 2019 supports up to 1TB microSD expandable storage which makes it easy to upgrade for a proportionally small price. The Y7 2019 boasts an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor, which keeps everything running smoothly – even during multitasking. These specifications don’t match those of premium devices, but for the average user smartphone, they are more than sufficient. The Y7 2019 sports a 6.26-inch 1,520 x 720 IPS LCD display, which is not quite as high as the 1,400p resolutions boasted by flagship devices. However, when using such a small display, this is unlikely to have a significant effect. I don’t watch much video content on my smartphone outside of short videos on social media, but when I have, I have found it to be a perfectly pleasant experience. The 80% screen-to-body ratio of the device means that the Y7 2019’s bezel is relatively small, and the device delivers an aesthetic that suggests it would cost far more than its R3,500 price tag. The Y7 2019 also offers a fingerprint sensor on the rear of the device. It appears that more smartphone users are learning, just as I have, that mid-range smartphones are the financially smart option. AppleDoctor MD Sean Joffe previously told MyBroadband that mid-tier smartphones have “massively outsold” flagship devices in South Africa. “Consumers are no longer willing to just splash out to acquire the latest and greatest, as the cost-benefit simply no longer make sense,” said Joffe. Megan Quy, marketing manager at WeFix, also said they have also seen an increase in customers interested in mid-range smartphones. “There is a new market emerging as more and more people become employed and want an efficient smartphone with good specs, but don’t wish to spend their salary on it,” said Quy. This has certainly been my experience with my trusty Y7 2019 – and I would happily recommend the device to anyone looking to purchase a great smartphone without breaking the bank. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-299386" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4.jpg" alt="Huawei Y7 2019 (4)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-299384" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-3.jpg" alt="Huawei Y7 2019 (3)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-3.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-3-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-3-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-299382" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2.jpg" alt="Huawei Y7 2019 (2)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-299380" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1.jpg" alt="Huawei Y7 2019 (1)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
