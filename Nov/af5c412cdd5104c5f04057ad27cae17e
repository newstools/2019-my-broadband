The price of petrol is expected to rise next month while other fuels drop in price, according to the Automobile Association (AA), which was commenting on unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. The Association said the underlying fundamentals have been treading water in the first half of November. This has resulted in a predicted increase of 11 cents per litre for 95 octane petrol and a 7c-per-litre increase for 93 octane petrol. The price of diesel is set to decrease by 18 cents and illuminating paraffin is expected to drop by 21 cents. “The average Rand/US dollar exchange rate has been essentially flat, contributing a small decrease of about 3.5 cents to fuel prices as it maintains a level around R14.90 to the dollar,” the AA said. “The picture for oil is similar, with the international prices of both petrol and diesel having run neck-and-neck for several days last week.” Below is a summary of the price changes expected for December 2019: This increase in the price of petrol is bad for many people who will be travelling on holiday in December, the AA said. “However, the predicted drop in the diesel price means input costs in for instance the manufacturing and agricultural sectors remains relatively untouched in relation to fuel costs, which is good news,” it added.
