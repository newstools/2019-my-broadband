Rain has unveiled its Black Friday 2019 special, where clients get a free Huawei 5G CPE worth R3,450 with a new Rain 5G subscription. This means that new Rain 5G subscribers will not pay any upfront fees when they sign up. Rain officially launched its 5G service on 11 November, offering unlimited data at speeds of up to 700Mbps at R1,000 per month. Rain’s 5G service is currently available in areas in Johannesburg and Tshwane – where it has around 250 towers – with an estimated 500,000 households in the coverage area. During 2020, Rain hopes to expand the network to Cape Town and Durban, and in due course cover all of metropolitan South Africa with 2,000 live 5G sites. There is only one product available: Rain unlimited data for R1,000 per month with a Huawei 5G CPE Pro router. The 5G special follows shortly after Rain launched an online RICA process for clients. Rain’s chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga told MyBroadband that new Rain customers can visit the company’s website and follow three easy steps to activate their SIM.
