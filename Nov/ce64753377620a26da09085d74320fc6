In South Africa’s mid-tier smartphone market, users are spoiled for choice. Both HUAWEI and Samsung offer a range of devices catering to those who require a good balance of smartphone power and price. High performance options are also available at the top end of this category for users who want to spend a bit more. HUAWEI is introducing a smartphone that could be a game-changer in this category – The nova 5T. This new smartphone sports impressive hardware and a refined, eye-catching design that is sure to be a hit with both tech-savvy and fashion-conscious smartphone users. To see how the nova 5T compares against established models, we looked at the specifications of the nova 5T, Samsung Galaxy S10e, and the Samsung Galaxy A80. The Samsung Galaxy S10e is the smallest device in this comparison and also features a smaller display than the other two phones. It boasts a 5.8-inch 1,080 x 2,280 AMOLED display with a screen-to-body ratio of 83.3%. The A80 is the largest of the three devices, with a 6.7-inch 1,080 x 2,400 AMOLED screen. The A80’s bezel is less prominent than in the S10e, with its screen-to-body ratio coming in at 85.8%. The Huawei nova 5T fits in between the two Samsung options in terms of size, with a 6.26-inch 1,080 x 2,340 LCD display. The screen-to-body ratio is measured at 91.7%, giving the nova 5T a front which is nearly completely covered by its display. The nova 5T is also the slimmest of the three devices, measuring 7.8mm thick, compared to the S10e’s 7.9mm and the A80’s 9.3mm. When it comes to processors, Samsung’s units are made using an 8nm manufacturing process. The Galaxy S10e comes with a Samsung Exynos 9820 octa-core processor, which is paired with 6GB of RAM. HUAWEI has fitted the Kirin 980 – one of its most powerful chips and the first smartphone processor to be made with a 7nm manufacturing process – in the nova 5T. Combined with 8GB of RAM, the Kirin 980 boasts smooth performance in multitasking, app navigation, social media use, and graphics-intensive mobile gaming. The Galaxy A80 then sports an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 730, and comes with 8GB of RAM. This chip is rated lower than the other two processors in this comparison but is more than capable of providing solid performance for the typical smartphone user. The Galaxy S10e sports a dual-camera on the rear of the handset, with a 12MP wide and 16MP ultrawide lens. On the front, it features a single 10MP punch-hole selfie camera. Samsung’s A80 comes with a triple camera system, featuring a 48MP main lens, 8MP wide lens, and a TOF sensor. A rotating mechanism holds the camera in place, and allows it to double as the front-facing camera too. The nova 5T features a rear quad-camera system consisting of a main 48MP lens, 16MP wide-angle lens, 2MP macro lens and 2MP bokeh lens, which is used for depth sensing. A 32MP punch-hole front camera provides excellent quality for selfies. When it comes to battery size, the nova 5T comes out on top, too. While the Galaxy S10e sports a 3,100mAh battery pack, and the Galaxy A80 offers a larger 3,700mAh unit, the nova 5T features a 3,750mAh battery. This article was published in partnership with Huawei.
