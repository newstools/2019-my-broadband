Online PC retailer Newegg has launched a Black Friday pre-sale, which is available on its South African storefront. The sale includes discounts on CPUs, graphics cards, SSDs, power supplies, cases, and more. Black Friday 2019 officially takes place on 29 November, although many retailers will open their sales on Monday, 25 November, and run them for the week. MyBroadband has been informed that this is to take advantage of the fact that payday for many people is on the 25th of the month. A selection of the deals on offer in Neweggâ€™s Black Friday pre-sale are below. Certain deals are available until Monday only. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329083" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AMD.jpg" alt="Newegg" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AMD.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AMD-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AMD-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329091" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RAM.jpg" alt="Newegg" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RAM.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RAM-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RAM-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329085" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ASUS.jpg" alt="Newegg" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ASUS.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ASUS-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ASUS-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329089" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PSU.jpg" alt="Newegg" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PSU.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PSU-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PSU-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329087" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EVGA.jpg" alt="Newegg" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EVGA.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EVGA-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EVGA-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
