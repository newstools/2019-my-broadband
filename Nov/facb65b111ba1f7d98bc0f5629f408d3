The Broadcast Research Council of South Africa (BRCSA) has released its television audience measurements for October 2019. The data includes a list of the most-watched shows on DStv, SABC 1, 2, 3, and Etv. The BRCSA said the report does not give the total viewership of DStv commercial channels, and the figures reflect viewership on the platform at the top tier. For instances where the same show appeared across multiple channels, we only included figures for the channel where it had the highest number of viewers. The table below details the most-watched shows in South Africa in October 2019. The SABC’s channels are the most popular in South Africa thanks to the widspread reach and free availability of its broadcast. The company is also looking to expand its operations into the digital streaming segment, despite its dire financial position. SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe recently said that the public broadcaster wants to migrate to digital broadcasting platforms and launch an over-the-top (OTT) streaming service. Launching into this market would naturally place it in competition with Netflix and other OTT players, including Showmax. Mxakwe acknowledged that the SABC was behind other OTT players in terms of technology, but said it does not intend to leave the streaming service market to its competitors. “The SABC has developed an integrated OTT strategy with the goal that the SABC develops or acquires its own OTT streaming platform as a medium-term goal.” “This will allow the SABC to control its own destiny into the future,” he added.
