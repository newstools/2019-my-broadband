Rain’s 4G product offering is now available for purchase on Takealot’s online store. Customers are now able to purchase a SIM from Takealot on Rain’s unlimited off-peak data offering for a once-off cost of R1 and a monthly charge of R250. This product offers South African customers 19 hours of unlimited data every day from 23:00 until 18:00 the next day, provided they are covered by the company’s 4G network. “The best way to add Rain is through a dual-SIM phone or a tablet,” Takealot said. “Dual-SIM lets you keep one SIM for your other network and then add another for your affordable Rain data.” “Many of the phones, tablets and devices on takealot.com support Rain. As long as it can hold a SIM and is able to support 4G or LTE, you’re good to go,” Takealot added. Customers can add the Rain 4G SIM to their online cart and choose between door-to-door delivery or pickup point collection. Once they have received their rain SIM card, they can activate it online on the Rain website. Takealot has partnered with Rain to offer a variety of bundle deals which include smartphones, tablets, and Wi-Fi routers, through its online store.
