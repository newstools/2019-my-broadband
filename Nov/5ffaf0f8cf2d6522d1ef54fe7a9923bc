Samsung has officially rolled out its PlayGalaxy Link app to the Galaxy Note 10. The app allows users to stream games installed on a PC to their Galaxy device via a Wi-Fi or mobile internet connection. It uses the processing power of the computer to eliminate the strain taken by components on mobile handsets to deliver high-demand titles. “Without the need for local storage or graphics performance, you get high-fidelity gaming while only using about as much battery as streaming video,” Samsung said. To reduce lag and latency, Samsung explained that the service uses a peer-to-peer connection, rather than a relay server. Additionally, PlayGalaxy Link employs “Adaptive FPS” to improve connectivity in low-quality network environments. Samsung recommends the host computer has a minimum hardware configuration of an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM and a GTX 1060 GPU. A compatible Bluetooth or wired game controller is also be required. To use the feature, users must download and install the PlayGalaxy Link app on both their Samsung Galaxy device and their computer. They can then sign into their Samsung Account on the desktop client, after which the app will search the PC for installed games. Users can also add titles manually. Once signed into their Samsung Account on the mobile app, users will be able to select their computer and connect. A beta version of PlayGalaxy Link is currently available on Galaxy S10, S10e and S10+ devices in a selection of countries including the US, UK, South Korea and Russia. The app will be coming to the Galaxy Fold, S9, S9+, Note 9, and A90 in early December.
