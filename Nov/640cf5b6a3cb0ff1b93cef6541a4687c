The Dubai Police force wants to add Tesla’s electric Cybertruck to its vehicle fleet, according to Arabian Business. The official Dubai Police Twitter account tweeted a picture of the pick-up truck with the department’s signage and the caption “2020”. Dubai’s police force already boasts an extensive line-up of supercars, including a Bugatti Veyron, Lamborghini Aventador, a Ferrari FF, and Aston Martin One-77. Earlier this week, the Dubai Police announced it would supplement this selection with a Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S. Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri said the Cybertruck would improve security at Dubai’s tourist attractions. The announcement comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed that the company had received more than 250,000 early deposits for the futuristic-looking vehicle. The Cybertruck’s unveiling drew significant interest, both for the vehicle’s otherworldly design and impressive features, as well as a now-infamous mishap during a demonstration of its “bulletproof” windows. The vehicle will be commercially available in 2021, starting at a price of $39,900. Tesla has said that it wants to use the Cybertruck to take on the Ford F-150’s dominance in the US pick-up truck market. The latter company is also planning to introduce an electric version of its popular F-150 pickup in 2021. شرطة دبي – 2020 – Dubai Police #CyberTruck pic.twitter.com/V9rMPLgjS4 — Dubai Policeشرطة دبي (@DubaiPoliceHQ) November 26, 2019
