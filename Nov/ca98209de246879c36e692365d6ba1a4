Africa Data Centres has partnered with INX-ZA to offer free Internet peering through the Johannesburg Internet Exchange (JINX) and Cape Town Internet Exchange (CINX). As part of this partnership, Africa Data Centres will subsidise the port and cross-connect fee for any customer collocating in their Africa Data Centres to JINX or CINX. According to Africa Data Centres CEO Stephane Duproz, connecting to JINX and CINX enables carriers, ISPs, and enterprises to peer in a free and simplified manner. “Africa Data Centres’ customers will still deal with INX-ZA on a technical level, and community level, and we will be the catalyst that enables this,” said Duproz. Duproz confirmed that customers will still be able to apply to INX-ZA for ports in the same way as before. “Africa Data Centres will cover the costs of ports and cross-connects but the customer will maintain the technical relationship with INX-ZA directly,” Duproz said. The company currently hosts a JINX node in its Johannesburg Data Centre, and a CINX node in its Cape Town Data Centre. “We have long supported INX-ZA and their model of community-run, distributed IXPs, by playing host to them in JNB and CPT,” said Duproz. “This next step is the logical one in progressing that relationship.”
