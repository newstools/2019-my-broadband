Telkom is currently shutting down its copper network, which means that all traditional phone lines and ADSL services will be discontinued. This will leave thousands of South African businesses without Internet connectivity and phone lines, which will force them to look for alternative solutions. Good news is that Connection Telecom is offering businesses an excellent alternative to Telkom’s phone lines and ADSL services. Connection Telecom is well-known for its high-quality voice products for businesses, which include its cloud PBX service. This service offers companies a great voice solution for R79 per user per month. A big benefit of the cloud PBX service is that it works over most Internet connections, including fibre, LTE, and microwave connections. A company can therefore easily replace their existing Telkom phone lines and PBX with Connection Telecom’s cloud PBX service – and save money in the process.
