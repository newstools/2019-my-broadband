Windows 10’s November update, also known as Version 1909, has begun rolling out, offering a variety of new features and performance improvements. The update will be less intensive to install than previous feature updates, said Windows, because Microsoft will be reusing servicing technology for customers who have previously installed its May 2019 update. One of the more notable changes in this update is the addition of a feature which allows users to create new events directly from Windows 10’s built-in calendar feature. To use this feature, simply open the calendar, click on the correct date, and begin typing in the text box that will appear. Users will also be able to configure and turn off notifications from specific apps or websites directly through a notification that appears – be it as a banner or within the Action Centre. The search box in File Explorer will now be powered by Windows Search. According to Microsoft, this will enable users to integrate their OneDrive content with the results they would usually receive from a traditional File Explorer search. Microsoft also said that the Windows 10 November Update will offer improved battery life and power efficiency to users with certain processors. Microsoft did not disclose which processors are affected by this update.
