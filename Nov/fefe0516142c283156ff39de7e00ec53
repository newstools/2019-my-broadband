Valve could be working on a cloud gaming service for Steam, according to code uncovered on one of the company’s websites. Steam DB, a third-party organisation which monitors developments around Steam’s applications and packages, discovered code with the term “Steam Cloud Gaming” on Valve’s website for partners. The code includes a line for an alert dialog which reads “‘You must agree to the terms in the Steam Cloud Gaming Addendum before continuing”, and another which states “Thank you for signing the latest Steam Cloud Gaming Addendum”. Although this does not serve as an official confirmation of the Steam Cloud Gaming platform, the move could make sense given the trend of the creation of similar services from other publishers. Microsoft’s Project xCloud game streaming service is currently in public preview, while Google’s Stadia platform is set to launch on 19 November. Steam already offers features such as Steam Remote Play and Steam Link, which allows users to stream games to their devices via the Internet from their PC. Unlike cloud gaming services, however, these features still need a local copy of the game on the hosting PC, which also needs to run the required hardware. The term “Steam Cloud Gaming” could simply refer to a renamed term for the existing streaming options, but The Verge pointed out that a simple rebrand would likely not require partners to sign updated agreements with Valve.
