Standard Bank is seeing a month-on-month increase of 70,000 customers for its Instant Money service. Instant Money is a service provided by Standard Bank which allows users to send cash to anyone in South Africa who has a cellphone number. A PIN-controlled cardless collection system allows recipients to claim their money at ATMs or select retail partners of Standard Bank. “We are finding that Instant Money is particularly popular with people living in cities who wish to transfer money to family members in rural areas,” said Nelisa Zulu, Standard Bank Head of Merchant Solutions. “Money can be sent and collected at Standard Bank ATMs or other designated collection points within most communities. This makes it more convenient than other forms of payment in the country, which take time to be complete.” Zulu said that Standard Bank has also seen a significant increase in the use of Instant Money for businesses, with annual growth in excess of 100%. “Recipients don’t need a bank account and can collect their funds at a date and time of their convenience. We have examples where businesses had payment challenges and, at short notice, had to pay more than 2 000 employees. Instant Money Bulk payments were utilised to facilitate this transfer of funds.”
