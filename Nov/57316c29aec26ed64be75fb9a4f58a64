Samsung’s next-generation of flagship smartphones will sport larger screens and 108MP camera systems, according to several reports. Tech leaker Evan Blass (@evleaks) has said that next year’s Samsung Galaxy S11 will come in three variants with screen sizes measuring 6.4 inches, 6.7 inches, and 6.9 inches. This is a significant increase over the 5.8 inches of the Galaxy S10e, as well as the 6.1 inches and 6.4 inches of the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus. All three models will feature curved edge-to-edge displays. Blass stated that the two smaller iterations will be available in 4G and 5G versions, while the S11 Plus will only be available with 5G. In addition to the rumoured new screen sizes, XDA Developers discovered code in the latest beta version of Samsung’s camera app which mentions a 108MP camera system. The code indicates a new supported resolution of 12,000 x 9,000 pixels, which totals 108 million pixels (megapixels). Samsung currently manufactures the ISOCELL Bright HMX 108MP camera sensor for Xiaomi’s Mi Mix Alpha and Mi Note 10. It has not been confirmed which future Samsung smartphone will feature the new camera. Previous reports suggested that the Samsung Galaxy S11 range would launch in February 2020.
