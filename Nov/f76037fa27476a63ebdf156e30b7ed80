Microsoft plans to launch its Project xCloud game streaming service next year, according to The Verge. In an interview with the publication, Microsoft’s head of gaming Phil Spencer said he expects xCloud to be “generally available” in 2020. The company plans to integrate the service with its subscription offering, Xbox Game Pass. This means xCloud will allow gamers to stream games that form part of the Xbox Game Pass library from the cloud to a range of devices, including Android-based smartphones and tablets. Microsoft will add support for streaming on Windows 10 PCs next year and is currently also trialling xCloud on iOS devices. In addition to the reveal of its launch window, Microsoft added 50 more titles to the beta version of the service yesterday. The preview was originally launched on 14 October, with five games available to play for testers in the US, UK, and South Korea. New titles now include Devil May Cry 5, Tekken 7, Forza Horizon 4, Crackdown 3 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Microsoft will also roll out the beta to Canada, India, Japan, and Western Europe in 2020. The announcement comes days before Google is due to launch its cloud game streaming service Stadia. That service will have 12 titles available at launch, with 14 more arriving in 2019. Together with future launches, this puts Stadia’s library at 44 games. Various publications have reported that Google may struggle to build the type of catalogue that streaming rivals like Microsoft and Valve could offer.
