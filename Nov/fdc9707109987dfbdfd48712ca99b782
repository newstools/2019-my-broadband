Smartphone cameras have become so advanced that they can replace DSLR cameras in many situations, offering everything from impressive optical zoom to great colour ranges and HDR capabilities. Manufacturers are constantly working to improve their handset’s camera offerings, and it has now become common to see high megapixel counts and 3D depth-sensing features on flagship devices. This variety of camera specifications can make it difficult to determine which device has the best-quality image sensor, however. This is why smartphone manufacturers commonly cite review score figures from DxOMark, which scores smartphone cameras according to their performance using a rigorous and specialised testing process. The DxOMark camera score is one of the best indicators of a smartphone camera’s performance and is employed across the industry to compare the quality of mobile camera systems. We have listed the top 10 smartphone camera systems in the world below, using data for devices which have been reviewed by DxOMark at the time of writing. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-301278" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-periscope-telephoto.jpg" alt="Huawei periscope telephoto" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-periscope-telephoto.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-periscope-telephoto-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-periscope-telephoto-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> From the rankings above, it is clear that Huawei dominates the market in terms of smartphone camera performance, especially considering it also owns the Honor brand. This is due to a number of factors, with the company citing the much larger size of its camera sensor compared to the competition, as well as its intelligent AI features as contributors to the high quality of its photos. Huawei has also enjoyed a partnership with Leica for many years, which has allowed it to implement superior-quality lenses on its smartphones. The Mate 30 Pro and the P30 Pro, Huawei’s latest premium and flagship smartphones, both boast cutting-edge camera features. The Huawei P30 Pro boasts up to 50x digital zoom thanks to its impressive periscope lens design, while the Mate 30 Pro has a quad-lens camera and a massive 1/1.54-inch sensor for pictures that deliver unprecedented colour accuracy and quality. In addition to the best cameras on the market, these smartphones also sport powerful chipsets, impressive battery life, large amounts of storage and RAM, and great connectivity features.
