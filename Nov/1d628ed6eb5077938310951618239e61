Facebook has told TechCrunch that it is rolling out a new feature for its mobile apps that will let users remove certain tabs or stop them from displaying their red notification dot. “We are rolling out navigation bar controls to make it easier for people to connect with the things they like and control the notifications they get within the Facebook app,” said Facebook. Facebook said that most iOS users will already have access to this new feature, while Android devices can expect to receive it in the next few weeks. To edit your shortcut bar settings, you can press and hold on any of the shortcuts in the navigation bar. This will provide two options – remove the tab, or disable notifications for the tab. Alternatively, users can navigate to More > Settings and Privacy > Settings > Shortcuts, which allows users to turn any of the Marketplace, Groups, Events, and Pages tabs on or off. In addition to these notification changes, Facebook announced in October that it would be testing a new News tab on its mobile app. “News gives people more control over the stories they see, and the ability to explore a wider range of their news interests, directly within the Facebook app,” said Facebook. “It also highlights the most relevant national stories of the day.” Those with access to this News tab will still receive news on their feeds as usual.
