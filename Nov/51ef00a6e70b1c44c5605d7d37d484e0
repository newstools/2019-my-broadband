The first episode of Amazon’s upcoming The Lord of the Rings TV series is yet to air, but plans are already in motion for its second season. According to Deadline, Amazon Studios has officially given the green light for season 2 of the show. Although the company acquired worldwide television rights for a multi-season LOTR series back in 2017, it still needs to approve every new season of the show before production can take place. According to the report, Amazon’s plan is to film the first two episodes of the first season and then take a break in production to finish the writing for the second season. Deadline said this approach is well-known for straight-to-series orders, as it helps the producers to assess the first material and make well-informed adjustments for future episodes if required. It could also make it easier to film parts of the second season in conjunction with the second batch of episodes from season one. J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay will act as executive producers on the project. The pair were working on Star Trek 4 with JJ Abrams before it was cancelled. Writers for the show include Gennifer Hutchison (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul), Helen Shang (13 Reasons Why, Hannibal), Jason Cahill (The Sopranos), and Justin Doble (Stranger Things). The series is expected to be set during the Second Age of Middle-Earth, before the events of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Production will take place in the United States and New Zealand, where Peter Jackson’s original films were filmed. Amazon has not announced an official release date for the TV show.
