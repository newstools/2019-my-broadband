Vodacom has published its interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2019, showing impressive subscriber growth over the period. The network added 691,000 mobile subscribers over the period, bringing its total South African user base up to 43.9 million. “Ongoing initiatives to enhance customer experience through pricing transformation, modernisation of IT systems and sustained investment in network infrastructure, continue to pay dividends,” said Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub. “This is evidenced by the additional 691,000 customers who joined Vodacom in the period. There are now 43.9 million customers connected through South Africa’s leading network each enjoying access to a wide array of financial and digital services.” Joosub added that the company remains focused on participation in South Africa’s regulatory process to assign available high-demand spectrum. “While we have made significant progress in our pricing transformation journey, spectrum availability is a key lever to accelerating data price declines,” he said. Vodacom’s South African service revenue increased 0.3% over the six months, with contract and prepaid customer revenue declining by 2.5% and 2.1% respectively. The decline in prepaid customer revenue was attributed to a 60% decline in out-of-bundle data revenue. Vodacom also saw impressive data growth in South Africa, with traffic increasing by 54.6% over the period, with data bundle purchases increasing by 7.9% to 472 million. The company’s fibre roll-out is progressing well, with the number of homes connected increasing by 120.9% to 43,000 over the past six months.
