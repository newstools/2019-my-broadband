The United States Department of Commerce has given Huawei another temporary license to operate in the US. According to a statement released by the Department of Commerce, the decision will authorise “specific, limited engagements in transactions involving the export, re-export, and transfer of items to Huawei and its non-U.S. affiliates which are subject to the Entity List”. According to US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, the decision was made primarily to help citizens in remote areas of the US. “The Temporary General License extension will allow carriers to continue to service customers in some of the most remote areas of the United States who would otherwise be left in the dark,” said  Ross. “The Department will continue to rigorously monitor sensitive technology exports to ensure that our innovations are not harnessed by those who would threaten our national security.” Huawei was added to the US Entity List after the US claimed that the company was engaged in activities that were “contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests.” However, Ross has recently expressed optimism that the US would reach a “phase one” trade deal with China this month and claimed that licenses which allow US companies to trade with Huawei would be coming “very shortly”.
