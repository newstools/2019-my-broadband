Checkers has launched a one-hour grocery delivery service named Sixty60, which is available in select locations in Sandton, Johannesburg, and Cape Town. The company said the service is South Africa’s first 60-minute grocery delivery offering from a supermarket chain. This platform is available through the Sixty60 app, which allows shoppers to order groceries and drinks at the touch of a button. Using the app, customers can track the status of their order and delivery in real-time. Checkers said that the prices for products on the Sixty60 app offer “the same value for money for which Checkers is renowned”. “Sixty60 will offer unrivalled convenience because it does all the hard work for you,” said Shoprite Checkers chief on innovation and strategy Neil Schreuder. “In our time-pressed society, providing consumers with a swift, on-demand grocery delivery service is like giving them back time: today’s most precious commodity.” Checkers has been testing the Sixty60 service with its own employees for months and has now made the offering available to the public in selected locations. Products on the Sixty60 app are priced the same as products found in Checkers stores, and delivery is completely free for the time being during the pilot period. Below are the locations which are supported by Sixty60 during the trial period. Sandton Cape Town “The name Sixty60 captures the service’s main ambition: for customers to order groceries in sixty seconds and have them delivered in as little as sixty minutes,” Schreuder said. The beta version of the Sixty60 app is available for download from the Google Play Store and App Store.
