Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has provided new predictions for the upcoming Apple Watch 6, MacRumours reported. Kuo believes that the key selling points of the new smartwatch will include water resistance, faster speeds, and better wireless connectivity. This will all reportedly be achievable due to Apple switching to a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) for use within the Apple Watch 6’s circuit boards. This LCP material will replace the polyimide used in the Apple Watch 5. It is also believed that the Apple Watch 6 could sport a new chip due to the chipset in the Watch 5 being similar to the one used in the Watch 4 with a few minor upgrades. The Apple Watch already offers water resistance up to 50 metres underwater, so improvements to the watch’s water resistance could mean that the 2020 Apple Watch will be wearable while scuba diving or water skiing. Gartner has predicted that worldwide end-user spending on smartwatches will see an increase of 34% in 2020, with shipments increasing to 86 million for the same year. “More users coming into the smartwatch segment are replacing wristbands with smartwatches,” said Ranjit Atwal, senior research director at Gartner. Atwal also said that Gartner expects the average selling prices of smartwatches to decline 4.5% between 2020 and 2021.
