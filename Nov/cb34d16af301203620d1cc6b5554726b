BMW has revealed photos of its i4 electric vehicle, a new sedan which is set to arrive in 2021. The pictures were revealed at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show and feature the camouflaged i4 during testing in snowy winter conditions in Sweden, with a design similar to the current BMW 3-series. The German automaker claims that the i4 can reach up to 600 kilometres of range from a single charge on its 80kWh battery pack. By comparison, Tesla recently managed to reach that mileage on a 100kWh battery. BMW said the i4’s electric powertrain employs the fifth generation of BMW’s eDrive system, which includes a high-voltage battery configuration like Porsche’s Taycan. The i4’s 390kW electric motor supposedly puts out 523 brake horsepower, allowing the car to go from 0-100 km/h in four seconds. This gives the car a performance output that mirrors BMW’s current V8 engines. The BMW i4 will be the third car in BMW’s electric line-up. The i3 hatchback has been the lone electric-only BMW model since 2013, while the electric variant of the X3 SUV is due to launch in 2020. BMW plans to expand its electric offering with up to five dedicated i-series vehicles by the end of 2021. By 2025, it endeavours to have 12 electric cars across the entire BMW Group, which also includes Mini and Rolls-Royce. <img class="size-large wp-image-328221 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb16996-640x424.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb16996-640x424.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb16996-600x397.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb16996-768x509.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb16996.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-328225 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17003-640x424.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17003-640x424.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17003-600x397.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17003-768x509.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17003.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-328227 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17007-640x424.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17007-640x424.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17007-600x397.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17007-768x509.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sb17007.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
