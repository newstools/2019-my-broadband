WhatsApp has launched its latest beta update which adds numerous new emojis, WABetaInfo reports. This beta version of the popular messaging service is available through the Google Play Beta Programme, which is currently not accepting new users. These new emojis support the latest Unicode standard and span various categories. New emojis include a yawning face, people using wheelchairs and walking sticks, and various new images of people holding hands. The new beta version of WhatsApp also includes several new food emojis, including garlic, waffles, and an onion. A full list of the new emojis can be found on the WABetaInfo website. WhatsApp is believed to be working on various big changes to its messaging platform in the coming months. One of the most requested features is a dark mode, which the messaging platform has already begun testing on Android and iOS. WhatsApp is also expected to add a “disappearing message” feature, which will allow senders to send messages that automatically delete themselves after a pre-defined period of time. Reference to an upcoming Facebook Pay feature has also been discovered in WhatsApp’s source code. It is unclear whether this feature would be integrated with Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency platform.
