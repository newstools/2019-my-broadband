Google launched its new Play Points rewards programme in the United States this week. The feature has been available in Japan since September 2018 and was introduced to South Korean users in April this year. Play Points lets Android smartphone users earn rewards by buying and downloading apps from the Google Play Store. Subscriptions also earn customers rewards points. These points can be redeemed for credit in the Google Play Store or used for in-app purchases. Users can also donate their points to a selection of non-profit organisations, including Doctors Without Borders USA and the World Food Program USA. The system includes four reward tiers that offer different perks. Each tier offers increased points earnings for every dollar a user spends. The bottom Bronze tier rewards users with 1 point for every dollar spent, while the top Platinum tiers gives 1.4 points per dollar. Users will have to spend a certain amount to stay within a particular tier. The program is free to join via a simple sign-up process within the Play Store app. Google has not revealed plans for the rollout of Play Points in South Africa and other countries.
