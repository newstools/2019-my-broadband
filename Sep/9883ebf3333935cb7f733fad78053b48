The 2019 MyBroadband Conference and Expo will take place on 17 October 2019 at the Gallagher Convention Centre and is set to be the best-ever IT and telecoms conference in South Africa. Now in its fifteenth year, the annual MyBroadband Conference is the premier ICT event in South Africa and the meeting place for the country’s IT and telecoms community. This year South Africa’s top telecoms and IT companies have partnered with MyBroadband to showcase their products and services – and interact with local IT decision-makers.

Other prominent sponsors include Vodacom, WIOCC, SqwidNet, Miro, Nology, Scoop, Nashua, TOA Cable, CBI Electric, Codehesion, Cipherwave, and Home-Connect.

It is well known that IT executives and business owners attend the conference to see what is on offer and make purchasing decisions based on this information. All conference delegates also receive a voucher booklet from exhibitors with special deals on telecommunications and IT products for the business market. Registrations for the 2019 MyBroadband Conference are open, with a big special on early-bird tickets. It should be noted that only 40 of these special tickets are available. The tickets cover all aspects of the event, including access to the expo and conference, lunch, and refreshments.
