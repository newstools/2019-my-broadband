Hlaudi Motsoeneng has demanded that the SABC pay him R16 million, which he said he is owed by the broadcaster. Motsoeneng, the former COO of the SABC, made the claim as part of a legal dispute with the Special Investigating Unit, reported the Sunday Times. The report stated that the unit has lodged a civil claim against Motsoeneng for R21 million – in a bid to recoup money which he received for brokering a content deal between the SABC and MultiChoice. Motsoeneng’s demand for R16 million is a counterclaim to this, and is aimed at the SABC. Motsoeneng was paid a “success fee” of R11.5 million by the SABC board for setting up the deal with MultiChoice in 2016, which allowed it to broadcast SABC archive footage on DStv. The deal was immediately called into question by stakeholders and challenged by Motsoeneng’s opponents. The balance of the money the Special Investigating Unit is pursuing – R10.2 million – is for irregular appointments, salary increases, and unlawful dismissals by Motsoeneng when he was COO. Motsoeneng said the R16 million he demanded is due to the benefits the SABC received following the conclusion of the content deal. Motsoeneng was removed from the SABC in September 2018, when the CCMA dismissed his bid to get his job back at the state broadcaster. Motsoeneng was initially dismissed from the SABC in 2017 for bringing the organisation into disrepute and causing irreparable damage to his employer. This followed a press briefing on 19 April 2017, where Motsoeneng defended his “90% local” policy which he implemented at the SABC. In this latest battle, Motsoeneng has denied any wrongdoing and has filed a counterclaim in the high court in Johannesburg, stated the report. He said he is entitled to “outstanding compensation for his business innovation and for raising capital for the SABC”. Motsoeneng told the Sunday Times he would not comment further as the matter is before court.
