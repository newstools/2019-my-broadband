Showmax told MyBroadband that mobile viewing has drastically increased in popularity on its platform. In contrast, viewership on bigger displays such as TVs and computers has decreased in popularity. According to Showmax, “leanback” viewing – which includes the use of smart TVs, gaming consoles, and the DStv Explora – is Showmax’s largest viewing segment, accounting for 40% of all viewing hours. However, the company said this figure has decreased over the past two years from 45%. “Within leanback viewing, we’ve seen a significant gain in smart TV’s share of the total – which I think makes sense given the proliferation of increasingly affordable smart TVs,” added Showmax. This decrease in the popularity of leanback viewing naturally means that other segments have gained an increased viewing share. However, web viewing – watching on a device such as a desktop PC or laptop – has not benefited from the decline of leanback viewing. Instead, Showmax said web viewing has also decreased – from 25% two years ago to about 20% today. Mobile viewing has been the biggest winner over the past two years, increasing from about 30% viewing share two years ago, to just under 40% this year. Showmax believes that this is an unsurprising development due to a number of advancements in the mobile viewing experience. These improvements include more affordable handsets, more extensive Wi-Fi access, and cheaper mobile data, Showmax said. Showmax also highlighted that Android viewership has seen a massive boost in the past two years compared to iOS. While the two were neck-and-neck two years ago, the split between Android and iOS viewing is now about 70-30 in favour of Android.
