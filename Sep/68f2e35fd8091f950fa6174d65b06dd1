The South African Police Service (SAPS) is set to launch a new app which citizens can use to fight crime. MyBroadband found the application – called My SAPS – on the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store. Vodacom is listed as the app’s developer. A description on the App Store describes My SAPS as providing “a new and easy way for citizens to access police services and information, as well as enabling everyone to contribute towards building a crime-free society”. The app’s features include: According to a source who spoke to MyBroadband, the SAPS Technology Management Services Division is testing the app’s readiness and has asked its employees to download and trial the application. The source added that the app is set to officially launch on 11 October 2019. The ability to submit a tip-off will reportedly also be available through USSD, by dialling *134*101111#. It must be noted that although the app is available for download, its functionality is currently limited and it is not advisable to report crimes on the platform until the official launch. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320343" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SAPS-app-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="SAPS app screenshot 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SAPS-app-screenshot-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SAPS-app-screenshot-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SAPS-app-screenshot-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320345" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MySAPS-app-on-phone.jpg" alt="MySAPS app on phone" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MySAPS-app-on-phone.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MySAPS-app-on-phone-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MySAPS-app-on-phone-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
