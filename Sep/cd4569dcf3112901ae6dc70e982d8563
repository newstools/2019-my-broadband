The latest beta version of WhatsApp for Android includes a number of new features, including the first signs of Facebook Pay appearing in the mobile app. Following the rebranding of WhatsApp to “WhatsApp from Facebook”, Facebook is working to integrate a mobile payment platform into WhatsApp which may also be compatible with the company’s Libra cryptocurrency in future. WABetaInfo found the first references to the Facebook Pay platform within the latest beta version of WhatsApp for Android, confirming that Facebook is working on integrating the payment feature into its messaging app. Currently, the only option available on Facebook Pay in WhatsApp is to set a new payment method, but this is expected to be expanded in future. The latest WhatsApp beta for Android also includes the ability to hide muted status updates in a collapsable menu. There is a new WhatsApp beta available for iOS too, which includes a new feature that allows users to add stickers, text, and emojis to media before sending photos and videos to a contact. This feature can also be used within status updates and is accessible by any iOS users who have downloaded the latest beta update from TestFlight. The latest WhatsApp beta for iOS includes a number of bug fixes which were introduced with the launch of iOS 13.
