The iStore has stated that the iPhone 11 range will be available in South Africa from 27 September 2019. The local retailer will offer the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. iPhone 11 contract deals from Vodacom, Telkom, and MTN will also be available from the iStore – along with a trade-in special. The iStore said that customers with an old iPhone can trade their device in and save up to R330 per month on their new or upgraded Vodacom contract. “For the first time, iStore is offering a way for customers to pay less monthly for their Vodacom contract when trading in and upgrading to the new iPhone,” the retailer said. “This means that customers have the option to trade in their current iPhone 7 through to iPhone X by bringing it into an iStore for evaluation, selecting their Vodacom iPhone contract, and then enjoying reduced monthly payments.” Additionally, the iStore will offer a free extended warranty and screen replacement valued at R1,999 to customers who upgrade to a new iPhone.
