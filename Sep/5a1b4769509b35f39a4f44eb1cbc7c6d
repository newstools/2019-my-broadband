After a long period of testing and development, Facebook has finally rolled out its online Dating platform. Facebook Dating is currently only available in the United States, although the company’s website states that it is currently being rolled out to users older than 18 across selected markets. The platform is focused on providing users with safety and control in addition to effective matchmaking, and it features heavy integration with Instagram and the Facebook ecosystem. It is important to note that a Facebook user’s Dating page is completely separate from their standard profile, and they can control how much of their personal information is shared between the services. By launching a dating platform, Facebook has placed itself in competition with established players like Match.com, which has seen great success worldwide with its Tinder dating app. There are a few key differences between these two platforms, however. We have outlined the major features and mechanics of Tinder and Facebook Dating below. The biggest difference between Tinder and Facebook Dating is that the latter doesn’t rely on a “swiping” system. “Facebook Dating isn’t about swiping or having to wait for someone to like you to get a first chance at reaching out,” Facebook said. “If you are interested in someone, you can comment directly on their profile or tap on the Like button to let them know.” This approach is a lot more personal than Tinder’s which does not allow for comments and uses an anonymous swiping system to pair users. Facebook will also not match you with any of your friends unless you have tagged them as a Secret Crush and they have done the same for you. Both platforms work through mobile apps and desktop websites and connect to Instagram and Facebook to source personal information. The biggest difference in how they function is that while the Secret Crush system on Facebook Dating provides a semi-anonymous matching tool, the standard Facebook Dating experience is relatively open and personal. Tinder, on the other hand, uses a more gamified system with features like “Super Likes” and bonus swipes, and provides greater anonymity until users are actually matched together. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319535" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Dating-1.jpg" alt="Facebook Dating 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Dating-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Dating-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Facebook-Dating-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Facebook Dating is currently completely free to users in countries where it is available, and the company has not yet provided any information about its future pricing plans. In addition to being free, Facebook Dating does currently not have any adverts, as it exists partly as a tool to promote Facebook usage. The basic version of Tinder gives you free swipes which could result in matches if the recipients have also swiped right, in addition to a single “Super Like” per day which will notify a user that you have liked them. If users want to access more functionality or Super Likes, they will need to subscribe to Tinder Plus or Tinder Gold. Tinder Plus is priced at $10 per month if you are under 30, but it will cost you $20 per month if you are 31 or older. This includes five Super Likes per day, one Boost each month, and the ability to rewind your last swipe. Tinder Gold is priced at around $30 per month and includes all of these features in addition to the ability to see all the users who like you.
