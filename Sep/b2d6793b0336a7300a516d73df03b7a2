Rain previously said it was planning to launch commercial 5G products in September, but there is now uncertainty about the company’s 5G launch. In February, Rain launched its 5G network in Johannesburg using Huawei’s equipment, including its core network, bearer network, and base station systems. Rain CEO Willem Roos added that the network will provide fibre-like speeds without the “installation complexities, time delays, and cost of laying fibre”. The company added that it will cover major cities in South Africa with its 5G network, including Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban. Rain said at the time that it would launch commercial 5G products and plans in September 2019. MyBroadband followed up with Rain about its 5G launch scheduled for this month, but this may not happen as planned. “The Rain team continues to work hard to launch our 5G offering in the near future,” Roos told MyBroadband. When asked whether Rain will still meet its own September launch deadline, Roos said he could not confirm the launch date with certainty. He added that he could not answer questions about the launch, planned products, and how it will affect its current mobile offerings at this stage. The planned launch of Rain’s 5G products also impacts the mobile operator’s existing mobile packages. Rain’s chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga previously said new mobile tariffs would be introduced when the company launched its commercial 5G products. The new mobile products may also see the company’s popular R250 Unlimited Off-Peak plan being discontinued. Rain initially planned to stop its unlimited offer on 30 June 2019, but this decision was put on hold until it launched its new 5G products.
