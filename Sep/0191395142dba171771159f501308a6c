Numerous DStv Premium subscribers are complaining that they cannot stream the latest Springbok game live. The DStv Now problems today follow a similar problem last week when the service experienced downtime during the Springboks versus New Zealand rugby world cup match. MultiChoice explained that all subscribers who were logged in ahead of the start of the match were able to view the game seamlessly. However, there was a problem with the influx of fresh logins on the platform, which had to be individually verified, causing a delay in accessing the platform. Multiple social media users complained that they were unable to watch the game on DStv Now, with several stating they missed the entire match as a result. The company added that its engineering team has been “working tirelessly” ahead of the rugby world cup to ensure “preparedness for a record number of online viewers”. Similar problems are now experienced by some DStv subscribers who are trying to stream the Springboks versus Namibia match. Users of both the online service and the DStv Now app complained about streaming problems. The message reads, “Sorry, we’re unable to play this video right now, something went wrong on our side. Please retry in a few minutes or play another video”. “Thanks DStv. No idea why I even have premium subscription,” one user said. “Trying to use the DStv Now app to watch the SA v Namibia game but this is the message I keep getting,” said another. The screenshots below were posted by DStv Now users on Saturday. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321566" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Now-Down.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="316" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Now-Down.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Now-Down-600x296.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321568" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Now-Down-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="1089" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Now-Down-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Now-Down-2-235x400.jpg 235w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Now-Down-2-253x430.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
