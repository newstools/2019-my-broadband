Code discovered in iOS 13 by developer Steve Troughton-Smith seemingly confirms that Apple is developing an AR headset. Troughton-Smith found a readme file in a new release of the OS that explains how employees can use AR apps on their iPhones without utilising the physical AR headset. He also discovered iOS 13 StarBoard frameworks – Apple’s system shell for stereo augmented reality apps –  as well as a gamepad profile for a device that is to be used with stereo AR apps. Apple did not mention any plans for AR or VR at its iPhone event last night, suggesting that the headset could only be announced next year. The company launched three new iPhones at its special event, along with the new Apple Watch 5 Series and a new 7th-generation iPad.
