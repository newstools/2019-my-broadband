Huawei has announced that its Mate 30 premium smartphone will launch on 19 September at its “Rethink Possibilities” event in Munich, Germany. The company confirmed this date with a teaser video posted to its Twitter page. The Mate 30 series will seemingly continue Huawei’s partnership with Leica to deliver the technology behind its smartphone cameras. Google previously told The Verge that the Mate 30 would not be able to launch with official Google apps because of the ongoing ban on US companies doing business with Huawei. However, Huawei is committed to ensuring that its smartphones continue to run Android, Huawei CBG South Africa vice president Likun Zhao told MyBroadband. “Huawei wants to maintain one standard and one ecosystem for our smartphones,” said Zhao.
