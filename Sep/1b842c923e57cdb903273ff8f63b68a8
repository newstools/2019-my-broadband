Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has committed to launching 321 public Wi-Fi hotspots at schools in the province over the next financial year. “I am excited on behalf of the 244 schools across the City of Cape Town Metro and 77 schools in the Overberg, West Coast, Cape Winelands, as well as Eden and Central Karoo areas who will soon have access to the Internet at free public Wi-Fi zones,” said DA spokesperson Ricardo Mackenzie. “The rollout will specifically prioritise disadvantaged areas such as Gugulethu, Nyanga, Bishop Lavis and Philippi.” Mackenzie said that feedback from schools which received access to free public Wi-Fi is that it has helped both teachers and learners to complete their tasks and assignments. According to the DA, surveys have shown that increased access to the Internet also enables schools and surrounding communities to have better access to job opportunities. Winde confirmed that 103 hotspots were previously launched in the 2017/18 financial year as part of a project that aimed to offer total Internet access in the province.
