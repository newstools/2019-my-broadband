SEACOM today announced that its new point-of-presence (PoP) node in Bloemfontein is now online. Businesses in and around Bloemfontein can benefit from a wider range of Enterprise solutions through “uncontended, unthrottled SEACOM internet connectivity with direct low latency routes to public cloud environments, both locally and internationally”. “Bloemfontein was identified as a key market where we could strengthen our service offerings, geographic network reach and broaden our market position,” said SEACOM CEO Byron Clatterbuck. “Bloemfontein now becomes a strategic connectivity hub for SEACOM which already connects South Africa to the East Coast of Africa, India and Europe with over 60 points of presence across South Africa, including major data centres in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban,” he added. The inclusion of PoP support in Bloemfontein, the sixth-largest city in the country, ultimately means local internet service providers in the region will be able to bolster their high-speed broadband offerings and provide better quality connectivity to their clients. SEACOM provides an extensive network of ICT data infrastructure to the African continent, which includes multiple submarine cables. It launched the first submarine cable systems along Africa’s Eastern and Southern coasts in 2009, which helped to drastically drive down internet costs in South Africa.
