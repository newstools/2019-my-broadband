Google is currently testing an Incognito Mode for its Maps navigation app, XDA Developers reports. The feature was added in the latest update for the Android version of the Maps Preview app and is available in closed beta to testers who are part of the Google Maps preview group. Incognito Mode for Google Maps can be switched on through the app’s search bar and will disable location sharing as well as location history. The feature also stops saving your Maps browsing history and will no longer use personal data to suggest locations and search options. Google has added a number of features to its Maps app over the last few months, including merging the functionality of its now-defunct Trips app into Maps. The company said it would migrate features previously found in Trips to its Search and Maps applications following the discontinuation of the travel app. Following this change, users can use Google Maps to find things to do in a destination – such as iconic places, city guide lists, events, or restaurants – by swiping up on the “Explore” tab or searching for a destination. XDA Developers editor-in-chief Mishall Rahman tweeted a GIF of the new Maps Incognito Mode, shown below.
