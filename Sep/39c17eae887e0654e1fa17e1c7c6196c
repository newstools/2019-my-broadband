At Gamescom 2019, EA held its first meeting of the Healthy Communities Player Council, a group of gamers working with EA to address toxicity in gaming. As part of the meeting, EA discussed its own efforts to address toxicity in online gaming, while the council gave EA ideas on what it could do better. Suggestions included 2-factor authentication for EA accounts, alerting players if their reports lead to bans, AI chat moderation, and increased cultural representation across in-game characters. EA said that it will work with the Player Council in the long-term to continuously fight against toxicity and cheating, including hosting quarterly planned meetings and other future summits. “Hate has no place in gaming; we will do everything in our power to ensure that everyone is welcome,” said EA. “Online toxicity is just that – toxic. It’s unhealthy for everyone.”
