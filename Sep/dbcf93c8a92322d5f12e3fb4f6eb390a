Apple announced the launch of its new iPhone 11 Pro range. “This is the most advanced and detailed iPhone we have made yet,” Apple said. The iPhone 11 Pro will ship in four colours: Midnight Green, Space Grey, Silver, and Gold. It is available in 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch models named the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max respectively. Both of these devices boast high-resolution Super Retina XDR AMOLED displays that have a 2-million-to-1 contrast ratio, 1,200 nits of brightness, and are 15% more power-efficient than previous-generation panels. Apple said its A13 Bionic chip is capable of performing up to one trillion operations per second, and includes the latest-generation Apple machine-learning technology. The company said that iPhone 11 Pro features the best machine-learning technology in any mobile platform. The chip uses a 7nm manufacturing process and includes over 8.5 billion transistors, with all of its cores being up to 20% faster than the A12 Bionic while also being more power-efficient. “All of this translates to great performance and battery life for our customers,” Apple said. The chip accomplishes all of this by using 15% less power, with the iPhone 11 Pro delivering up to four hours more battery life compared to the iPhone Xs, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max delivering up to five hours more than the Xs Max. The full specifications of the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are listed below. Both the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max feature triple-camera systems which comprise a 12MP wide lens, 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens. The three lenses are housed in a square module in the corner on the rear of the device, and this configuration enables optical zoom of up to 2x along with other powerful features. All three cameras are capable of shooting 4K 60fps video with slow-motion, time-lapse, and other functionality. Apple has also built advanced video and photo editing features into its Photos app in iOS 13 to enable iPhone 11 Pro users to tweak their photos on their device. Additionally, using the new version of Filmic Pro, users can shoot with two cameras at the same time, which can be used to take simultaneous video with the rear ultra-wide lens and the front-facing camera. The device’s new TrueDepth camera supports Smart HDR technology and offers a wider angle for better selfies. Other important features of the iPhone 11 Pro include IP68 water and dust resistance, Wi-Fi 6, a stronger cellular connection, wireless charging, and enhanced Face ID biometric security.
