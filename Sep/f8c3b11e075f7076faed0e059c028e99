Samsung launched its new Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+ smartphones last month, with the devices shipping at the end of August 2019. These premium phones combine Samsung’s best design features – including its Infinity-O display and curved edges – with a high-end chipset and impressive specifications to deliver a top-of-the-range experience. Another great feature unique to the Note series is the S Pen stylus, which can be stored inside the chassis of the smartphone and used to control various functions wirelessly via gestures, such as camera modes or music playback. The S Pen can also be used to write notes in the smartphone’s Notes application, which then translates handwriting into editable text. Samsung provided us with the larger of its two new devices – the Galaxy Note 10+ – to try out, and we immediately set to work testing out the impressive hardware. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319509" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-1-640x384.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 1" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-1-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-1-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-1-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-1-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Like the previous-generation Note smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ boasts a large display and Bluetooth-enabled S-Pen stylus. The Galaxy Note 10+ has an improved quad-lens primary camera system, however, which is positioned on the rear of the smartphone and includes a specialised depth camera to enable improved object detection. Samsung has also added an in-screen fingerprint sensor to the Galaxy Note 10+, removing the fingerprint sensor at the back of the smartphone. The most impressive offerings are found inside the device, however, as it boasts a whopping 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. This places the Galaxy Note 10+ on par with many consumer laptops, and the addition of an overhauled stylus and new DeX features allows users to more easily take advantage of this powerful hardware. Below are the full specifications of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319511" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2-640x384.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 2" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Based on our experience with the device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is a big step up compared to the previous-generation Note 9. The device has a slimmer chassis with a bigger screen, making it more comfortable to hold and easier to use. Moving the fingerprint sensor to the front display also removes a design issue with Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 device that led to users dirtying the camera lens when they tried to unlock their smartphone. The Infinity-O display is also a definite improvement over the previous design, as it offers more screen real estate without cutting into the edge of the panel. The camera on the Galaxy Note 10+ is a massive upgrade, offering unique augmented reality features as well as intelligent photo capture with a range of powerful effects and shooting modes. Samsung has also finally dropped the Bixby button on its Note devices, silently acknowledging the controversy of the dedicated hardware button for its virtual assistant. The Galaxy Note 10+ now simply has a single power button and two volume buttons on the left, with the right side of the chassis devoid of all physical buttons. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319515" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-4-640x384.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 4" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-4-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-4-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-4-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-4-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10+ is similar in design to the Galaxy S10+ unveiled earlier this year, but the Note series has always differentiated itself by being one of the few devices on the market with an integrated stylus. The S-Pen on the Galaxy Note 10+ supports the same excellent features as previous generations, as well as some exciting new applications. When you are within certain apps such as the camera or image gallery, you can navigate using remote gestures with the S-Pen in your hand. This is great for taking selfies, presenting images to others, or controlling media from a distance. Another great feature is the dynamic conversion of handwriting to editable text. Using the S-Pen to write on the device’s display, you can choose whether to convert your writing to editable text on a word-by-word basis, or you can convert entire pages and paragraphs when you are finished with them. These passages can also be converted back into handwriting at your leisure. Samsung’s Galaxy Note series remains the perfect device for power users, offering the best in productivity and performance, and the Galaxy Note 10+ builds on this reputation to offer the latest features paired with some of the best hardware on the market. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319513" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-3-640x384.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-3-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-3-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-3-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-3-1200x720.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
