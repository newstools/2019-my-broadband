Data from NetMarketShare shows that Windows 10’s market share surpassed 50% in August. 50.99% of the consumer desktop operating system market is now Windows 10, while Windows 7’s market share has dropped to 30.34%. The transition of many users from Windows 7 to Windows 10 has been accelerated after Microsoft announced that support for Windows 7 will end in January 2020. Microsoft recommended that users upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 to continue receiving updates in the future. However, Windows 10 has suffered various issues over the past few months, which are likely to have limited uptake of the operating system. Most recently, the latest Windows update caused performance issues for many users due to high CPU usage. Meanwhile, the latest version of Mac OS X, 10.14, increased from 5.68% to 5.95% market share, while Linux droped from 1.66% to 1.26%. Windows XP also saw its market share decrease – from 1.68% to 1.57% over the past month – although it is still more popular than Linux, despite being over 18 years old.
