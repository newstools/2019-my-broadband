Cell C’s mobile network is suffering significant downtime across the country, according to DownDetector. An increase in network outage reports began at about 07:00, and the number of complaints increased substantially over time. The mobile network’s Twitter account was also inundated with reports of network issues. “There was an issue, however our engineers are working on resolving it. Please try to reboot your device within the next hour,” tweeted Cell C support. According to reports, users experienced downtime across the country, with massive spikes in downtime reports occurring in urban centres such as Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. Update – Cell C told MyBroadband that the issues reported were exclusive to WhatsApp, and that they have since been fixed. “Cell C this morning briefly experienced intermittent issues with WhatsApp media (photo and video) download,” Cell C said. “The problem has since been resolved.” <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319961" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cell-c-outages-640x255.png" alt="cell c outages" width="640" height="255" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cell-c-outages-640x255.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cell-c-outages-600x239.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cell-c-outages-768x306.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cell-c-outages.png 848w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
