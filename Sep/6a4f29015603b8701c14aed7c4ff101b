The DA has asked DStv to share the Springbok’s Rugby World Cup games with the SABC in the “spirit of nation building”. The DA said it “shares the disappointment of South African rugby fans who cannot afford DStv and will not be able to watch World Cup rugby games”. “We understand why the cash-strapped public broadcaster the SABC could not afford to purchase the broadcasting rights for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The SABC is currently facing a financial crisis largely as a result of corruption and financial mismanagement that took place during the Hlaudi Motsoeneng era,’ said the DA. The party goes on to tell DStv that it should overlook the R420 million it would have cost the SABC to broadcast the Rugby World Cup with a sub-licence from DStv’s Supersport. “Radio rights would have been also unaffordable, particularly in production costs to do justice to rugby fans who usually get commentary in languages other than English,” said the DA. “In the spirit of nation building, MultiChoice should at the very least consider sharing games in which the Springboks are playing with the public broadcaster. This will go a long way in demonstrating goodwill to the people of South Africa and contributing to nation building.”
