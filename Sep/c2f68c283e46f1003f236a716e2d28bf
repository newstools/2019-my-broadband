Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei told the Economist that Huawei is willing to give other companies “perpetual access” to its existing 5G patents, licences, blueprints, and code for a once-off fee. Ren believes this would help to ease concerns that Huawei’s 5G technology is a cybersecurity threat to Western nations. Any company who takes this deal will be able to access Huawei’s source code, meaning that they could have full control over any infrastructure they build with Huawei technology. Huawei will be able to continue developing its own 5G technology, meaning that this move could essentially signal a “reset” in terms of the 5G technology market. Huawei’s 5G technology has been heavily chastised by the US, which believes that the implementation of Huawei infrastructure provides the Chinese government with a gateway into breaching the cybersecurity of nations who use it. These concerns have prompted the US to pressure various countries not to use Huawei’s technology, including the UK. However, South Africa’s government has embraced Huawei’s 5G technology, with President Ramaphosa noting that the US ban could have serious ramifications on South Africa’s 5G development. “The president expressed his concern at any efforts to curtail the efforts of Huawei to deliver a comprehensive, and what we believe to be an advanced solution in the telecommunications space,” said Ramaphosa’s spokesperson, Khusela Diko.
