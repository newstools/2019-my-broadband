Microsoft has introduced a YouTube video series called Python for Beginners that aims to teach aspiring programmers the fundamentals of the Python programming language. The series is presented by Microsoft senior program manager Christopher Harrison and Susan Ibach, who is one of Microsoft’s AI Gaming unit’s business development managers. “Even though we won’t cover everything there is to know about Python in the course, we want to make sure we give you the foundation on programming in Python, starting from common everyday code and scenarios,” Microsoft said. The 44-part course focuses on Python version 3.x and is intended for users who have some basic understanding of the JavaScript language or have tried out the Scratch visual programming language. In addition to the videos, Microsoft has also posted a collection of supplementary resources, including slideshows and samples of coding. According to ZDNet, the company may benefit from having a larger pool of capable Python developers that could use the language to build applications in Microsoft’s Azure Machine Learning Studio. The course’s tutorials range from three to ten minutes in length and cover features such as performing error handling, working with loops, and configuring Visual Studio Code.
