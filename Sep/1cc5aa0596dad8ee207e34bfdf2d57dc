Twitter announced that it has begun rolling out its “Hide Replies” feature in the United States and Japan. This feature allows users to hide replies which they think do not contribute to the conversation, obscuring them behind a collapsable hidden replies menu. This means that if somebody replies to your tweet with an offensive or irrelevant remark, you now have the ability to hide their reply from the main list of responses for everyone else. Twitter previously tested this feature in Canada and found that it had a positive effect on discourse while prompting users to reconsider their behaviour. “People mostly hide replies that they think are irrelevant, abusive or unintelligible,” Twitter said. “Those who used the tool thought it was a helpful way to control what they saw, similar to when keywords are muted.” “We saw that people were more likely to reconsider their interactions when their tweet was hidden.” Twitter said it was now expanding its test area to determine if the “Hide Replies” feature will continue to be met with positive feedback from users. The company has not stated its timeline for rolling out the “Hide Replies” feature internationally.
