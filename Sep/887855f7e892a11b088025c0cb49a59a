A vulnerability in iOS 13 discovered by security researcher Jose Rodriguez allows attackers to bypass the lock screen on your device. This exploit leverages a bug when activating a FaceTime call and then using Siri to access the device’s contact list – which bypasses the lock screen security check. Once the contacts list has been opened in this way, an attacker can access phone numbers, address information, email addresses, and any other information stored in the device’s contact list. The vulnerability can still be exploited in the current version of iOS 13 available to consumers, despite Rodriguez sending the details of the exploit to Apple on 17 July. However, Rodriguez has stated that the issue is fixed in the iOS 13 beta, which will be available on 30 September 2019. Apple’s next big update for its new mobile operating system – which would bring the version up to iOS 13.1 – is already in development. This update is expected to include a number of features which will not be available for the initial release of iOS 13. These include the option for users to share their ETA through the Maps app and the addition of a volume indicator for AirPods.
