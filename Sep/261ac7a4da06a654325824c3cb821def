A research partner of Tesla has published a paper about a battery cell that could last over a million miles, Electrek reports. Jeff Dahn and the rest of his lab released the test results on 6 September for the Li-Ion battery cell, which uses a single crystal NMC cathode as well as a new, superior electrolyte. Dahn said that his team has been conducting various tests of the cell technology that have spanned up to three years in some cases. The battery cell would work well with Tesla’s planned fleet of robot taxis, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said are being “designed, tested, and validated for one million miles of operation”. Tesla does not currently have a battery pack that can last a million miles, but has said that it is will have one by next year – a claim which now appears to be likely thanks to Dahn’s research.
