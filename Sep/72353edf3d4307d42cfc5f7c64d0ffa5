Huawei CEO Richard Yu has criticised the US for implementing its ban on Huawei, saying that it has been a terrible decision for the smartphone industry. Yu was speaking with journalists following the launch of the Huawei Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro smartphones. According to Yu, the US ban has had a terrible effect on the smartphone industry and makes no sense. “I think that this US ban has destroyed this industry. It has split the industry – it is harmful for US companies,” said Yu. “The smartphone as a product has no relationship with network infrastructure or backbone 5G security. So why they are doing this – it is really difficult to understand why they are like this.” Yu added that the company was being used as a pawn in political games by the US. “It is a US-China issue, and Huawei is a bargaining chip for it. That’s not good,” said Yu. “Some politicians are playing games and making a lot of noise – that is unfair to us. They relate us with China, but Huawei is a global company.” Yu said that Huawei wants to support Google and its partnership with the company, and will only use its own solutions if it cannot work with the company in the future. “HarmonyOS is ready for deployment in certain areas, but we have postponed it at this time because we still want to work with Google,” said Yu. Yu said that if the US ban is resolved and the company is allowed to rekindle its previous relationship with Google, it can implement Google services over a single night. “In the past years, we have made big contributions to the Android ecosystem. We are leading many of the innovations. We bring a lot of profit to US companies.”
