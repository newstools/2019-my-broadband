Driving from Pretoria to Cape Town in an electric vehicle should now be an easier undertaking. GridCars, the largest installer of public EV charging stations in South Africa, has completed its national EV highway rollout that connects major cities along some of South Africa’s busiest highways. This is according to Pierre Spies, CEO of Alviva Holdings, the company that owns GridCars. Spies made the announcement during a presentation on Tuesday of Alviva’s annual results for the year ended June 2019. In September 2018, GridCars collaborated with Jaguar Land Rover SA to create the Jaguar Powerway, consisting of 22 charging stations located at various fuel stations along the N1 between Gauteng and Cape Town, the N2 between Cape Town and East London and the N3 between Gauteng and Durban. In February 2019, it was also announced that Shell had sought the services of GridCars to install more electric charging stations at some of its garages, based on demand. By the end of March 2019, GridCars had installed 200 stations in total in urban areas and along highways. Most of the EV charging stations on GridCars’ public network offer a 60kWh capacity charge, capable of charging a Jaguar I-Pace up to 80% in just over an hour. With a maximum theoretical range of 470km per charge, this means a total of three stops lasting about an hour and a half each should be enough to get you from Gauteng to Cape Town in the I-Pace. The stations also have sockets for charging plug-in hybrid vehicles, like the Range Rover PHEV and the Mercedes-Benz C350e. Alviva’s revenue from electric charge-point sales totalled R8.6 million, stated the company’s financial results for the year.
