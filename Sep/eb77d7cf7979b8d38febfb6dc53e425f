This is according to Ken Hu, Deputy Chairman of Huawei, who was speaking at the Huawei Connect 2019 Conference in Shanghai. “Technology shouldn’t sit in an ivory tower. Instead, it should benefit all humanity. We firmly believe that digital technology will benefit every person, home, and organization,” said Hu.
