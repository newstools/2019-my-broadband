MyBroadband and BusinessTech have seen a big increase in the number of companies advertising on their platforms in 2019. Both sites have also seen an increase in the number of campaigns running, thanks to the excellent return on investment existing clients receive. In particular, partner content, targeted banner advertising, and event sponsorships are proving very popular among clients. “As more companies increase their digital advertising budgets, we are seeing an increased demand for our products,” said MyBroadband Business MD Kevin Lancaster. “Our digital advertising services are ideal for many companies, as we can conceive, produce, and publish content and banners within 24-48 hours. This makes us the perfect platform for dynamic companies.” “All our services also include comprehensive performance reports.
