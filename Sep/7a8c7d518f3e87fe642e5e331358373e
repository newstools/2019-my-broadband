Nintendo has applied for a patent in the United States for its Joy-Con Switch controller that would enable the top half of the controller to bend, making gaming more ergonomic. To support this new feature, Nintendo would also have to implement a flexible circuit board within the controller, the patent stated. The patent is far from being implemented, however, and is essentially the US version of an international patent that the company filed back in February 2018. Nintendo has given no indication of any plans to offer this updated controller to the mass market, but filing the patent in the US could mean that Nintendo is considering implementing the technology. The Nintendo Switch has been incredibly popular since its launch, having competed favourablyÂ with consoles such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this year. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319237" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bendable-switch-controller-640x427.png" alt="bendable switch controller" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bendable-switch-controller-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bendable-switch-controller-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bendable-switch-controller-768x512.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bendable-switch-controller-1200x800.png 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bendable-switch-controller.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
