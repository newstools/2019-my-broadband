The Broadcast Research Council of South Africa (BRCSA) has released its television audience measurements for August 2019. The data includes a list of the most-watched shows on DStv, SABC 1, 2, 3, and Etv. The BRCSA said the report does not give the total viewership of DStv commercial channels, and the figures reflect viewership on the platform at the top tier. For instances where the same show appeared across multiple channels, we only included figures for the channel where it had the highest number of viewers. The table below details the most-watched shows in South Africa in August 2019. The SABC’s channels undisputably enjoy the lion’s share of South Africa’s TV viewership, although this has not aided the profitability of the public broadcaster. The state-owned company is in a dire financial position, and is considering increasing TV licence fees in an effort to improve its situation. SABC CFO Yolande van Biljon recently said that proposal to increase TV licence fees had been drafted and sent to the Minister of Communications, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. The company is engaged in negotiations with the government in an effort to obtain a state bailout to fund its turnaround plan. DStv does not have as many viewers as the SABC, as it caters to a smaller market, but it is also suffering due to the increasing proliferation of online streaming services. The company is bleeding Premium subscribers and has even attempted to entice former subscribers back to its service with special discounts.
