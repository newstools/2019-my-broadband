Xbox One owners can now use Google Assistant to control their consoles. Microsoft and Google announced a beta of the new Xbox Action feature in two separate blog posts on Thursday. Xbox owners could already control the console with Microsoft’s own voice assistant Cortana, as well as Amazon’s Alexa. The new Google Assistant functionality will allow you to use your voice to turn your Xbox console on or off, open apps or launch games, record in-game videos, and snap screenshots. In video playback, users will be able to play or pause and adjust volume using voice commands. Microsoft has posted a complete list of compatible commands here. The feature works with Android devices, Google Assistant-enabled smart displays and speakers, as well as the Google Home and Assistant apps on iOS. To participate in the beta, users must join Microsoft’s Google Group with a Google account and then add and set up the Xbox on the Google Home app on their Android or iOS device. They can then log in to the Microsoft account used on their Xbox to complete the integration. For now, Xbox Action for the Google Assistant is only available in English, but the companies have indicated they hope to expand the feature to more languages by the official launch “this fall”.
