Mozilla has announced a new extension for its Firefox browser named Private Network, which allows users to easily connect to a VPN without a third-party application. The service uses a proxy server provided by Cloudflare and requires users to sign in to their Firefox account in order to connect. Private Network encrypts the web addresses you visit and the data you send to websites, and it hides your location from websites and ad trackers. The service is compatible with the latest version of the Firefox desktop browser on multiple platforms, and can be removed at any time once installed, just like a standard Firefox extension. The Private Network extension is currently in a testing phase and is only available to users in the United States.
