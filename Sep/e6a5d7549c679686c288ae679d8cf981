Apple has announced the launch of its new gaming platform which is built into its App Store – Apple Arcade. Arcade will be available for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS and will include a collection of “groundbreaking exclusive new games”. Users can access the entire library of Arcade games on the App Store by paying a monthly subscription fee, and new games will be added every month. The Arcade tab in the App store includes recommendations, game trailers, and editorial content such as game guides. Apple Arcade will be available from 19 September 2019 and will be priced at $4.99 per month with a one-month free trial for new users.
