Vodacom has lowered its call termination rates in accordance with regulations published by ICASA last year. The company detailed its new call termination rates in a letter sent to interconnection partners, stating that the new rates would take effect from 1 October 2019. These changes were dictated in the original call termination regulations published by ICASA, which required all operators to reduce call termination rates over a period of three years concluding in 2020. The first changes were implemented last year, and potentially resulted in significant job losses at Telkom, with CEO Sipho Maseko stating that the decision penalised Telkom far more than its competitors. All mobile operators are required to bring their call termination rates in line with regulatory requirements by 1 October 2019. MyBroadband asked Vodacom whether it had changed its call termination rates, and the company confirmed that it had changed the rates in accordance with the regulations published by ICASA. “We can confirm that we have decreased local call termination rates in line with ICASA’s Call Termination Regulations (CTR) as published last year,” Vodacom said. Vodacom’s new call termination rates as reported in its letter to partners are detailed below, and include a breakdown of new national and international rates, as well as call origination rates (CORs) for toll-free calls.
