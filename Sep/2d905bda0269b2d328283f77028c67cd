Boston Dynamics has showcased more of the advanced movement capabilities of its humanoid Atlas robot. In the robotics company’s latest video, Atlas is seen performing a series of impressive gymnastic manoeuvres, including a handstand, front rolls, and several jumps and aerial twists. “We created the manoeuvres using new techniques that streamline the development process,” Boston Dynamics said. According to the company, the routine is performed with an “optimization algorithm” that “transforms high-level descriptions of each manoeuvre into dynamically-feasible reference motions”. Atlas then tracks the motions using a model predictive controller that smoothly blends from one manoeuvre to the next, Boston Dynamics said. The robot has previously been shown running and jumping through a parkour course, picking up and placing packages, and opening doors. The company is also working on several other robots, such as the dog-like Spot Mini, and the fast-moving, wheel-driven Handle. Boston Dynamics has also officially begun selling its Spot quadrupedal robot, which is available for order through the company’s website. Spot is not available to the general public, but Boston Dynamics said that any company with a good idea for the application of the robot and the funds for the hardware should be able to acquire a Spot robot. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
