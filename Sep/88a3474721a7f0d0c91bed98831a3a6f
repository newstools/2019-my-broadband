Many South African Internet service providers (ISPs) have launched fixed-LTE products after Telkom announced that it will turn off its ADSL service. Telkom announced earlier this year that it is actively migrating postpaid fixed copper-based voice and DSL customers to fibre and wireless. Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko said they are moving DSL subscribers to more stable and similarly-priced products which would not be affected by cable theft and similar interruptions. “There will come a time when we switch off the copper technology, because we don’t want to do maintain two or three different networks at the same time,” Maseko said. Telkom previously told MyBroadband that it hoped to have moved all ADSL customers in fibre-connected areas to the newer technology by the end of September. Where there is fibre coverage, Telkom’s ADSL subscribers will be migrated to similar fibre-to-the-home services. In areas where ADSL users do not have fibre coverage, they will be moved to fixed-LTE packages. LTE offers similar or higher average speeds to ADSL with pricing to match current ADSL packages, with the exception of high-usage and uncapped products. This means that most current ADSL users will receive faster speeds at a similar monthly price to what they currently pay for DSL. Many ISPs have recently launched fixed-LTE products, including Axxess, Supersonic, Afrihost, and Webafrica. Most ISPs launched products using Telkom’s LTE network, except for Supersonic which uses MTN’s network. Vodacom also offers its own fixed-LTE products.
