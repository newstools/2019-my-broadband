A study from the Boston University School of Medicine has found that “optimistic men and women demonstrated, on average, an 11-15% longer lifespan”. As reported by NPR, the optimistic individuals had far greater odds of reaching 85 years of age when compared to the least optimistic group. The report stated that these findings were independent of factors like socioeconomic status, health conditions, depression, social integration, and health behaviours. The university study comprised of 69,744 women and 1,429 men, who completed a survey to measure their levels of optimism, overall health, and habits. “Health outcomes from women in the study were tracked for 10 years, while the men’s health was followed for 30 years,” stated the report. It must be noted that the most optimistic individuals may have been able to better handle stress, added the report.
