Apple has implemented a screen replacement program for the aluminium versions of its Watch Series 2 and Series 3. “Apple has determined that, under very rare circumstances, a crack may form along the rounded edge of the screen in aluminium models of an Apple Watch Series 2 or Series 3,” said Apple. “The crack may begin on one side and then may continue around the screen.” Either Apple or an Apple Authorised Service Provider will replace the display on these watches at no charge if the user suffers this issue. The following 38mm and 42mm aluminium Apple watches are included in the program: This deal is only available if the watch is still under its standard warranty, which is three years after the first retail sale of the watch model or one year from the start date of this screen replacement program – whichever is longer.
