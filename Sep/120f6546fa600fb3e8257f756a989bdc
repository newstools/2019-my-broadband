MTN has launched a new mobile price plan for South African small businesses, called Made to Share. The packages are aimed at giving business owners control over their connectivity spend. “The innovative Made To Share solution offers business owners the ability to actively manage their spend of data and airtime to ultimately improve their operational and cost efficiencies,” said MTN. Made To Share gives up to 20 employees the ability to receive airtime and data bundles from a single, shareable wallet. The wallet can be managed by a business owner or a designated administrator, using the MyMTN App. Admins can also add or remove users in real-time, set spending limits, and monitor usage. Wanda Matandela, Chief Enterprise Officer at MTN Business, said Made To Share subscribers are given the option to choose from a variety of tariff plans that are customised to suit SMEs. Shareable data bundles range from 3GB to 700GB, while shareable airtime starts from 200 minutes of airtime – with the more extensive tariff plan offering 2,500 minutes per month. Contracts are available on a month-to-month basis, or for a duration of 3, 6, 12, or 24 months.
