Activision’s eagerly anticipated reboot of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare will feature cross-play across all platforms. Players will be able to compete in the same games, whether they play on a PC, Xbox One, or PS4. Developer Infinity Ward has explained how cross-play will work ahead of the start of an open beta on Thursday. The feature will be implemented in a similar way to how it works in Epic Games’ Fortnite. Modern Warfare will support both gamepad controllers as well as keyboard-and-mouse setups on all platforms. Players on PC and console will be able to select from lobbies for gamepad controllers only and keyboards only in all multiplayer modes. Another lobby with no restrictions on controller setups will also be available. A Call Of Duty online account will be required to partake in cross-play. The cross-play beta begins on 19 September at 19:00 SAST and will be open to all PS4 players, whilst only Xbox One and PC Players with pre-orders for the game will have access. The beta will open to all players from 03:00 SAST on Saturday, 21 September to Monday, 23 September at 19:00. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is scheduled for release on 25 October 2019.
