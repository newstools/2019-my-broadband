When you are travelling for business, you have vastly different accommodation needs than when you’re going on vacation. Some guest houses and hotels take this into account in the way they present their listings and pictures of their establishments, but many others do not. You’ll see photos of their pool, dining area, and beautiful grounds, but may not get any indication of the size of a room or how many power outlets it has. That is where websites like Afristay shine, allowing you to narrow your search of possible places to stay based on your core requirements — what Afristay calls “Must Haves”. Afristay was MyBroadband’s accommodation partner on our recent countrywide mobile network testing project. The project involved a significant amount of travel, covering South Africa’s major cities, several secondary cities, and a few small towns along the way. As such, we got to test Afristay all over the country and not once did the platform disappoint. For the purposes of our journey around the country, we knew we could only stay in places that offered safe on-premises parking. Unfortunately, the Toyota Hilux is one of vehicles most targeted by thieves in South Africa, making secure parking an essential amenity for us. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-316205" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Afristay-Must-Have-menu.jpg" alt="&quot;Must Haves&quot; menu on the Afristay website to filter places based on your needs" width="640" height="361" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Afristay-Must-Have-menu.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Afristay-Must-Have-menu-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> We also quickly realised during our travels that reliable Wi-Fi is a huge frustration-saver, and that we need quite a bit of space and readily accessible wall sockets from which to charge all our equipment. As with secure parking, Afristay made filtering places based on the availability of Wi-Fi and Internet easy. Sadly for us, the availability of power sockets is not an amenity that guest houses or hotels typically list. However, Afristay makes it easy to query specific needs before confirming a booking. When viewing the rooms, prices, location, and information such as check in and check out time of a place, you can click on “Contact Host” to send them a question. You can then immediately book the accommodation from their response, if it was to your liking. If you are taking a vacation and want to bring your dogs, you can filter places according to whether they list themselves as “Pet Friendly” or not. If you are travelling with the aim to cook your own meals, or want to keep training while on the road, then the “Full Kitchen” and “Gym” filters may prove useful. With Afristay’s help, we booked accommodation in 22 different places from the middle of May to the end of July and, in every single instance, making the bookings was a pleasure.
