Spotify announced that it will bring its home screen widget for Android back just a month after the company said it would retire the feature. The music streaming platform originally justified its removal of the widget by saying it had been rendered redundant due to the notification and lock screen controls available via the main app. However, users were critical of the move. “We value your input and ideas, and wanted to let you know that we have made some improvements to the performance and visuals of the Android Widget. We will be reinstating it in an upcoming release on Android,” said a Spotify spokesperson. “We’re always evolving and improving our app in order to provide the best experience, so keep watching this space.”
