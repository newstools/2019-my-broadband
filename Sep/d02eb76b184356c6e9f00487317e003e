ICASA has announced that it will publish an Information Memorandum detailing the licensing process for high-demand spectrum by 31 December 2019. According to a statement released by ICASA, the memorandum outlines ICASA’s approach to the licensing of radio frequency spectrum – following the Department of Communication’s publication of the Policy on High Demand Spectrum and Policy Direction on the Licensing of a Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN). Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams published the policy direction in July 2019. “Through the publication of the Information Memorandum, the Authority further provides an opportunity to stakeholders and prospective applicants alike to make inputs and representations on the proposed licensing process, associated criteria and timelines,” said ICASA Acting Chairperson, Keabetswe Modimoeng. The statement reads that the “Information Memorandum is an important step in the licensing process for the ultimate release of the high-demand spectrum in order to give effect to government’s policy objectives of ensuring broadband access for all, transformation of the ICT sector, lower data costs, promote competition and ensure inclusive economic growth”.
