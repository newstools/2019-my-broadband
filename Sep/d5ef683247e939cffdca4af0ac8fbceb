Netgear has unveiled its latest Orbi Wi-Fi mesh system, which offers multi-gigabit Wi-Fi 6 connectivity to households. The Orbi Wi-Fi 6 can translate high-end Internet services to multi-gigabit speeds through a 2.5Gbps WAN port, or by using link aggregation to combine two ports. According to Netgear, the system is capable of supporting 4K or 8K streaming across multiple screens. It supports both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz fronthaul, and 5Ghz backhaul connectivity. “Netgear is pleased to be the first to bring to market the next generation mesh system capable of bringing multi-gigabit Internet speeds to every corner of your home,” said David Henry, VP of Connected Home Products for Netgear. Netgear said the Orbi Wi-Fi 6 mesh system has the capacity to support the ever-increasing traffic generated by the numerous connected devices in homes today, and will be able to support connected homes for “years to come.” The Orbi Wi-Fi 6 system (RBK852) will be available soon for $699.99 – which includes the router and a satellite.
