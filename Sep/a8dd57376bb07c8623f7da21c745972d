MultiChoice recently reduced the price of DStv in various African countries, including Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. MultiChoice said the monthly DStv subscription fees were reduced to make the service more competitive against streaming services. The price cuts, however, were not the same in all countries, as each country has different cost structures. These cost structures, MultiChoice said, are influenced by local dynamics such as inflation, content costs, foreign exchange rates, local taxes, and overheads. The company added that its DStv and GOtv services offer good value for money in the countries in which it operates. While many DStv subscribers across Africa enjoyed price cuts, South African DStv users’ fees remained unchanged. MultiChoice told MyBroadband that the company only reviews its DStv prices once a year when it does its business planning. MultiChoice’s senior manager for corporate communications Benedict Maaga said the company’s prices for the new year are announced before 1 April. “The price of DStv Premium in South Africa compares favourably with the pricing in other African countries,” said Maaga. To establish how DStv prices in South Africa compare with other African countries, MyBroadband did a basic comparison of 3 popular packages. The table below shows the price of DStv Premium, DStv Compact, and DStv Access on various countries across the continent. It shows that Nigeria offers the most affordable DStv packages while the DRC and Ethiopia have the highest prices.
