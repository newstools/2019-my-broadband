The Netflix Netherlands Twitter account has accidentally leaked the release date of the upcoming Witcher TV series. In a now-deleted tweet, Netflix listed the number of “sleeps” until a range of new content appeared on the platform. This list included The Witcher, which Netflix said would launch in 97 days from when the tweet was published. If this date is correct, then The Witcher should launch on Netflix on 17 December 2019. Netflix Netherlands quickly deleted the tweet, but not before many users captured a screenshot of the published dates. The Witcher TV series will be based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and will star Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia. This leaked release date follows after Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos confirmed to Variety that the show would launch before the end of 2019. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319931" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Netflix-Witcher-leak.jpg" alt="Netflix Witcher leak" width="640" height="463" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Netflix-Witcher-leak.jpg 865w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Netflix-Witcher-leak-553x400.jpg 553w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Netflix-Witcher-leak-768x556.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Netflix-Witcher-leak-594x430.jpg 594w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
