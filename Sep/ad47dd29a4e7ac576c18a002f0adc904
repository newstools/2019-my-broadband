Facebook has announced a new partnership with various entities – including MIT, Microsoft, and the University of Oxford – to fight deepfakes. The company will invest over $10 million in an initiative called the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC), which seeks to create open source tools that can be used to discern between deepfakes and legitimate videos. “The Deepfake Detection Challenge will include a data set and leaderboard, as well as grants and awards, to spur the industry to create new ways of detecting and preventing media manipulated via AI from being used to mislead others,” said Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer. Schroepfer said it will commission a realistic data set for the project by using paid actors. He added that no Facebook user data will be used in the project. The launch of the DFDC will take place at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) in December.
