The Vivaldi web browser is now available on the Google Play Store in a mobile beta version. Vivaldi was created by developers who had previously been part of the Opera development team, and is designed to appeal to power users thanks to its highly customisable experience. The mobile version of Vivaldi will allow users to use “search engine nicknames” to swap between search engines when typing in the address field – such as “d” for DuckDuckGo and “w” for Wikipedia. Users will also be able to sync their bookmarks, Speed Dials, passwords, autofill information, and other information between desktop and mobile versions of the browser. However, certain features available in the desktop version are not available on mobile, such as the ability to group tags into a “tab stack.” At the time of writing, the beta version of the mobile browser had been downloaded over 10,000 times.
