A 17-year-old boy from the UK has gone blind and deaf due to a diet consisting of only junk food. Sky News reported that that teenager had “lived off a diet of chips, crisps, white bread, and processed meat”. His poor diet – which deprived him of essential vitamins and minerals found in vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and dairy – began several years ago, and when the boy was 14 he complained to doctors of “tiredness”. “Tests showed that he had low vitamin B12 levels and macrocytic anaemia. It was said the ailments had been brought on by him being a fussy eater,” stated the report. He was given B12 injections and dietary advice, but when he returned one year later his condition was worse – with his hearing and vision impaired. By 17, his vision had deteriorated into blindness. It was then that the boy admitted since primary school he had only ever eaten French fries, Pringles, white bread, processed ham slices, and sausage. Further tests on him revealed vitamin B12 and D deficiencies, reduced bone mineral density, and low levels of copper and selenium. This resulted in his nervous system being damaged, and the vision and hearing impairments.
