MTN Nigeria has shut down all of its stores and service centres in the country due to targeted anti-South African attacks on its facilities, reports Reuters. Facilities in three Nigerian cities were attacked in response to days of xenophobic riots in South Africa, targeting foreign-owned businesses from countries including Nigeria. “The safety and security of our customers, staff and partners is our primary concern,” MTN Nigeria said in a statement. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has reportedly instructed his foreign affairs minister to initiate discussions with South Africa’s high commissioner regarding the xenophobic riots. These xenophobic riots have been met with condemnation by other African countries. Several countries will no longer attend the World Economic Forum on Africa which is set to be hosted in South Africa, while the Zambian national soccer team has cancelled its match against Bafana Bafana that was set to take place this Saturday. MTN Group has released a statement condemning the recent xenophobic attacks. It confirmed that four of its MTN outlets in Nigeria have been attacked, and that it has closed all of its stores and service centres in Nigeria as a precaution. MTN added that it has also closed some of its Johannesburg stores. “MTN is working with the relevant authorities and other stakeholders to focus on stabilising the situation both in Nigeria and South Africa and to ensure the safety and well-being of all those impacted by the unfortunate violence,” said MTN. “We are also looking at coordinating with key stakeholders to work on medium to long term interventions to this situation.”
