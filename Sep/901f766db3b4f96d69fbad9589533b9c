DStv has provided insight into what caused its DStv Now service to experience downtime during the Springboks versus New Zealand rugby world cup match today. “We would like to apologise to some of our DStv Now customers who were unable to access the platform for the Springbok RWC match against the All Blacks,” said the company. “All customers that were logged in ahead of the start of the match were able to view the game seamlessly, however, there was a problem with the influx of fresh logins on the platform, which had to be individually verified, causing a delay in accessing the platform.” Multiple social media users complained that they were unable to watch the game on DStv Now, with several stating they missed the entire match as a result. Other users said they were forced to “make a plan” elsewhere to watch the game. DStv said its engineering team has been “working tirelessly” ahead of the rugby world cup to ensure “preparedness for a record number of online viewers”. “Our DStv Now app goes through a series of checks during a user’s login to verify the user, their password, package, etc. This verification process is quite critical to ensure that our customers are able to have access the platform for their entertainment requirements.”
