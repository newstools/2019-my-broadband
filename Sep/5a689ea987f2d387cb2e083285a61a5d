YouTube will not ban politicians for breaking the company’s content rules. This is the position of YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, as stated during an open interview at The Atlantic Festival in Washington D.C. on Wednesday. “When you have a political officer that is making information that is really important for their constituents to see, or for other global leaders to see, that is content that we would leave up because we think it’s important for other people to see,” Wojcicki said. According to Politico, Wojcicki believes that it is necessary to keep certain controversial content up to provide context for the general public, as it will likely be covered by the news media. Wojcicki also remarked that YouTube allows some videos to violate its rules if they are considered to be artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific. The statements follow similar comments by Facebook’s global affairs chief Nick Clegg at the same event on Tuesday. Contrary to these approaches, Twitter announced in June this year that it would label and demote tweets that violate its terms of use. Social media platforms are increasingly pressured to act on inflammatory comments made by prominent political figures, including those made by US President Donald Trump.
