Apple Arcade is now available on the South African App Store with iOS 13, and is priced at R84.99 per month. The iStore announced the launch, stating that South African users can now access an all-new way to enjoy games. “Apple Arcade allows users unlimited access to the entire catalogue of over 100 new, exclusive games, all playable across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, and Apple TV,” said iStore. Apple Arcade is launching with a one-month free trial, and users will not find this selection of games on any other mobile platform or subscription service. Apple Arcade games can also be played offline. A single subscription includes access for up to six family members with Family Sharing. This service was first unveiled at Apple’s iPhone 11 launch event, where Apple said the game streaming platform would be available for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. Users can access the entire library of Arcade games on the App Store by paying a monthly subscription fee, and new games will be added every month. The Arcade tab in the App store includes recommendations, game trailers, and editorial content such as game guides. Compatible products include the iPod Touch, iPhone 6s and above, and the Apple TV.
