Apple has revealed a new 7th-generation 10.2-inch iPad which boasts a bigger display and improved features compared to previous-generation devices. The device is powered by Apple’s A10 Fusion chip and includes a smart connector for an optional full-size keyboard that also acts as a protective cover. The 10.2-inch 7th-generation iPad runs iPadOS 13, which enables a number of desktop-like features that work seamlessly with the device’s smart keyboard. This 7th-generation iPad is made of 100% recycled aluminium and includes advanced cameras in addition to all-day battery life. “The new iPad was built to run iPadOS, which introduces powerful new ways to multitask, manage and mark up documents, use Apple Pencil and view more information at a glance on a redesigned Home screen,”  said Apple marketing vice president Greg Joswiak. “This new iPad with iPadOS takes everything people love about our most popular iPad and makes it even better for creating, learning, working and playing.” Apple said that the new iPad is now available for order from $329 for the Wi-Fi model and $459 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model. The device will begin shipping at the end of September, and the Smart Keyboard is available for purchase separately for $159. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319613" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPad-7th-gen-1.jpg" alt="iPad 7th-gen 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPad-7th-gen-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPad-7th-gen-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPad-7th-gen-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319615" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPad-7th-gen-2.jpg" alt="iPad 7th-gen 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPad-7th-gen-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPad-7th-gen-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPad-7th-gen-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
