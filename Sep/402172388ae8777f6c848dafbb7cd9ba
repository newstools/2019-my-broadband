Apple announced its latest range of iPhones on 10 September. The new series consists of the iPhone 11 (the more affordable option) and the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. The iPhone 11 Pro will cost $999 for the 64GB version, the same price as that of its 2018 predecessor – the iPhone XS – at release. Some notable components of the iPhone 11 Pro that have been improved since the iPhone Xs are the processor, battery, and camera. According to Apple, the iPhone 11 Pro’s A13 Bionic chip is the world’s most powerful smartphone chipset, delivering up to 20% better CPU and GPU performance than the A12 Bionic chip in the iPhone Xs. The A13 contains over 8.5 billion transistors and can perform up to one trillion operations per second, delivering improved machine learning capabilities. It also utilizes hundreds of voltage domains, meaning the different parts of the chip are switched on and off as they are needed, making it more power-efficient. Apple says the higher-efficiency chipset in the iPhone 11 Pro uses 15% less power compared to the older A12 Bionic processor. This results in up to four hours longer battery life for the iPhone 11 Pro when compared to the iPhone XS. The battery size for the iPhone 11 Pro has also been increased to 3,190mAh from the 2,658mAh in the Xs, according to leaked specifications. Total battery life will now amount to 18 hours of video playback, 11 hours of video streaming, or 65 hours of audio playback. Apple has also introduced a new three-camera system for the Pro. The device boasts ultra-wide, standard wide, and telephoto lenses, each with a 12MP sensor. The latter enables 2x optical and 10x digital zoom for photos. The new system is also better at shooting in low-light conditions and the 12 MP front camera supports slow-motion video capture. Apple’s iPhone 11 range will go on sale in South Africa on 26 September. Local pricing is still to be announced.
