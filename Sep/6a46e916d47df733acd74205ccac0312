Lenovo recently unveiled its new lineup of Yoga and ThinkBook laptops at IFA 2019, boasting powerful new hardware and impressive designs. The company has even bigger plans for its future hardware, however, including a full-screen foldable laptop and the world’s first 5G PC. Lenovo’s 5G laptop – codenamed Project Limitless – was built in partnership with Qualcomm and was unveiled in May 2019, although it currently has no official release date. Neither does Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 foldable laptop, which the company said is not a tablet or a hybrid, but a “fully-fledged laptop with a foldable screen”. Speaking to Lenovo global consumer marketing vice president Matt Bereda at IFA 2019, MyBroadband asked about the company’s ambitious hardware projects and its strategy for growing its global market share. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307802" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Project-Limitless.jpg" alt="Project Limitless" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Project-Limitless.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Project-Limitless-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Project-Limitless-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Bereda said that a 5G-enabled PC would open up new possibilities for VR and AR applications as well as extremely fast file transfers. “We’re proud to have unveiled a preview of the world’s first 5G PC on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx 5G compute platform earlier this year,” Bereda said. “Real 5G in a PC will satisfy people’s need for speed – from faster file transfers and streaming in 4K, 8K and even augmented or virtual reality, to higher quality video calls on-the-go, faster screen refreshes for mobile gaming, and many more use cases.” “Lenovo’s excited to bring this limitless connectivity of 5G to consumers in a PC form factor for fast productivity,” he said. Lenovo is expected to provide more information regarding the general availability of this device in the near future. Bereda also reiterated that Lenovo’s foldable laptop was not a smartphone replacement, but was instead a complementary device for fans of portable, powerful laptops. “Earlier this year, Lenovo showed how we’re pushing the boundaries of foldable innovation by unveiling a preview of the world’s first foldable PC,” Bereda said. “It’s an innovative space-saving form factor specifically designed for highly mobile, tech-savvy professionals and technology lovers who demand the best tools that combine laptop performance and productivity with smartphone portability to fold into their lifestyles.” “It is not intended to replace smartphones that serve a different user need and we view the two kinds of devices as complementary.” Lenovo has seen impressive growth in the global PC market, with one in four PCs sold worldwide bearing the Lenovo logo. “Last quarter, our PC and smart devices business went from strength to strength in a recovering market, with record profit, double-digit revenue growth and highest ever global PC market share where one in four PCs sold is a Lenovo PC,” Bereda said. “Lenovo is also the fastest-growing PC player among the top five.” “As always, we have been growing our business amid a tough competitive landscape and stay committed to growing our PC market share across consumer, commercial and small-medium business (SMB) segments,” he said. Lenovo’s product range encompasses a variety of products, and Bereda said the company has a clear growth strategy which focuses on segments including workstations, gaming, visuals, thin and light PCs, and Chromebooks.
