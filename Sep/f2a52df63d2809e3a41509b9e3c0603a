Frogfoot announced that it has acquired the existing network and customer base of Blitz Fibre, entering into a partnership with the company to accelerate its fibre rollout. Blitz Fibre builds fibre infrastructure in multi-dwelling residential and business complexes, and has a presence in Gauteng, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. “Frogfoot encountered Blitz in Port Elizabeth and Richards Bay, and instead of duplicating the fibre network, we decided to partner with them instead,” said Frogfoot Networks CEO Abraham van der Merwe. “We were impressed with the Blitz team’s ability to secure and build multi-dwelling units and their ability to scale in such a short space of time and this was one of the key drivers of the acquisition.” He noted that the transaction includes the acquisition of Blitz Fibre’s network and existing customer base, but not the company itself. Going forward, Blitz Fibre will continue to operate independently, and will acquire and build multi-dwelling units for Frogfoot on an exclusive basis. “The acquisition will see another 15,000 homes being passed by Frogfoot, bringing our total homes passed to 102,000 as of August 2019,” van der Merwe said.
