Google is planning to add support for its Stadia game streaming service to its Android TV platform, XDA Developers reports. The company unveiled its Android TV roadmap for 2020 and 2021 at the International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam, and a slide of the presentation sent to XDA Developers confirmed that Google would add Stadia integration to the operating system next year. Google Stadia currently requires users to own a Chromecast Ultra to be used with a TV, but this will change as part of an Android 11 update to the Android TV platform next year. Other big changes coming next year include the possible launch of a new Android TV device with smart home features. The leaked slide also showed that Google plans to roll out a Play Store refresh for Android TV this year, as well as to begin testing home screen and in-stream advertisements. Google’s Stadia cloud gaming platform will feature a number of high-profile titles at launch, including Mortal Kombat 11, Borderlands 3, Destiny 2, and DOOM Eternal. CD Projekt RED’s upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 role-playing game will also launch on the Stadia platform next year. Google Stadia is expected to go live in November 2019. The Founder’s Edition package is priced at $129 and includes three months of Stadia Pro with a limited-edition Night Blue controller.
