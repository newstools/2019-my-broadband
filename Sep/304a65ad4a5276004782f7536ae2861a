Google has published a tweet teasing its upcoming Play Pass gaming subscription service for Android. This service is a direct competitor to Appleâ€™s Arcade platform, and previous leaks have suggested that Play Pass will be priced at $4.99 per month. Like Apple Arcade, Play Pass will include ad-free access to a large library of mobile games in addition to premium applications. Possible titles which could be available on the service at launch include Monument Valley, Stardew Valley, and Marvel Pinball. All of the games included in Play Pass will not include any microtransactions, and the company may also offer a free 10-day trial to new users.
