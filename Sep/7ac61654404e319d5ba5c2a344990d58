Apple recently launched its new iPhone range, which includes the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max, and Technomobi is taking pre-orders. Favourite features of the new iPhones are the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max camera systems, as well as hardware improvements implemented across the range. The new dual-camera in the more affordable iPhone 11 and triple-camera system in the Pro models captures more of what you see and love, while the high‑quality video functionality makes your memories look better than ever. Another highly acclaimed feature is the A13 Bionic chip, which offers superior performance and integrated machine-learning features. Pricing for each new iPhone device available from Technomobi are listed below. All iPhones in the new range will be available for purchase from 27 September in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-320657 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11a-640x298.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="298" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11a-640x298.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11a-600x280.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11a-768x358.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11a.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> When buying a new smartphone, you need accessories to go with it.
