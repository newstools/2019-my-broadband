Apple recently launched its new range of iPhones, including the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max – which it claims are the “most powerful and advanced smartphones” ever made. These new iPhones offer various improvements over their predecessors, including an updated camera system and a new A13 Bionic processor. The iPhone 11 Pro has tough competition, however, as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Huawei P30 also offer high-end performance and flagship features at attractive prices. We compared the specifications and features of these three premium smartphones below. While the iPhone 11 Pro range uses Apple’s newest operating system, iOS 13, the Galaxy Note 10 and Huawei P30 both use Android. The Galaxy Note 10 and Huawei P30 both have Android 9 installed, but the P30 is scheduled to be updated to Android 10 later this year. Google has said it will roll out Android 10 to various smartphones in the coming months, meaning the Note 10 could also be upgraded to Android 10 soon. All three devices use 7nm processors, and Apple claims that its A13 Bionic processor is substantially faster than its competitor’s chips. However, Samsung’s Exynos 9825 and Huawei’s HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipsets also offer impressive performance – meaning that you are unlikely to be disappointed regardless of which device you purchase. The Galaxy Note 10 and 10+ offer 8GB and 12GB of RAM respectively, which is superior to the P30 and P30 Pro’s 6GB and 8GB of RAM. Apple has not disclosed the amount of RAM present in its iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Plus smartphones. In terms of storage, the Note 10 and 10+ both offer up to 256GB in South Africa. The Huawei P30 only offers up to 128GB, while the P30 Pro model available in South Africa has 256GB of internal storage. Both of Apple’s new iPhone 11 Pro smartphones will have up to 512GB of storage. When it comes to biometric security, both the Huawei and Samsung smartphones boast under-display fingerprint sensors and facial recognition software, while the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Plus include an improved version of FaceID. The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max sport a camera system with a 12MP wide lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens. All three of these lenses are capable of shooting 4K 60FPS video, and the combination of these three lenses allows for 2x optical zoom. Apple’s camera system also uses Filmic Pro to allow users to shoot video with both the rear and front cameras at the same time. Both the Note 10+ and P30 Pro offer similar camera systems, but with an additional fourth lens that is used to provide extra depth and focus. The Note 10 and 10+ also support live bokeh effects for video recording, as well as a built-in video editor and night mode for the front camera. Huawei’s P30 and P30 Pro use Leica camera systems with a variety of impressive features, such as 50x digital zoom and AI-powered object recognition. The Galaxy Note 10+ and Huawei P30 Pro have the two best smartphone cameras available on the market according to DxOMark, and are separated by a single rating point. The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max have not yet been tested on this platform. Below are the specifications and pricing of the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+, and the Huawei P30 and P30 Pro. Official US pricing and direct dollar-to-rand conversion are provided for the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, as local pricing has not yet been disclosed. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319669" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-vs-P30-vs-Note10_-640x412.png" alt="iPhone 11 Pro vs P30 vs Note10_" width="640" height="412" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-vs-P30-vs-Note10_.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-vs-P30-vs-Note10_-600x386.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319671" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-Max-vs-Huawei-P30-Pro-vs-Note-10-640x412.png" alt="" width="640" height="412" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-Max-vs-Huawei-P30-Pro-vs-Note-10.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-Max-vs-Huawei-P30-Pro-vs-Note-10-600x386.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
