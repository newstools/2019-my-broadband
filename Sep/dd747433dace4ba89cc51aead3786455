Google has sent out an invitation for its upcoming Made By Google event, where it will launch its latest Pixel smartphones. The company has already published a placeholder for the event’s live stream on YouTube, which is scheduled to begin on 15 October 2019. It is expected that Google will launch new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL devices, which will include unique features previously unseen on Google’s flagship handsets. Google has already confirmed a number of features which will be implemented on the Pixel 4, including Motion Sense and Face Unlock. Motion Sense employs Soli radar hardware at the top of the Pixel 4, allowing users to control media playback and various other functions by waving their hand over the smartphone. “These capabilities are just the start, and just as Pixels get better over time, Motion Sense will evolve as well,” Google said. “Motion Sense will be available in select Pixel countries. ” A report by 9to5Google has also stated that the Pixel 4 will have some impressive specifications, including OLED displays with 90Hz refresh rates. The devices could also feature dual-lens camera systems, as well as 6GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 855 chipset. Google may launch additional hardware at its Made By Google event, with some speculating that a new smart speaker might be unveiled by the company.
