Apple has launched iOS 13.1 – the first official update to its recently-released iOS 13 operating system. The release of iOS 13.1 is a week ahead of Apple’s initial schedule, which had originally stated that the update would go live on 30 September. The new version of Apple’s operating system offers a fix for a security flaw identified last week which allowed attackers to bypass the lock screen of iPhones running iOS 13. It also offers features that weren’t ready to launch alongside the initial release of the operating system, including Automations within Shortcuts and Share ETA, which allows users to share their estimated time of arrival with their friends and contacts. The new update also includes optimised battery charging, which slows the rate of battery ageing by decreasing the time iPhones spend fully charged. It also offers new HomeKit icons and a specialised volume indicator for certain headphones and earphones – such as AirPods and Beats headphones. Apple has also rolled out iPadOS 13.1 – the dedicated operating system designed specifically for iPad usage. It offers most of the features available within iOS, as well as some specialised functionality designed specifically for the large display of the iPad. This includes improved multitasking, smaller app icons, and pinned widgets.
