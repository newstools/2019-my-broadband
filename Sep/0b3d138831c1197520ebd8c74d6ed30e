SpaceX is preparing for a flight test of its Starship Mk1 spacecraft, according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk. The company has filed a communications request with the FCC for a suborbital flight and recovery test for the Starship vehicle. The initial test for the spacecraft will see it reach an altitude of 12.5 miles (20km) before returning to the launch pad. SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft is a fully-reusable space vehicle which will form part of the company’s BFR rocket in addition to functioning as a standalone rocket for orbital missions. The company hopes to launch its first commercial Starship mission in 2021.
