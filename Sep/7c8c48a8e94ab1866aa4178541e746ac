DStv is the only TV platform in South Africa which will broadcast the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan – after the SABC could not reach an agreement with SuperSport for broadcasting rights. With the popularity of rugby, the 2019 Rugby World Cup is expected to be a widely-watched event in the country. So prominent is the tournament that MultiChoice launched a DStv Premium Rugby World Cup deal, which offers a big discount to lure former subscribers back to the service. “Come back to DStv Premium before 20 September 2019 and pay just R750pm (instead of R904pm) to enjoy the Rugby World Cup like never before,” said the company. While many MyBroadband readers are DStv Premium subscribers, the majority of people who plan to watch the 2019 Rugby World Cup are not DStv subscribers. A recent MyBroadband poll revealed that nearly three-quarters of those planning to watch the tournament do not have a DStv Premium subscription. The most popular alternative is to use a friend of family member’s DStv Premium account to stream the games on DStv Now. 21% of users said they will stream the 2019 Rugby World Cup through an international online platform. These platforms include Rugbypass and iTV. Around 17% of people plan to watch the games in a social setting like a friend’s house, a pub, or a restaurant. The chart below, based on a MyBroadband survey, provides an overview of how people say they will watch the 2019 Rugby World Cup. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-318729" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Graph.jpg" alt="DStv Graph" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Graph.jpg 953w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Graph-600x336.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Graph-768x430.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DStv-Graph-640x359.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
