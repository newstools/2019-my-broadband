Volkswagen recently revealed its new logo, which has a simple and flat design that is a stark departure from the three-dimensional logo used for the past two decades. The company’s new logo will officially debut on its ID.3 electric hatchback and will roll out to its full vehicle lineup by the middle of 2020. VW said the flat design of the new logo is clearer, with the logo itself being reduced to its essential elements. “The brand design and the logo aim for high flexibility and are intended for digital applications,” the company said. Volkswagen was first founded in 1937 as part of the German initiative to provide citizens with affordable automobiles, and the company’s first logo comprised the VW initials within a stylised cogwheel that was surrounded by swastika wings. The logo saw a major evolution in 1945, taking on a simpler, more circular design and gaining fame due to its appearance on popular cars such as the VW Beetle. Various adaptions of this logo with different colour and style variations followed over the next few years (including a square design), until VW made a major change to its logo once again. In the year 2000, VW adopted a three-dimensional logo with realistic and shaded colours, further enhancing the depth of the shape in its 2012 redesign. This is the logo present on most vehicles today which has now been replaced by the darker blues and simpler layout of the 2019 logo. Below are pictures of every Volkswagen logo through the years: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319463" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-1937.jpg" alt="VW
