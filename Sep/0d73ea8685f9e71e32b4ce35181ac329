To support the ever-increasing capacity needs of channel partners, ISPs, WISPs, telcos, OTTs and Content Providers, WIOCC – the leading player in the deployment of carrier-scale, future-proofed network infrastructure into Africa – has recently upgraded the core of its Johannesburg/Pretoria Metro Network to support multiple 100Gbps of capacity. With a 10Gbps Access Layer, WIOCC’s upgraded Metro network now offers even more scalable, high-quality, cost-effective internet and point-to-point connectivity solutions within the Jo’burg/Pretoria area and accommodates the needs of larger clients requiring 100Gbps hand-offs. <img class="size-full wp-image-320743 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/JNB-Pretoria-Metro-Diagram-June-2019.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/JNB-Pretoria-Metro-Diagram-June-2019.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/JNB-Pretoria-Metro-Diagram-June-2019-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/JNB-Pretoria-Metro-Diagram-June-2019-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> WIOCC CEO Chris Wood explained, “This 100Gbps upgrade is the latest example of WIOCC investing to create Africa’s first, truly hyperscale network infrastructure. Over the last 12 months, we have rolled out more than 1Tbps of backhaul capacity across South Africa to ensure that we are able to meet future data volume demands of end-users throughout the country.” Wood continued: “Our focus on building and maintaining strong, long-term relationships with each client, coupled with our ongoing commitment to network investment, means we are able to develop bespoke solutions that not only meet clients’ current requirements, but also have the scale and flexibility to match future demands for growth, extra resilience and geographical expansion.” WIOCC’s investment in deploying a 45-PoP (Points of Presence) Jo’burg/Pretoria metropolitan area infrastructure delivers direct access, over a highly redundant network, to more than 2,000 client premises across 95 business parks and numerous shopping malls in Johannesburg and Pretoria. The Metro network also enables clients to connect two or more sites on the same layer 2 ethernet network, via a managed, dedicated, point-to-point or point-to-multipoint ethernet connectivity offering – at speeds from 20Mbps up to 100Gbps. <img class="size-full wp-image-320745 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/WIOCC-Globe-NETWORKS-APRIL-2019.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/WIOCC-Globe-NETWORKS-APRIL-2019.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/WIOCC-Globe-NETWORKS-APRIL-2019-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/WIOCC-Globe-NETWORKS-APRIL-2019-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Operating exclusively as a wholesaler, WIOCC revolutionised the delivery of high-capacity connectivity between Africa and the rest of the world and is now widely recognised as Africa’s carriers’ carrier.
