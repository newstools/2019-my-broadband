Apple has announced the new Apple Watch Series 5, featuring a new always-on retina display. Previously, when you lowered your wrist, the screen went off, but now it will just go darker – allowing you to still tell the time. When you tap your watch face, the display will light up as it did on previous Apple Watches. This new always-on retina display is powered by what Apple claims is the industry’s only low-temperature polysilicone and oxide display (LTPO), along with an ultra-low-power display driver, efficient power management integrated circuit, and new ambient light sensor. Apple said the Apple Watch Series 5 will continue to offer 18-hour battery life despite the fact that the watch face will permanently remain on. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319579" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Apple-Watch-5-638x430.png" alt="Apple Watch 5" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Apple-Watch-5-638x430.png 638w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Apple-Watch-5-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Apple-Watch-5-593x400.png 593w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Apple-Watch-5-768x518.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Apple-Watch-5.png 816w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Apple Watch Series 5 will run watchOS and offers a variety of new health features, including: The Apple Watch 5 will also include a built-in compass, which is integrated into the updated Maps app and can be added to your watch face to view your direction at a glance. It will also have a dedicated compass app that will display and track your heading, incline, latitude, longitude, and elevation. Apple has added new safety features such as its updated emergency SOS function, which offers international emergency calling in over 150 countries – even without your iPhone being nearby. This feature also works with fall detection, which means that if it is enabled, it will automatically place an emergency call if you take a fall and remain motionless for a minute. “We’ve seen Apple Watch have a meaningful impact on our customers’ lives and we’re excited to deliver even more capabilities with Apple Watch Series 5 and watchOS 6,” said Apple COO Jeff Williams. “The seamless integration of new hardware and software delivers an enhanced experience that makes it even easier to stay active and connected to the people and information users care about.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319569" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Watch-5.png" alt="Watch 5" width="640" height="644" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Watch-5.png 787w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Watch-5-397x400.png 397w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Watch-5-768x773.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Watch-5-427x430.png 427w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Apple Watch 5 will come in a variety of materials and colours: There will also be Nike and Hermes versions of the Apple Watch Series 5 which will include new bands, loops, and faces.
