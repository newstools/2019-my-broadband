Acer has unveiled a new Thronos gaming station, called the Predator Thronos Air Gaming Chair. The Thronos Air follows the original Thronos from Acer, and will cost $13,999 in the USA. Acer has modified the chair in comparison to its predecessor, and removed the motorization of the monitor arm in the Air. The Thronos Air will still let users mount three PC monitors, though, and retains the adjustable mouse and keyboard tray. It must be noted that the Air does not come with monitors, peripherals, or a gaming PC.
