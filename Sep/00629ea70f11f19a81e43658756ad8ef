Volkswagen has unveiled its new tweaked logo at the Frankfurt car show which will debut officially on the ID.3 electric hatchback. The new two-dimensional VW logo replaces its three-dimensional blue-and-silver logo it launched two decades ago. The company said the flat logo design is clearer and has been reduced to its essential elements. The VW emblem has looked similar since World War II and the latest iteration is in line with the minimal changes seen in the past. “This world premiere marks the start of a new era for Volkswagen,” the company said in a press statement. “With its new brand design, VW has created a uniform global 360° brand experience which is more modern and more authentic.” “The brand design and the logo aim for high flexibility and are intended for digital applications,” the company said. Volkswagen said the new logo will roll out to its full vehicle line-up by the middle of next year. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319359 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW2019-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW2019-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW2019-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW2019-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW2019-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW2019.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319367 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-logo-1-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-logo-1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-logo-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-logo-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-logo-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319369 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-logo-explained-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-logo-explained-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-logo-explained-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-logo-explained-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-logo-explained.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319361 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-VW.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319365 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-ID3-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-ID3-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-ID3-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-ID3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/VW-ID3.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
