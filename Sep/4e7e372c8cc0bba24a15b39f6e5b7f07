Amazon launched a variety of new devices at its 2019 hardware launch event yesterday. Some of these devices were new iterations of already-existing products, but many brand new gadgets were also unveiled. Here are five of the coolest new Amazon Echo devices. The Echo Buds are Amazon’s answer to Apple’s Air Pods, and signal Amazon’s first attempt to compete in the wireless earphone market. They use dual armature drivers to offer great sound and will last for five hours of continuous use. The case included with the Echo Buds can charge them, and the Echo Buds can last for up to 20 hours when housed within this case. The Echo Buds will work with Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri, and retail for $129. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321287" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds.png" alt="" width="640" height="370" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-600x347.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321289" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="472" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-3.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-3-542x400.png 542w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-3-583x430.png 583w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321291" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="504" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-2-508x400.png 508w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-buds-2-546x430.png 546w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Amazon Smart Oven offers traditional microwave capabilities as well as convection cooking and air frying.

It uses a haptic engine for notifications and has two microphones so that you can communicate with Alexa. It is made of titanium and will be priced at $129, although it is also only available by invitation. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321299" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop.png" alt="" width="640" height="439" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-583x400.png 583w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-627x430.png 627w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321301" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="516" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-3.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-3-496x400.png 496w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-3-533x430.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321303" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="518" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-2-494x400.png 494w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Loop-2-531x430.png 531w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Echo Flex is the smallest Echo speaker Amazon has launched. It is a simple speaker system with a microphone that allows you to speak with Alexa. It is designed to be easy to install and small enough that it can be used almost anywhere in your home or workplace – as long as there is somewhere to plug it into your power. It is priced at just $25, although it will cost an additional $14 if you want to include a motion sensor and night light. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321277" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex.png" alt="" width="640" height="539" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex-475x400.png 475w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex-511x430.png 511w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321273" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="516" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex-3.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex-3-496x400.png 496w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex-3-533x430.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321279" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex2.png" alt="" width="640" height="518" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex2-494x400.png 494w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/echo-flex2-531x430.png 531w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
