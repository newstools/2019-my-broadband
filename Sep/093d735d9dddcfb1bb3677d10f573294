Cool Ideas has stated on its website that it experienced a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack on its network today. “We are currently experiencing a distributed denial of service attack that is affecting all customers on our network’s international traffic,” the ISP said this afternoon. “Customers will experience intermittent connectivity loss and degraded performance to any international service/site during this time.” Cool Ideas said its engineers were working to mitigate the attack and hoped to restore connectivity soon. No time frame was provided for how long the issue could take to resolve. This is the second DDoS attack which has affected the ISP in recent weeks. On 11 September, Cool Ideas was hit by a DDoS attack which affected its ability to provide a stable Internet connection to its customers.
