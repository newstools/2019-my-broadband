Microsoft may be working to bring back its popular “Sets” feature to Windows 10, as discovered by serial leaker Walking Cat, who said that Sets could return in Windows 10 Build 19841. The inclusion of the feature in this build means that Microsoft could launch Sets for Windows 10 in the first half of 2020, although it would first be available to testers through the Windows 10 Insider Programme. Sets is a feature aimed to improve productivity by implementing a feature similar to browser tabs in the operating system itself, allowing users to group certain tasks or programs into collections of tabs within a new window. The feature was previously available for testing, but Microsoft pulled it from its Windows 10 Insider builds after deciding to make some additional changes. Sets previously ran on Microsoft Edge, and now that Microsoft plans to launch a new Chromium-based browser for Windows 10, the overhauled feature would need to be implemented within this software. The company has not confirmed whether Sets will release next year, but the inclusion of the feature in build 19841 points to an initial release in the Windows 10 20H1 update. Users who have signed up to the Windows 10 Insider Programme would be among the first to try out the new feature, provided it is implemented in this update.
