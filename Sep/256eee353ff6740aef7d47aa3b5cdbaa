AMD has announced that its 16-core, 32-thread Ryzen 9 3950X processor has been delayed until November. The Ryzen 9 3950X was originally slated to launch this month at a cost of $749. According to AMD, this delay is due to the high demand for the parts required to build the Ryzen 9 3950X, and the company wants to ensure that there is enough stock at the time of launch. “We are focusing on meeting the strong demand for our 3rd generation AMD Ryzen processors in the market and now plan to launch both the AMD Ryzen 9 3950X and initial members of the 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen Threadripper processor family in volume this November,” said AMD. “We are confident that when enthusiasts get their hands on the world’s first 16-core mainstream desktop processor and our next-generation of high-end desktop processors, the wait will be well worth it.” The Ryzen 9 3950X will be the most powerful of AMD’s third-generation CPUs. AMD’s third-generation CPUs offer superior gaming performance than the company’s previous-generation chips across both 1080p and 1440p resolutions. The Ryzen 9 chips also offer up to 58% better performance-per-watt than the previous-generation, while the Ryzen 7 range offers up to 30% better performance-per-watt.
