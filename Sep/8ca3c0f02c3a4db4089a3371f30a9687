Microsoft released a cumulative update for Windows 10 on 10 September which is quickly turning into a nightmare for users. The update included three key changes which aim to improve security, patch vulnerabilities, and address CPU usage issues for certain processes. A list of problems discovered by Softpedia News shows that this update has caused a variety of issues for many users, however, with Microsoft only acknowledging two known issues on its update page. Microsoft states that users may experience audio issues in certain PC games, problems with Input Method Editor, or issues with the Start menu launching after installing this update, but users have reported a swathe of other problems with their systems after updating to the latest version of Windows 10. These issues include a PIN login error, which sees the PIN login prompt failing to appear when authenticating in Windows Explorer. While there is a danger of being affected by these errors, failing to install cumulative updates could leave your system open to recently-discovered vulnerabilities. This follows reports of the previous Windows 10 cumulative update causing performance issues for many users due to high CPU usage. The disproportionate resource consumption was caused by a problem in the “SearchUI.exe” process, an issue which Microsoft said it has fixed in its latest cumulative update.
