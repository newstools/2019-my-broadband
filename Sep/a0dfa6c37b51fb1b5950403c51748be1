Apple recently launched its new iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max devices, refreshing its lineup of flagship smartphones. The devices launched in the United States last week, and reviews of the new handsets have now begun to flood in from international publications in the US and Europe. Apple has published a collection of reviews on its website outlining the favourite features of its new iPhones from users around the world. Praise for the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max camera systems was widespread among reviewers, and users also greatly enjoyed the hardware improvements implemented across the range. The A13 Bionic was highly-acclaimed thanks to its superior performance and its integration with machine-learning features. In addition to praise for the smartphone lineup’s new features, many reviews also cautioned against buying the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max over the iPhone 11 for no good reason. The Verge labelled the iPhone 11 as the device most people should buy due to its greater value compared to the more expensive Apple handsets. Many reviewers also noted that while the new smartphones offer an improvement over the previous generation, they do not necessarily provoke an immediate desire to upgrade. They include better specifications and camera systems, but they also share many design and hardware features with the previous-generation iPhone Xs and even the iPhone X. Below is a summary of the best iPhone 11 features according to reviewers from around the world, collated by Apple. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320427" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-1-1.jpg" alt="iPhone 11 Pro 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-1-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-1-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-1-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> iPhone 11’s Night mode is great. It works, it compares extremely well to other low-light cameras and the exposure and color rendition is best in class, period. [iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max] are some of the most well-balanced, most capable phones Apple — or anyone — has ever made. They have excellent battery life, processors that should keep them relevant for years to come, absolutely beautiful displays and a new camera system that generally outperforms every other phone, which should get even better with a promised software update later this fall. Apple’s deep software paired with the camera hardware is what sets the iPhone 11 Pro cameras apart and makes zooming between the three cameras feel so smooth. The best new feature here is Night mode, which pretty impressively brightens dark photos … it’s automatic in low-light settings. You can even use it as a flashlight. When you shine it at something dark, the screen will display it with more light than you can see with your own eye. And this time, Apple made the deal even sweeter. Thanks to some under-the-hood improvements, a new camera and its $699 starting price, you’re getting more of what matters for slightly less. The iPhone 11 represents a big leap forward for photography, thanks to a new ultra-wide lens and a new Night mode for better low-light performance. Apple has also upped the ante with greater video-recording quality while also delivering superb battery life. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319595" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4.jpg" alt="iPhone 11 Pro 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-Pro-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> For the video-takers of the world, all three iPhones will let you record 4K video at 60 frames per second. That’s some crisp, high-res stuff with impressively smooth motion. And the editing tools Apple gives you let you alter, chop and correct video just like you would a photo. Another cool feature lets you transition cleanly from a photo-taking scenario to a video-taking scenario. These cameras work together to capture portrait pictures, which I still love to use for snaps of my dog, Mabel. Lots of other cameras do this now, but Apple remains one of the best at getting it right. The top-tier iPhone has finally arrived. Just like the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro before it, this is the one that’ll get things done and then some. I’m pretty confident that in day-to-day use it’s the best smartphone camera on the market. The A13 Bionic isn’t just faster than the competition, it wipes the floor with them. Using the phone’s camera was easy and intuitive, and with the integration of the advanced A13 Bionic chip and iOS 13, as well as machine learning, photography on the iPhone just gets better.
