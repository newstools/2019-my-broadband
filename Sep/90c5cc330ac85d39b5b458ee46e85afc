The Internet Service Providers’ Association (ISPA) announced that it has introduced a Fellowship Programme with the aim of improving South Africa’s ICT skills base. ISPA chair André van der Walt said that emigrating industry professionals and the current ICT skills gap in South Africa threaten the country’s participation in the fourth industrial revolution. ISPA has been involved in several of South Africa’s Internet industry-related developments. It founded the country’s first Internet exchange point (INX-ZA) in Johannesburg in 1996 and has been running an IT skills training programme for teachers since 2000. According to Van der Walt, both experienced independent Internet professionals and newcomers to the ICT industry are welcome to join the programme. He added that membership access is not limited to those living within South Africa’s borders. “Anyone in the world can apply to become an ISPA Fellow, which means that skilled South Africans living elsewhere can potentially play a helpful role with regards to the skills base of their home country,” van der Walt said. ISPA describes the benefits of becoming a fellow as follows: Applications for membership to the Fellowship Programme are reviewed on a monthly basis. An annual membership fee of R1,200.00 (excl. VAT) is applicable. ISPA may choose to waive this fee under certain circumstances. To apply to become a fellow, complete the application here.
