The woman who drove with a Gauteng Traffic Police officer on the bonnet of her car was arrested for resisting arrest and reckless driving. This is according to a statement from the Gauteng Department of Community Safety. News of the 27 year-old woman’s arrest comes after a video of her driving with the traffic officer on top of her car was shared on social media. According to the Gauteng Department of Community Safety, the incident happened in Krugersdorp on 13 September. However, the video only became widespread on 17 September. The video shows an Audi driving at some speed while the traffic officer holds onto the front of the car, demanding that the driver stop. A white minibus can be seen pursuing the Audi, cutting it off after overtaking it. The Gauteng Traffic Police confirmed that it was one of their unmarked vans giving chase. A bystander filmed the video from the passenger side of their vehicle as they drove past the scene. Yusuf Abramjee tweeted the video on the afternoon of 17 September. It is embedded below.  The Gauteng Department of Community Safety stated that the traffic officer was busy issuing the driver with a traffic fine for using her cellphone while driving. The driver decided to make a break for it and the officer tried to stop her. “The driver was immediately arrested for failing to comply with an instruction of a traffic officer, reckless driving, and resisting arrest,” the department said. “A fine was also issued for driving while on a cellphone.” The Gauteng Traffic Police has said that it “eagerly awaits” court proceedings. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320387" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gauteng-Traffic-cop-on-Audi-bonnet-stopped.jpeg" alt="" width="452" height="273" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320389" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gauteng-Traffic-cop-on-Audi-bonnet-arrest.jpeg" alt="" width="499" height="401" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gauteng-Traffic-cop-on-Audi-bonnet-arrest.jpeg 499w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gauteng-Traffic-cop-on-Audi-bonnet-arrest-498x400.jpeg 498w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 85vw, 499px" /> Photos supplied by @GTP_Traffstats on Twitter.
