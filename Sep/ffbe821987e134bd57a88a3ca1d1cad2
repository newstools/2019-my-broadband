You then receive three options: Face Recognition was first introduced in December 2017, but it was only available to a limited number of users. Those who have not had Face Recognition available as a setting will receive a notification in their News Feed that will allow them to turn the feature on. If they choose not to, however, Face Recognition will remain disabled by default.
