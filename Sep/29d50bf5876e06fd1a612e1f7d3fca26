Lenovo announced two new smart tablets and a smart display at its Tech Life event at IFA 2019 in Berlin, Germany. The new product lineup included the Yoga Smart Tab, the Lenovo Smart Tab M8, and the Lenovo Smart Display 7. Each of these devices offers integration with smart assistants as well as a range of entertainment and productivity features. By adding Google Assistant to its new tablets, Lenovo said the devices are able to double as smart home hubs in addition to standard entertainment devices. Lenovo’s new smart display and tablets are detailed below. The Yoga Smart Tab is the successor to the Yoga Tab 3 series, pairing smart home hub features with standard tablet functionality. It includes a kickstand which allows users to position the screen in whichever configuration they choose, as well as improved audio hardware to deliver better sound than ever before. Sporting a 10.1-inch Full HD IPS display and Google Assistant’s Ambient Mode, the Yoga Smart Tab can be everything from a handheld screen for your favourite movies to a voice-controlled hub for your smart home. The Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab will be available in October 2019 and will be priced at €149. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-318869" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Yoga-Smart-Tab-1.jpg" alt="Yoga Smart Tab 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Yoga-Smart-Tab-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Yoga-Smart-Tab-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Yoga-Smart-Tab-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Smart Tab M8 includes a charging dock and voice command support, allowing to act as a smart speaker when charging or a standard tablet.
