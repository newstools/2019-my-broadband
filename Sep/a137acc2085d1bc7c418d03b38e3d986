Alaris Holdings, a leader in the defence antenna technology market, has shown excellent growth over the last year. Under the leadership of CEO Juergen Dresel, Alaris designs and manufactures some of the best antennas in the world. Its products are used in communication, frequency spectrum monitoring, test and measurement, electronic warfare, and other specialised markets. The company’s clients are mostly international organisations based in the United States, Europe, and Asia, where Alaris has a reputation for providing high-quality and reliable products. Alaris released its results for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 which showed strong revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased by 31% from R187.1 million to R245.2 million while profit after tax increased by 25% from R32.9 million to R41.1 million. Basic earnings per share and headline earnings per share increased by 21% from 28.35 cents to 34.29 cents. Despite this strong financial growth, the company’s share price decreased steadily over the past year. This, former Poynting CEO Andre Fourie argues, is due to the “convoluted historical numbers and fact that few journalists and analysts are interested in spending much time on analysis of such a small-cap company.” The chart below shows the Alaris share price in 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321177" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Alaris-Share-Price.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="300" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Alaris-Share-Price.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Alaris-Share-Price-600x281.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
