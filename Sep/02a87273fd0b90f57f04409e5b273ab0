No longer content with being just in driveways, Lexus is coming for the docks of the super rich. The Toyota Motor Corp. division debuted the LY 650 on Thursday, its first yacht. The 65-foot beast is the realization of a concept boat Lexus first showed in January 2017. The yacht is a floating amalgam of Japanese craftsmanship, Italian design and American manufacturing. It’s being built in collaboration with Marquis Yachts in Pulaski, Wisconsin, which adopted the famed Toyota Production System. Italian yacht-design studio Nuvolari Lenard worked with Lexus on the living-space layout, including three bedrooms each with their own showers. “The LY 650 symbolizes the challenge taken by Lexus, which aspires to be a true luxury lifestyle brand, to venture beyond the automobile,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in a statement. “I am truly looking forward to seeing the advanced, high quality LY 650 display its beauty on the oceans across the globe.” Sales start Oct. 30. While Lexus hasn’t yet released a price, an executive said last year the boat will be comparable to others in its class. Sunseeker’s 66-foot Manhattan goes for about $3 million. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-320725 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LY-650-640x359.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LY-650-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LY-650-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LY-650-768x431.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LY-650.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-320729 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-640x359.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-640x359.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-768x431.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-320731 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-1-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-1-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-320733 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-2-640x422.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="422" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-2-640x422.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-2-600x396.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-2-768x507.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lexus-LY-650-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
