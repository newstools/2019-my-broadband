You can now easily play classic Nintendo games on your iPhone or iPad. A new app store called AltStore allows for the installation of emulator applications on devices running iOS 13. AltStore was developed by Riley Testut and is currently available in a preview version with a full release coming on 28 September. For now, the only available application on AltStore is Testut’s Delta Lite, a console emulator that supports NES games. Testut says the full version of Delta will feature support for SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo 64 games. According to 9to5Mac, the interface appears similar to what the App Store looks like. Apple is restrictive about installing software that allows console emulation, and users would normally have to jailbreak their devices to run emulation software, which would void their device’s warranty and create a security risk. However, Testut’s application does not require the bypassing of Apple’s software, but instead uses an application testing tool used by app developers. 9to5Mac said the AltStore “tricks the device into thinking it’s installing apps made by yourself”. To get the application, a user needs to firstly download and install the AltServer from altstore.io on their PC or Mac and connect the device they wish to install the AltStore on with a USB cable. Then, the user needs to open the program, click on “Install AltStore”, and select their device. After entering Apple ID credentials, the app will appear on the device’s home screen. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321259" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Altstore.jpg" alt="Altstore" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Altstore.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Altstore-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Altstore-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
