WeBuyCars recently moved their first official branch, Silver Lakes, to bigger and better premises, providing the second-hand car trading company with more space and their customers with easier access. While trading at the new branch commenced on 1 August, the company hosted an event on 4 September 2019 to officially open the branch. The original WeBuyCars Silver Lakes branch was built in 2010 with capacity to house 100 cars. Only six months later, the company acquired the land next door to the warehouse due to heavily increasing storage demands. “Because of our rapid growth in a very short time, the warehouse soon proved to be too small once again and we realised that further expansion was imminent,” said Faan van der Walt. It was then decided to move the branch to its new location, which is still in the Silver Lakes area, on the corner of Solomon Mahlangu Drive and Bendeman Boulevard. According to WeBuyCars, the new location allows customers easy access from both the N4 highway as well as the surrounding neighbourhoods within Pretoria East, and has the capacity to house 800 cars. WeBuyCars now boasts eight branches and 17 buying pods, which have been erected in locations across the country. Photos of the launch are below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-318817" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6967.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6967.jpg 2016w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6967-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6967-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6967-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6967-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-318835" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6976.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6976.jpg 2016w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6976-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6976-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6976-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6976-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-318819" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6968.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6968.jpg 2016w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6968-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6968-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6968-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6968-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-318821" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6969.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6969.jpg 2016w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6969-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6969-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6969-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6969-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />   <img class="aligncenter wp-image-318833" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6975.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6975.jpg 2016w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6975-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6975-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6975-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6975-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-318831" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6974.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6974.jpg 2016w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6974-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6974-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6974-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6974-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  <img class="aligncenter wp-image-318827" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6972.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6972.jpg 2016w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6972-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6972-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6972-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_6972-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
