Apple has launched its new iPhone 11 smartphone, which boasts an overhauled design and a powerful camera system. The new device sports a dual-lens camera on the rear and retains the notched front display present on previous-generation devices. Apple said the iPhone 11 is IP68 rated for water resistance up to 2 metres for 30 minutes, and boasts the toughest glass ever implemented on a smartphone. The iPhone 11 is powered by the Apple A13 Bionic processor, the next-generation chipset that Apple claims offers up to 20% improved CPU and GPU performance when compared to the A12. Apple said the A13 is the fastest CPU and GPU ever included in a smartphone, yet the phone delivers one hour more battery life than the iPhone Xr. Other new features include Wi-Fi 6, wireless charging, and faster Face ID, and is available in six colours: Purple, White, Yellow, Green, Black, and Red. “With the tight integration between hardware, software and services, the advancements in iPhone 11 bring an unparalleled user experience at an affordable price to even more customers,” said Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller. The iPhone 11 features a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display which extends across the entire front face of the smartphone, and its dual-lens camera comprises two 12MP lenses that enable stereoscopic depth. The ultra-wide lens on the iPhone 11 boasts 2x optical zoom, and the camera app interface now overlays the main lens’ field-of-view over the ultra-wide image for easier switching between photo modes. Apple has also implemented various software changes to its camera which allow for dynamic depth control and exceptional night photography. The iPhone 11 supports 4K video capture at 60 frames per second with support for slow-motion, time-lapse, and dynamic range. Apple said that the iPhone 11 delivers the highest-quality video ever in a smartphone. The front camera has also been updated to feature a 12MP TrueDepth camera and 4K video support. Apple said the iPhone 11 will be available from 20 September 2019 for the following prices: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319589" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ipHone-11-533x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="516" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ipHone-11-533x430.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ipHone-11-496x400.jpg 496w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ipHone-11-768x619.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ipHone-11-1200x968.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319593" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-pic.jpg" alt="iPhone 11 pic" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-pic.jpg 1632w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-pic-400x400.jpg 400w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-pic-768x768.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-pic-430x430.jpg 430w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-pic-1200x1200.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319599" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-water-resistant-640x360.png" alt="iPhone 11 water resistant" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-water-resistant-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-water-resistant-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-water-resistant-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-water-resistant.png 816w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-319601" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-gaming-640x360.png" alt="iPhone 11 gaming" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-gaming-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-gaming-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-gaming-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-gaming.png 816w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
