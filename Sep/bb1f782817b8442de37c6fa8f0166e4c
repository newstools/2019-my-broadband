The iPhone 4’s notable metal frame design could make a comeback in next year’s Apple iPhone. According to MacRumors, the prediction was made in the latest research note written by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has previously made accurate predictions regarding Apple products before their release. “The metal frame and the front and rear 2/2.5D glass are still used, but the metal frame surface will be changed to a similar design to the iPhone 4, replacing the current surface design,” Kuo said. The original iPhone 4 design featured an exposed square-edged aluminium frame wedged between two sheets of reinforced glass. The device’s form factor was infamously known for causing a loss in cellular connectivity when held in a certain way, and Apple had to ship free cases to customers to help resolve the issue. Kuo has said that the new design will minimize any possible negative effects of the metal shielding on the internal antenna’s high-frequency transmission capability, thanks to the grooving and injecting of the metal into the frame. He further said that next year’s iPhones will likely have support for 5G and previously predicted the two 2020 OLED versions will boast 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch displays.
