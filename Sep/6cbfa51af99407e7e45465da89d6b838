Axxess has launched its new Telkom fixed LTE products, which comprise month-to-month SIM-only packages with prices starting at R99 per month. Axxess’ Telkom fixed-LTE capped data packages include anytime data plus a free night surfer data allocation. They also include free SIM delivery, and there is an option to include a ZTE LTE router with the subscription. The table below provides an overview of the new Telkom fixed-LTE products from Axxess. Axxess’ new fixed-LTE products come after Telkom has started to discontinue ADSL products across the country. Telkom is moving ADSL customers to newer technologies in an effort to save maintenance costs on its ADSL network and offer customers a better service. In areas where there is no fibre connectivity, the plan is to move current ADSL and VDSL subscribers to fixed-LTE. Fixed-LTE is not susceptible to problems like cable theft and offers higher average speeds than ADSL. Many ISPs, including Webafrica, MWEB, and Axxess have now launched their own Telkom fixed-LTE products which should make the migration process easier.
