Rain CEO Willem Roos has confirmed to MyBroadband that the company has no intention of discontinuing its popular unlimited off-peak product. Rain recently announced on its website that its popular R250 unlimited off-peak plan, which offers uncapped data for 19 hours per day, would be discontinued on 30 June 2019. The company then revised this decision shortly afterwards, however, and decided to continue to offer the service to new and existing clients after June. Rain’s chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga told MyBroadband that the company’s new tariffs would only be introduced when it launches 5G later this year. Current unlimited off-peak subscribers will continue to enjoy the service after Rain introduces these new tariffs. It was, however, expected that the R250 unlimited off-peak plan would disappear when the new products were unveiled. The good news for fans of Rain’s unlimited off-peak plan is that it is here to stay. “Whilst we cannot guarantee the price point ad infinitum, we have no plans to change that in the near future,” Roos told MyBroadband. Roos added that the 4G unlimited off-peak plan would continue after the launch of the company’s 5G offering. The timeline for Rain’s commercial 5G launch remains relatively uncertain, with the company initially scheduling the rollout for September 2019. In a recent response to questions from MyBroadband, however, Rain said this launch date could not be confirmed with certainty.
