Apple’s next-generation iPhone could lose the notch entirely, according to leaked images posted by Ben Geskin on Twitter. Geskin has a good track record with Apple hardware leaks, and stated that he received this information from a source in China. The notch on the iPhone 11 houses the manufacturer’s Face ID facial recognition system, which is the only biometric authentication system on Apple’s new smartphones, as they do not have a fingerprint sensor. According to the leak, the Face ID camera array will be shrunk down for the next generation of iPhone, to the point where it can be housed entirely within the screens top bezel – eliminating the large notch at the top of the device. “One of the 2020 iPhone prototypes has 6.7-inch display with Face ID and TrueDepth camera system housed in the top bezel,” Geskin tweeted. This hardware is still in a prototype phase, meaning the design could change drastically before the next iPhone is released to the public. It is unclear whether Apple will include an in-screen fingerprint sensor on its next generation of devices, as is common on flagship smartphones from Android competitors. Apple recently launched its new lineup of iPhone 11 devices, which feature a similar design to the previous-generation iPhone Xs while adding an extra camera lens to the rear of the device and sporting an upgraded A13 Bionic chipset. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-321606" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-no-notch-640x360.jpg" alt="iPhone no notch" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-no-notch-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-no-notch-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-no-notch-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-no-notch-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
