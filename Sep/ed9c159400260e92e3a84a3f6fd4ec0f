Xiaomi has revealed its latest concept smartphone, the Mi Mix Alpha. The handset features a unique “Surround Display” design, which sees the screen wrap around the sides and rear of the device, offering what is essentially a dual-display configuration. As its display wraps around to the rear of the chassis, the Mi Mix Alpha does not have any side buttons. Instead, the sides of the display are pressure-sensitive and use a linear motor to simulate the touch of physical buttons. Xiaomi has placed a vertical sapphire glass strip on the device’s rear display that houses the primary camera, which Xiaomi said boasts the highest resolution, highest pixel count, and the largest sensor ever implemented in a smartphone. This camera is capable of producing photos with a resolution of 12,032 x 9,024 and includes a number of features which improve low-light shots and video stabilisation. The main camera functions both as the primary and selfie camera, with users simply flipping the smartphone around and using the same camera system together with the rear screen to take selfies. The Mi Mix Alpha is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ chipset and includes 5G network support. It also boasts 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage, as well as a 4,050mAh battery with 40W fast charging. Xiaomi said it would begin small-scale production of the Mi Mix Alpha at the end of the year, adding that the device would be priced at around R42,000. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-321103" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Xiaomi-Mi-Mix-Alpha-4.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Xiaomi-Mi-Mix-Alpha-4.jpg 2000w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Xiaomi-Mi-Mix-Alpha-4-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Xiaomi-Mi-Mix-Alpha-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Xiaomi-Mi-Mix-Alpha-4-573x430.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Xiaomi-Mi-Mix-Alpha-4-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
