Huawei has launched its new Mate 30 Pro premium smartphone, which will run Android 10. The device boasts a quad-lens camera system which is housed in a circular area in the middle of the back panel and comprises a 40MP wide-angle lens and 16MP ultra-wide lens, as well as an 8MP telephoto lens and a time-of-flight depth sensor. Huawei has implemented its new “Horizon” display design on the Mate 30 Pro, which features a display panel that curves all the way around the front of the smartphone. It retains the same notch as the previous-generation Mate 20 Pro which houses a 32MP front-facing camera and the hardware necessary to facilitate Huawei’s Face ID 2.0 facial recognition feature. While Google previously confirmed that the Mate 30 Pro would not have licensed Google apps, Huawei has still implemented its EMUI 10 operating system on its new smartphone. This version of the operating system lacks official Google apps such as Chrome, YouTube, and Gmail at launch, although these could still theoretically be side-loaded onto the device by users. The Huawei Mate 30 Pro boasts the most advanced camera system ever implemented in the manufacturer’s smartphone hardware. This camera system delivers the ability to take ultra-slow-motion videos as well as exceptional low-light and zoom shots. The Horizon display on the Mate 30 Pro has no physical volume buttons. Instead, you can simply double-tap on the edge of the screen to manipulate the volume slider. Huawei’s Mate 30 Pro also supports 40W wired charging and 27W wireless charging paired with an impressive 4,500mAh battery. The device also features a gesture sensor integrated into the notch at the top of the display, which allows you to control your smartphone via hand movements in front of the display. The HiSilicon Kirin 990 chip in the Mate 30 Pro offers impressive CPU, GPU, and AI processing power, as well as an integrated 5G modem. It is important to note that the Kirin 990 is available in two versions – one with 5G capabilities and one without. The full specifications of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro are listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320609" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-2.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 30 Pro 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Huawei also launched its Mate 30 smartphone along with the Mate 30 Pro device. The Mate 30 is a slightly larger version of the Mate 30 Pro with a smaller battery but a similar display design and camera specifications. Huawei also unveiled its Mate 30 RS device in collaboration with Porsche Design, which is a luxury version of the Mate 30 Pro with a leather-backed chassis and a square rear camera module. This premium version of the Mate 30 Pro boasts an impressive 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage, along with an integrated holding strap to prevent accidental drops. This Mate 30 Series will be available internationally from October 2019 at the following prices. Additionally, the Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro will both be available in a “Vegan Leather Edition”, which features an environmentally-friendly faux-leather rear panel. Huawei has not yet confirmed the local launch dates and pricing for these smartphones. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320617" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-3.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 30 Pro 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320621" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-4.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 30 Pro 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320623" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-5.jpg" alt="Huawei mate 30 Pro 5" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-5.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-5-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Huawei-mate-30-Pro-5-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
