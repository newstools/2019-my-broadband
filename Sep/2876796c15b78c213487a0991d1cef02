Black Friday 2019 takes place on 29 November, and South Africans can look forward to great specials from local retailers this year. While Black Friday is an American tradition, local retailers have now adopted this tradition. Black Friday is particularly popular among ecommerce players and it is now the biggest online shopping day in South Africa. While many online retailers focus their energy on Black Friday only, others like Takealot and Makro have deals on multiple dates. Brick-and-mortar stores like Checkers, Game, and Clicks are also expected to attract consumers with specials on everyday products. The 2018 MyBroadband Black Friday survey revealed that PC hardware, electronics, and clothing were the most popular purchases last year. The survey further revealed online retailers were by far the most popular channel among tech-savvy consumers, with consumers spending thousands on the day. 51% of respondents said they only shopped online, while 28% said they shopped online and at brick-and-mortar stores. 21% said they shopped at brick-and-mortar stores only. TVs were particularly popular last year. GfK South Africa’s data showed that TV sales increased by 66% to over 93,000 units on Black Friday 2018 compared to the year before. Additionally, retailers sold 29,000 TVs in the week after Black Friday – evidence that Black Friday deals are extending in duration. Takealot said its annual Blue Dot Sale generated record sales on Black Friday, with R11.5 million in sales within the first hour. The total transaction value for Black Friday 2018 on Takealot amounted to over R196 million – a 125% year-on-year growth in sales and 127% growth in orders. 68% of shoppers buying Black Friday deals on Takealot placed orders on their mobile phones via the Takealot app and mobile site. Takealot CEO Kim Reid said electronics proved to be a firm favourite, with over three thousand TVs sold on the day. Best-selling items included perfume, camping gear such as folding tables, portable hard drives, and the DStv Explora decoder. Here are some of the prominent companies which are planning to participate in Black Friday this year. Takealot said it will definitely take part in Black Friday this year and has been prepping for its Blue Dot Sale already. “We’re super excited,” Takealot said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307228" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/takealot-header.png" alt="takealot header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/takealot-header.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/takealot-header-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/takealot-header-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> OneDayOnly said it will definitely participate in Black Friday 2019.
