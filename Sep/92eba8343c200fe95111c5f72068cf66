DStv has apologised to users of DStv Now – its online streaming service – for downtime at the start of the Springboks’ rugby world cup game against New Zealand. DStv stated on Twitter that it apologises for the inconvenience caused by the downtime. “Our tech team was informed of this issue and it was resolved,” it said. No explanation was provided as to what caused the downtime. Multiple social media users complained that they were unable to watch the game on DStv Now, with several stating they missed the entire match as a result. Other users said they were forced to “make a plan” elsewhere to watch the game. The latest downtime follows a similar incident in May, where DStv Now was down for hours on a Sunday. This prevented users from viewing high-profile sporting events like the Premier League’s final matches. “This is due to the optimization that’s currently being done to improve the overall viewing experiences,” the company said at the time.
