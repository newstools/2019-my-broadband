Apple is working on sleep tracking for the Apple Watch, and could announce the feature next week, reports 9to5Mac. According to the report, the new feature will allow users to track their sleep quality via various measurements, including their heart rate, noises they make, and movements. Apple will also add a feature that reminds users to charge their Apple Watch so that it lasts throughout the night – which will help those who usually charge their Watch while sleeping. The new sleep feature will also automatically turn of users’ alarms if they wake up and start their day before the alarm goes off. It is not yet clear whether the new Sleep features will be included on current versions of the Apple Watch, or will be exclusive to a new model.
