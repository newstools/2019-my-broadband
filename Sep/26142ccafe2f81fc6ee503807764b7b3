Apple recently launched its new iPhone 11 smartphone lineup, comprising the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Choosing between these devices can be a difficult decision, especially considering the significantly higher price tag but greater specifications of the iPhone 11 Pro. Apple’s iPhone 11 is the successor to the iPhone Xr, which the company launched last year as a “more affordable” option compared to the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. The iPhone 11 Pro is the latest flagship from the manufacturer, and is available in two models – the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro and 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max. We compared the specifications, pricing, and design of the new iPhone 11 lineup below to help South Africans decide which smartphone to buy. The biggest difference in terms of specifications is the camera system and display of each smartphone. Both the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max feature triple-camera systems which comprise a 12MP wide lens, 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens. In comparison, the iPhone 11 has only a dual-lens rear camera system with up to 2x optical zoom. The iPhone 11 does have various software features which improve the quality of its images compared to the previous-generation device, however. All new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro devices support 4K video capture at 60 frames per second with support for slow-motion, time-lapse, and dynamic range. The iPhone 11 has a 6.1-inch 1,792 x 828 LCD display, which offers great colour depth and brightness, but it is not nearly as impressive as the iPhone 11 Pro’s screen. Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max boast 5.8-inch (2,436 x 1,125) and 6.5-inch (2,688 x 1,242) OLED displays respectively. This panel type delivers the best contrast possible on smartphones, as well as improved battery life and greater colour depth. The full specifications of all three smartphone models are listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320357" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-vs-11-pro-1.jpg" alt="iPhone 11 vs 11 pro 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-vs-11-pro-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-vs-11-pro-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/iPhone-11-vs-11-pro-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> iStore South Africa recently listed pricing for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max, detailed in the table below: If you are happy sacrificing display quality and camera features while retaining power and a relatively large screen, the iPhone 11 is a great choice for shoppers on a budget. However, the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max both boast high-end specifications with great camera features, and are ideal for Apple fans who want the best possible display quality and design on offer. It should be noted that the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max each comes in a different size, and if you favour small smartphones, the best option for you would be the iPhone 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 Pro also includes more internal storage capacity than the iPhone 11, although this comes at a substantial extra cost.
