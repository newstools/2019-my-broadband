MyBroadband recently conducted its latest South African Fibre Survey, which revealed that there remains a strong demand for fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) in South Africa. The survey results further showed a decline in ADSL and VDSL connections, with FTTH and fixed-LTE showing strong growth. The survey was completed by 6,400 South African broadband users. People who completed the survey were typically IT professionals and tech-savvy consumers. The results are therefore representative of high-end broadband users in South Africa instead of the general population. [The full results of the survey are available to partner ISPs – please enquire here] The fibre survey results show that most tech-savvy consumers and IT professionals have fibre-to-the-home. Affordability remains the most important consideration, with a large number of FTTH subscribers opting for 10Mbps and 20Mbps connections. Uncapped packages dominate the fibre-to-the-home market, with over 80% of subscribers opting for uncapped data. The results showed that affordability, and therefore lower speeds, remain a big consideration for most fibre-to-the-home subscribers. An interesting finding is that there was a big shift in ISP popularity, with Afrihost surging ahead of other fibre ISPs. Afrihost’s strong performance may be linked to the launch of its uncapped and unshaped Pure Fibre products a few weeks ago. Most people who use ADSL, fixed-LTE, and mobile connections at home indicated that they would love to get access to fibre. This shows that the demand for fibre remains strong and there are still opportunities to roll out fibre networks in under-served areas. What is interesting to note is that Telkom is by far the most popular ISP among non-fibre users, but it does not perform nearly as well among fibre users. This clearly shows that people who move from DSL and fixed-LTE to fibre-to-the-home drop Telkom in preference of another service provider.
