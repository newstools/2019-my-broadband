Samsung has announced its new 8nm chipset – the Exynos 980 – which is positioned to become a popular chip for upcoming 5G smartphones. The Exynos 980 is Samsung’s first AI mobile processor that includes a 5G modem, said the company, which helps to reduce power consumption. Samsung’s VP of System LSI marketing, Ben Hur, said the Exynos 980 is set to bring 5G to a larger range of smartphones. “With the 5G-integrated Exynos 980, Samsung is pushing to make 5G more accessible to a wider range of users and continues to lead innovation in the mobile 5G market,” said Hur. The Exynos 980 supports the encoding and decoding of 4K UHD video at 120fps, offers HDR10+ support, and comes with a Mali-G76 GPU. Samsung expects mass production of the Exynos 980 to begin before the end of 2019.
