The University of Limpopo has terminated an employment contract with SABC board member Kgalema Mohuba, according to a report by City Press. Mohuba served as marketing and communications executive director at the university and was retrenched after being placed on precautionary suspension earlier this year. It is unclear whether the termination of Mohuba’s employment is related to an investigation started earlier this year which was based on anonymous reports that Mohuba had hired two Zimbabwean nationals to write his doctorate for him. “The university would like to thank Mohuba for his contribution to the institution during his tenure and wishes him everything of the best in his future career endeavours,” said University of Limpopo principal Mahlo Mokgalong. The university told City Press that it was unable to comment on the matter due to pending litigation. Mohuba has reportedly instructed his lawyers to challenge the decision, stating that the conduct of the university showed that it did not believe the allegations against him.
