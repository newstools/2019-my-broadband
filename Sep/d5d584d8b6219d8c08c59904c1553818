The Huawei Mate 30 Pro may still run EMUI 10 – Huawei’s mobile OS built on Android 10 – despite Google’s confirmation that the device will not be certified to run Google apps. This is according to a list of specifications leaked by Slashleaks contributor @RODENT950 on Twitter. According to the leak, the Mate 30 Pro will run Android 10 without any Google apps installed. The alleged specifications also state that the device will have a rear camera system with four lenses, a 4,500mAh battery, and will be powered by Huawei’s Kirin 990 5G chipset. It is important to note that this leak is not confirmed by Huawei, and the Mate 30 Pro might ship with the company’s new Harmony OS installed instead. Huawei is expected to launch its Mate 30 Pro smartphone on 19 September 2019.
