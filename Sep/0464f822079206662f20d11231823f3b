Netflix and fibre is a common combination for South Africans. Fibre is much cheaper than ADSL and offers better speeds, making it ideal for users who want to stream all their entertainment. We have also already established that you can get Netflix and a fibre package for less than the monthly price of DStv Premium. Streaming services are often very efficient from a bandwidth perspective, and while speed is great for a fibre package, the data cap is more important for Netflix. Many great fibre packages are now offered as uncapped, which is ideal for Netflix subscribers as it allows them to watch as much as they like. When it comes to choosing a speed, Netflix recommends the following download speeds for its various resolution levels: This means that if you watch Netflix on a Full HD display, you only need a 5Mbps Internet connection to stream your shows – provided that nobody else is using your connection at the same time. If you have a 4K television, however, you will need a connection speed of 25Mbps. When comparing uncapped fibre packages in the speed brackets outlined by Netflix, we combined the cheapest packages available which would support both HD and 4K quality. Most ISPs offer packages starting from 8-10Mbps, which will easily support HD viewing. Many ISPs also offer 20Mbps and 40Mbps packages, which means only the latter would qualify to be sufficient for Ultra HD streaming. We compared some of the best fibre packages – available on the Openserve network – for streaming Netflix, below.
