A new update for Windows 10 released at the end of August has caused performance issues for many users due to high CPU usage. According to a report by Windows Latest, users who downloaded the Windows 10 KB4512941 update noticed that the operating system was using 30-40% of their CPU in the background. This resulted in greatly reduced performance across many systems, and users quickly narrowed down the problem to a Cortana-related process named “SearchUI.exe”. Some users found that disabling the “BingSearchEnabled” key in their registry resolved the problem, although a simpler option would be to simply uninstall the update. This can be done by navigating to the “Update & Security” menu under Settings, selecting “View update history”, and selecting “Uninstall updates” on the next screen.
