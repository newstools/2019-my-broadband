Although the reported launch of the 2019 version of the Motorola Razr never took place, new information from CNET claims the eagerly anticipated foldable phone should still make its debut by the end of the year. A person close to the company told the publication that the rebooted Razr would likely be unveiled before the end of 2019. CNET previously reported that Motorola had planned for an original launch date around the middle of this year. Motorola’s original Razr was a hugely popular device and also featured prominently on a number of US television shows and movies. Work on the latest iteration of the iconic smartphone has largely been kept under wraps, but leaked renders of the device surfaced online in April, showing a similar flip-phone design to that of its predecessor. The Motorola Razr 2019 could also feature a foldable OLED display across the front, which can be opened and closed vertically. It is set to compete against the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy Fold and the yet-to-be-released Huawei Mate X. Earlier reports put the release price of the phone at $1,500.
