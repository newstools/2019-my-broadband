MultiChoice has launched a DStv Premium Rugby World Cup deal which offers a big discount to lure former subscribers back to the service. Instead of paying the usual R904 per month for a DStv Premium subscription and Access Fee, the monthly price has been cut to only R750. “Come back to DStv Premium before the 20 September 2019 and pay just R750pm (instead of R904pm) to enjoy the Rugby World Cup like never before,” the promotional mailer reads. There are, however, a few provisos attached to the DStv Premium Rugby World Cup deal. The deal is not available to DStv Premium customers who are on a Price Lock contract, active DStv Premium subscribers, or disconnected customers that were last on a package other than DStv Premium. “Should a customer disconnect or downgrade or does not pay their account on time during the 2 months, they will not be able to reconnect again to the R750 offer,” MultiChoice said.
