The Courier Guy is launching a new smart terminal platform called PUDO (Pick Up Drop Off) to provide South Africans with more convenience and flexibility to send and receive parcels. PUDO makes use of smart lockers and a mobile app to make the delivery of packages easier for consumers. The Courier Guy’s Elmi Van Der Merwe told MyBroadband that the company’s aim is to place lockers throughout main city centres in the short-to-medium term. This network will then be extended to outlying regions as the adoption of the concept grows and becomes a trusted method for the distribution and collection of parcels. The Courier Guy is looking to launch an extensive network of PUDO Smart terminals throughout the country in the next 24 to 48 months. “We will have 1,000 lockers in total, of which 100 will be located in Gauteng and 900 nationally,” Van Der Merwe said. The Courier Guy will allow online retailers and other courier companies access to its PUDO network to ensure more flexibility and the best possible service levels. Van Der Merwe said the PUDO smart terminals make sending and collecting parcels an effortless exercise. Here is how it works: “All processes are completely automated. All the waybill details are completed via the app or web portal, thereby eliminating all the hassles of paperwork,” Van Der Merwe said.
