Tesla is hoping to reveal its new electric pickup prototype in November this year, according to a tweet by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk first mentioned that Tesla was working on a pickup truck design last year, and gauged interest over the product through Twitter. There is currently no information regarding the design or specifications of the Tesla pickup, but the company has previously said it will sport a “cyberpunk” design. Tesla has also said that the pickup will rival the Ford F-150 in carrying capacity and the Porsche 911 in performance. It should be noted that the November 2019 date projected by Musk may be subject to further delays, as has been common in the past.
