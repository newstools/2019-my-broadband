Huawei recently introduced a line-up of new products, including its range of Mate 30 smartphones. The devices offer new processors, better cameras, and larger batteries than the previous generation of Mate devices. Huawei says that the Mate 30 Series “unleashes the full potential of the smartphone”. The range includes the Mate 30 and flagship Mate 30 Pro, which set to compete with Apple’s recently launched iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. We compared these two premium smartphone ranges to get an idea of how their features and specifications measure up. The Huawei Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro come loaded with EMUI 10, based on the Android 10 operating system. The software does not have full support for Google’s services and applications, but features Huawei’s alternative app store, App Gallery. The iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro run on Apple’s iOS 13. Initial impressions of the new operating system have satisfied most, though Apple is rolling out iOS 13.1 on 24 September to address some minor bugs. In terms of biometric security, the Mate 30 series of phones have an in-display fingerprint sensor as well as facial identification recognition, while the iPhone 11 range comes with improved FaceID software. iPhone 11 smartphones boast an A13 Bionic processor, which Apple claims substantially outperforms all the competing smartphone chips. With 20% faster processing than its previous generation industry-leading A12 Bionic chip, it should beat the Mate 30’s new Kirin 990 in benchmark performance. This advantage will likely not be noticeable for average use, though. In a strict component-to-component comparison, the Mate 30 smartphones come out on top in almost all other areas. For example, the entry-level 128GB iteration comes with 8GB RAM, compared to the supposed 4GB in all storage configurations of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. The Mate 30 features a 4,200mAh battery, which Huawei says should easily last for one day’s use. The Mate 20 Pro is equipped with an even larger 4,500mAh pack.  Both devices support 40W wired fast charging and 27W wireless charging, as well as reverse wireless charging. Apple states that due to the efficient processing performance of the A13 Bionic, battery life has been improved on the entire range. An early review from Engadget puts the total battery life for the iPhone 11 at around 17 hours. Huawei has been dominating in the photography department, with its cameras offering some of the most impressive low-light shooting and zooming capabilities. Apple has updated its iPhone 11 camera systems to optimize low-light performance and add ultra-wide shooting, as well as solid zoom functionality. At face value, the Mate 30’s rear Supersensing triple camera system still outdoes the iPhone 11’s dual-camera setup. Where the iPhone 11 comes with a 12MP wide and 12MP ultrawide combination, the Mate 30 sports a 40MP wide, 16MP ultrawide, and 8MP telephoto lens. The latter provides for 3x optical zoom, 5x hybrid zoom and 30x digital zoom functionality. The higher-tier Mate 30 Pro has a rear quad camera system consisting of a 40MP wide, 40MP ultra-wide, 8MP telephoto and 3D depth sensor. The iPhone 11 Pro adds a 12MP telephoto lens for its triple-camera setup, allowing for 2x optical zoom. The iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro are set for release in South Africa on 27 September, with the 64GB versions priced at R14,999  and R21,999, respectively. The local launch date and pricing for the Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro are yet to be revealed. Below are comparisons of the specifications of the Huawei Mate 30 and iPhone 11 and the Huawei Mate 30 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-320983" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mate-30-vs-iPhone-11-640x403.jpg" alt="Mate-30-vs-iPhone-11" width="640" height="403" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mate-30-vs-iPhone-11-640x403.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mate-30-vs-iPhone-11-600x378.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mate-30-vs-iPhone-11.jpg 709w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320985" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mate-30-Pro-vs-iPhone-Pro-2.jpg" alt="Mate-30-Pro-vs-iPhone-Pro-2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mate-30-Pro-vs-iPhone-Pro-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mate-30-Pro-vs-iPhone-Pro-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mate-30-Pro-vs-iPhone-Pro-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
