Many viewers of the Apple iPhone 11 launch event may have glossed over the company’s marketing of the device’s new “slofie” feature, but Apple is dedicated to the name and has applied to trademark the term. This move was most likely made to protect the company’s marketing in the event that consumers take to the “slofie” terminology and it becomes a new trend. “Slofie” is a portmanteau of the words “slow” and “selfie”, and is the Apple-endorsed terminology for the slow-motion video features of the iPhone 11’s front-facing camera. “Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze,” Apple states under the “slofie” section of its iPhone 11 product page. The iPhone 11 can record video at 120 frames-per-second from its front-facing camera, which delivers slow-motion video when played back at a standard frame rate. The “slofie” trademark has been accepted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), but has not yet been assigned to an examiner. Apple has focused heavily on the iPhone 11’s camera features following the launch of the device, especially the added functionality of its rear camera system and integrated software features. Apple’s iPhone 11 range will go on sale in South Africa on 27 September. Local pricing is still to be announced.
