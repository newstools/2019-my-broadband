ASUS has unveiled prototypes of current ROG gaming laptops which use 1080p, 300Hz displays at IFA 2019, reports The Verge. The company plans on using this impressive display to create alternate versions of a number of its Strix and Zephyrus gaming laptops. “Paired with a GPU that produces enough frames per second to keep up, the faster display makes gameplay silkier than ever before,” said ASUS. The first laptop to get the new 300Hz display is the 17-inch ROG Zephyrus S GX701, which includes an RTX 2080 graphics card to cope with the higher frame rate. The 300Hz version of the GX701 will ship in October, and ASUS plans on adding the display to other powerful ROG laptops in 2020. ASUS also said that the 4K 120Hz display it showcased at Computex earlier this year is still set to be used for future devices.
