Apple has released iOS 13 for the iPhone, which packs a range of new features. “iOS 13 introduces a dramatic new look for iPhone with Dark Mode, new ways to browse and edit photos, and a private new way to sign in to apps and websites with just a tap,” said Apple. “iOS 13 is faster and more responsive with optimisations across the system that improve app launch, reduce app download sizes, and make Face ID even faster.” When tested by MyBroadband, iOS 13 was available locally and measured in at 2.04GB on an iPhone X. The new features in iOS 13 as described by Apple are listed below.
