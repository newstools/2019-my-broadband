The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) has released the official specification for 8K UHD TVs. Included with the specification is a logo which will signify whether a TV meets the requirements for official certification or not, making it easier for consumers to know whether they are buying a legitimate 8K display. The CTA said the 8K Ultra HD logo license and certification agreement will be available in the coming weeks, and the logo may be used starting from 1 January 2020. Displays must meet the following requirements to be classified as “8K” under the new specifications: “This 8K Ultra HD definition is the product of our Video Division Board’s dedication and hard work,” said CTA CEO Gary Shapiro. “As a result, retailers and consumers will know products that carry the accompanying logo deliver 8K UHD quality and performance.” The CTA projected that sales of 8K UHD TVs would reach 175,000 units in 2019, with continued growth expected in subsequent years. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320955" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8K-UDH-logo.jpg" alt="8K UDH logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8K-UDH-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8K-UDH-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8K-UDH-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
