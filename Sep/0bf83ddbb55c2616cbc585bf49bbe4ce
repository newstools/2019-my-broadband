“Did you receive our press release and are you going to publish it?” This is the number one question we receive at MyBroadband from PR agencies and companies. 95% of the time, the answer to that questions is: “Yes we received it, but we are not going to publish it.” There are several reasons the large majority of a company’s press releases go unpublished, as detailed below. At large online publications such as MyBroadband and BusinessTech, the journalists and editors receive 50-100 press releases per day on average. Priority on what is reported is given to important or breaking news involving the industry’s leading players. Many companies are doing great things and share their stories using press releases, with the aim of getting news coverage. Unfortunately, many of their competitors are doing or have done the same thing. If you are second or third to the party, it is unlikely your press release will get covered, as it is not newsworthy. Many companies get their PR agencies to send press releases to a publisher without even knowing who works there and what their focus points are. A company building a direct relationship with a publisher is important to ensure their news is not lost in the crowd. In the case of MyBroadband and BusinessTech, we do not have any relationships with PR agencies. We establish relationships with companies. The company then has the option to send their press releases directly to us, or through a PR agency. We are also happy to work with PR agencies once a company-publisher relationship has been established. The graph below shows you how not to send press releases to a publisher.
