There is excitement in the medical community after Chinese scientists employed the CRISPR gene-editing technique to fight HIV. While the patient, a 27-year-old man HIV-positive man, was not cured, scientists are upbeat about the potential of CRISPR. There is already a lot of research surrounding the use of CRISPR to cure diseases like cancer and even blindness, but to date, HIV has not been high on this list. The latest research shows that the CRISPR gene-editing technique can be used to safely make changes to the patient’s DNA. The changes were aimed at replicating a CCR5 gene variation which makes people naturally resistant to HIV. The experiment did not cure the patient of HIV, as only around 5% of his white blood cells – which the HIV virus attacks – were successfully modified with the CCR5 gene variation. The scientists are now looking at ways to increase the CCR5 gene variation to nearly 100%, which is what is needed to cure a patient of HIV. An abstract from the report in a scientific journal, titled “CRISPR-Edited Stem Cells in a Patient with HIV and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia” is provided below. The safety of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)–based genome editing in the context of human gene therapy is largely unknown. CCR5 is a reasonable but not absolutely protective target for a cure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, because CCR5-null blood cells are largely resistant to HIV-1 entry. We transplanted CRISPR-edited CCR5-ablated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into a patient with HIV-1 infection and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The acute lymphoblastic leukemia was in complete remission with full donor chimerism, and donor cells carrying the ablated CCR5 persisted for more than 19 months without gene editing–related adverse events. The percentage of CD4+ cells with CCR5 ablation increased by a small degree during a period of antiretroviral-therapy interruption. Although we achieved successful transplantation and long-term engraftment of CRISPR-edited HSPCs, the percentage of CCR5 disruption in lymphocytes was only approximately 5%, which indicates the need for further research into this approach. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-319939" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CRISPR-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="661" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CRISPR-1.jpg 883w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CRISPR-1-387x400.jpg 387w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CRISPR-1-768x793.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CRISPR-1-416x430.jpg 416w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
