International software company Micro Focus prematurely dropped its South African partner, Afrocentric, awarding the $25-million (about R366 million) contract to a company named X Telecoms instead. According to a report in the Sunday Times, Micro Focus told the State Information Technology Agency (Sita) that this move was made at the suggestion of deputy communications minister Pinky Kekana. This has resulted in the department of communications investigating the tender dispute and the deputy ministerâ€™s role in recommending that Micro Focus end its agreement with Afrocentric and switch to X Telecoms. Micro Focus initially signed a two-year contract with Afrocentric for the framework agreement between itself and Sita in November 2018, but eight months later this deal was terminated without cause and X Telecoms was selected as the new partner. Sita told the Sunday Times that no reasons were provided for the termination of the Afrocentric contract, and Afrocentric owner Luvo Gwiliza has asked Sita and the communications minister to intervene in the tender dispute. X Telecoms owner Khethi Nkosi argued that he started the process with Micro Focus months ago and has had a relationship with the company for years, stating that the deputy communications minister had no influence over the decision. According to the report, Kekana was a speaker at a Micro Focus conference in August 2019.
