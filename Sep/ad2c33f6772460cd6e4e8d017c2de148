CareerJunction has released its latest CareerJunction Index (CJI) report, which shows that there is an increase in the number of advertised IT jobs in South Africa. The CJI is based on data gathered from the CareerJunction website and monitors the labour market in South Africa by examining supply and demand trends. The latest CJI report shows that software development is the most sought-after skillset in South Africa. Hiring activity for software developers in South Africa increased by more than 20% since June 2019. There has also been an upward trend in the general IT jobs market over the last two months after a big decline over the last year. The demand for IT skills in South Africa is partly fuelled by a large number of IT professionals leaving South Africa. According to the website Where Did We Go, there has been a rapid increase in the number of South Africans who are leaving the country over the last two years. Many of the people leaving the country, the websiteâ€™s founder said, are software developers, IT professionals, and engineers. While this is bad news for the country, it is good news for IT professionals who stay in South Africa, as their skills are now in higher demand. The graph below shows volume trends for IT job adverts published on the CareerJunction website over the past 12 months. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320815" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ICT-Jobs.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ICT-Jobs.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ICT-Jobs-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ICT-Jobs-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
