MWEB recently launched new fibre packages, offering users discounted prices on the Openserve network. The new accounts offer clients on Openserve upload speeds multiple times slower than the download speeds. For example, the 100Mbps MWEB package comes with a 20Mbps upload speed – not the typical 50Mbps upload speed found on Openserve accounts. An MWEB representative on the MyBroadband Forum stated that the new fibre products were created to cater for the needs of a variety of clients – all at a reasonable price. “Not all clients require a high upload, as they just need the connection to download or stream. We still offer clients that want a higher upload, a package at a higher price.” For most users, this reasoning is sound – as uploads make up a small percentage of their Internet traffic. To see how MWEB’s new prices compared against competing ISPs, we have summarised their new packages in the table below. All accounts are uncapped and available on the Openserve network. As shown below, MWEB’s capping of upload speeds has seen its prices drop below competing packages with “normal” upload speeds.
