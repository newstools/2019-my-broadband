Google has announced that its Android 10 Go operating system is now available for low-end smartphones with limited specifications. Android 10 Go is a version of Google’s mobile operating system which is designed specifically for smartphones with 1GB of RAM or less and limited processing ability. The software includes lightweight versions of official Google apps found on the standard version of Android 10, and it also takes up less space on the device’s internal storage than the full version of the operating system. Optimised apps include Google Assistant, Gmail, Maps, Google Play Store, Search, Chrome, and YouTube. Android 10 Go features a number of improvements over the previous version of the lightweight operating system, including an improved File Manager app and a selection of new apps such as Gallery Go, Google Go, and Gboard. This operating system also includes a built-in data manager to help users reduce their mobile data usage, as well as support for Google’s Find My Device security feature. Google said that Android 10 Go will begin rolling out to various budget Android smartphones from several manufacturers this week. “With smaller app sizes, more storage space, and way more control over how your content is stored, it’s easy to see the ways Android 10 (Go edition) helps you save,” Google said. “Brand new apps designed for lighter updates and downloads help create more space while significantly improving performance. That’s what we call a win, win.”
