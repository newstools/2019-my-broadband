Tesla has published video footage of its Model S setting the fastest lap by a 4-door car at the Laguna Seca race track in California. The Model S, which was equipped with a prototype chassis and the manufacturer’s upcoming Plaid powertrain, recorded a time of 1:36.555 – about a second faster than the previous 4-door record. However, since the lap was not at a sanctioned event, the time is not considered an official record. Musk had previously said the Plaid powertrain would be exclusive to its upcoming Roadster, but has now said that it will also be available at an additional cost with its Model S and Model X vehicles. Watch the lap recorded by the Model S below.
