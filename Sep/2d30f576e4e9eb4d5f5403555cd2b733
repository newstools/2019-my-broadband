Telkom has sent out an alert which warns its subscribers about a scam which targets telkomsa.net email account holders. “A fraudulent email is being sent informing telkomsa.net email account users that their account was deleted,” Telkom said. This fraudulent email requests email account holders to complete a form to continue using their account. “Note this is a scam and not from Telkom,” the company said, adding that people who completed the form should immediately change their email password. “We recommend assistance to identify if there has been malicious damage to your device. For more contact abuse@telkomsa.net or call 10210,” Telkom said. Criminals often target Telkom customers in their scams due to the company’s prominent presence in South Africa. In a previous scam fraudsters pretended to be Telkom’s CEO and telephonically inform customers that Telkom’s banking details have changed. Customers were then asked to deposit their account payments into an alternative bank account which, unknown to the customer, belonged to the fraudsters. In another scam fraudsters deposited a stolen or counterfeit cheque into a customer’s account. Then, on a false Telkom letterhead, the fraudsters informed the customer that the initial deposit into their accounts was an erroneous refund from Telkom. The customer was then advised that the deposit amount needed to be transferred back to Telkom, but the account given to them was held by the fraudsters.
