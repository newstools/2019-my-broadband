The South African Police Service released its crime statistics today, which show that in the year to March 2019 there were 22,431 cases of robbery at residential properties. Dialdirect Insurance has warned that South Africans need to be vigilant to avoid becoming a victim of crime, and has suggested several steps homeowners can take to protect themselves. “Homes that aren’t thoroughly secured, have only one security measure in place, or have one of their security features temporarily disabled are prime targets,” said the company. Dialdirect noted the following trends when it comes to home robberies in South Africa. Dialdirect said homeowners must ensure they have the following defensive measures in place. Dialdirect added that homeowners must look out for suspicious vehicles or individuals, especially when entering their property. “Move swiftly when you enter or exit your property,” said the company. “Avoid giving criminals a peek at what is inside your home by leaving empty boxes of newly bought items in full view, by leaving curtains wide open or by leaving any doors, including the garage door, open,” it added.
