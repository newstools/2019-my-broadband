Google has begun rolling out Android 10 following months of testing. The operating system will support new technologies such as 5G and foldable smartphones, and also has over 50 new privacy and security changes. “Android 10 gives you greater protection, transparency, and control over your data,” said Google in a press release. “This builds on top of our ongoing commitment to provide industry-leading security and privacy protections on Android.” Other key features include a dark theme, improved gesture navigation, app timers for specific websites, and a Live Caption feature – which automatically captions your videos and audio files across all of your apps. Google has also included new enterprise features, such as allowing users to use different keyboards for their personal and work profiles. Android 10 will begin rolling out exclusively to Google’s Pixel smartphones today, and the company said it is working with various partners to upgrade other devices to Android 10 – as well as launch new devices with the operating system this year.
