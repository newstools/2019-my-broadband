Microsoft opened registrations for its Project xCloud game streaming service to applicants in the US, UK, and South Korea today. The company will send out invitations to participate in the platform’s public preview programme to a select few during a trial period in October. Project xCloud allows users to play Xbox One games on their mobile handsets via cloud streaming. The service will be facilitated by servers in Microsoft’s data centres that are equipped with Xbox One components. According to The Verge, the titles that will be available for testing are Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Killer Instinct, and Sea of Thieves. Microsoft has said it plans to add more games as the trial progresses. Potential testers will require a Microsoft account, a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One controller, and Android phone or tablet with Android 6.0 or above, supporting Bluetooth 4.0. Microsoft is one of several companies which are working on cloud-based game streaming services. Sony introduced game streaming for the PS4 on its PlayStation Now subscription service back in 2014, and Nvidia has been offering beta access to its GeForce Now streaming platform since 2015. Google will also launch its Stadia game streaming platform in November 2019.
