Research by DigiTimes shows that Intel’s CPU shortages will worsen in the second quarter of 2019. “With demand for Chromebooks to pick up and brand vendors to begin mass shipping their new models all using processors that are in tight supply, Intel CPUs’ supply gap is expected to grow,” said DigiTimes. The CPU shortages began in August 2018, when brands such as HP, Dell, and Lenovo experienced supply gaps of over 5%. While analysts expected the shortages to ease off ahead of the year-end holiday season, the gap stayed at similar levels in the fourth quarter of last year. CPUs with Kaby Lake R architecture and a quad-core design suffered the worst shortfall in this period, due to them being a significant part of Intel’s 2018 promotional campaign. This quarter, Coffee Lake processors are suffering the worst supply shortfall, while increased demand for Core i3 processors threatens to overtake Coffee Lake’s supply gap in the second quarter. Meanwhile, AMD’s market share in worldwide notebook shipments has grown from 9.8% in the first quarter of 2018, to 15.8% in the first quarter of 2019.
