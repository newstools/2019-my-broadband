Samsung has patented new technology for a TV that will let it work without any cables. The TV would use a wireless transceiver to power the TV, rather than a traditional power cable. The transceiver would be attached to the back of the TV, and would have a separate power transmitter send power to it. The patent was filed in March 2018, but was only released to the public in late February 2019. Samsung has focused on hiding wires connected to its TVs for years â€“ most notably with its OneConnect box for certain models which consolidates multiple cables into a single junction. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298468" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Wireless-TV-Patent.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Wireless-TV-Patent.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Wireless-TV-Patent-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
