DFA has opened a new office in Harare, Zimbabwe marking its first expansion into African markets outside of South Africa. DFA Zimbabwe will be led by Simon Chimutsotso, an executive with experience in rolling out telecommunications infrastructure in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and South Africa. “We have rolled out network infrastructure in all of the major South African metropolitan areas and have extended our footprint to large and small towns, amounting to over 13,000km of ducting space,” said DFA executive for strategy, Vino Govender. “Our entry into Zimbabwe is in line with our strategic intent of expanding into sub-Saharan and other African markets,” Govender added. Chimutsotso said that DFA Zimbabwe will build on the company’s experience in South Africa to give Zimbabwean telecommunications operators and ISPs access to the same level of connectivity as DFA South Africa does. “We now stand primed to deliver a reliable and cost-efficient open-access network and high-quality service,” said Chimutsotso.
