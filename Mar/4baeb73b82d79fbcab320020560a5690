Ride-hailing business Bolt – formerly Taxify – has announced plans to launch a food delivery service in South Africa. “Combined with our technology, efficient operations, and thousands of drivers in South Africa, we plan to build the best food delivery service for the people who already use our services daily,” said Bolt CEO Markus Villig. The South African launch of this service will likely see the country become one of the first three worldwide to have access to the service, alongside Estonia and Finland. Bolt recently underwent a global rebrand, including changing its name from Taxify, in a move aimed at bringing its brand identity in line with the company’s “broader vision of transportation”. “We are bullish that the future is fully electric and so we wanted a name that moved us away from the combustion engine,” said Villig. Bolt’s services currently include ride-hailing with cars and motorbikes, as well as scooter sharing.
