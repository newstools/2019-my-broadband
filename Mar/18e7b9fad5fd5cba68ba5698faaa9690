Microsoft will release a paid Extended Security Updates (ESU) product that will fix security flaws and vulnerabilities in Windows 7 after general support ends in January 2020. The product will be sold from 1 April 2019, and will fix flaws that are rated as being in the top two of Microsoft’s four-level threat ranking system. ESU will be offered yearly for up to three years, and will cost $25-$50 per device for the first year, rising to $100 to $200 for the final year. The ESU product will also offer users the ability to use Office 365 ProPlus, which includes Outlook, Word, Excel, and other Microsoft Office applications, despite general support for ProPlus ending alongside Windows 7. Microsoft continues to recommend that users move to Windows 10, labeling it “the most productive, secure, and cost-effective experience for users and IT departments”. Over 800 million devices currently run Windows 10, up 100 million from September 2018.
