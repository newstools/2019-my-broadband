Huawei has revealed its new range of P30 flagship smartphones at a launch event in Paris. The company revealed the P30 and P30 Pro smartphones at the event, which both include a selection of powerful features. Huawei’s P30 and P30 Pro offer great new camera functionality in addition to an overhauled design which minimises the presence of the front camera notch while expanding the edges of the OLED display. Major changes include the addition of in-screen optical fingerprint sensors on both the P30 and P30 Pro, with the P30 Pro also getting support for wireless charging. Huawei’s P30 Pro also supports 40W fast wireless charging in addition to wireless quick charge and reverse wireless charging functionality. The displays on the P30 and P30 Pro are almost completely bezel-less, with Huawei minimising the top and bottom bezels and removing the front speaker in favour of a sound-on display solution which vibrates the smartphone’s screen to produce audio. Both smartphones are dual-SIM devices and support a NanoSD memory card in their second SIM slots for expandable storage. Huawei has made a major leap forward in mobile photography with its new flagship smartphones, offering more features and better quality than previous generations. The standout feature is a 50x digital super zoom, which uses an array of cameras to take zoomed photos from distance. Huawei has also implemented a fourth time-of-flight (TOF) lens on its P30 Pro, which provides improved bokeh effects and object tracking. Both the rear and front camera systems on the Huawei P30 and P30 Pro will support HDR photos, and the new Sony SuperSpectrum sensor installed in both devices allows for unprecedented low-light photo quality. The company expects the Leica camera on its P30 and P30 Pro smartphones to reach the top of the DxOMark scoreboard for image quality, thanks to its unprecedented night photography features. Huawei said it has also entered into an exclusive two-year deal with Sony for its SuperSpectrum sensor, which means it may take a while for the opposition to catch up in terms of image quality. The company further announced new videography features for its Android devices, include dual-view recording. This allows you to capture both an ultra-wide clip side-by-side with a zoom shot. The new smartphones will be available in Amber Sunrise, Breathing Crystal, and Aurora colour finishes. The specifications of the new devices are listed below.
