Vodacom is the most efficient large ICT company in South Africa, based on a “Net Income per employee” (NIPE) ranking, followed by MultiChoice and Alviva. Net Income per employee – which is calculated by dividing the company’s net income by the number of employees – gives an indication of the efficiency of a company. A high net income per employee typically shows that a company has a productive workforce and efficient operations. Apart from skilled and productive employees, higher efficiency and a higher NIPE can also be achieved through the innovative use of technology and automation. According to the latest annual reports from JSE-listed ICT companies, Vodacom has the highest net income per employee: just over R2 million. At the other end of the scale, state-owned enterprises Eskom and the SABC have accrued large losses – which point to a highly inefficient and unskilled workforce. The graphic below provides an overview of the NIPE for prominent ICT companies based on their latest annual reports. It should be noted, however, that not all companies reported net income – and in these cases the closest reported number was selected. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-300600" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Profit-per-employee.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="516" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Profit-per-employee.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Profit-per-employee-496x400.jpg 496w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Profit-per-employee-768x619.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Profit-per-employee-533x430.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
