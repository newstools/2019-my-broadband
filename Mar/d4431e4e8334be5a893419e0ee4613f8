Cell C completed the implementation of its new roaming agreement with MTN in November 2018, and new network benchmarking results confirm the value it offers Cell C subscribers. Cell C previously roamed on Vodacom’s 3G network – without any 4G access – in areas where it did not have coverage. Its new roaming agreement provides Cell C subscribers with 3G and 4G access on MTN’s network in areas where Cell C has chosen to purchase coverage rather than self-build. The results of this agreement show in the latest P3 Communications research report which was released in February. P3 Communications performed 5,200 voice tests and 4,600 data tests in South African cities (50%), towns (10%), and on roads (40%) between 24 January and 11 February 2019. The report reveals that Cell C’s network performance improved by 46% when compared to the same period last year. The table below provides an overview of Cell C’s network performance based on P3 Communications’ results. It should be noted that these scores were normalised to make a like-for-like comparison possible, as the scoring methodology changed in 2019.
