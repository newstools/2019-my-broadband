Former president Kgalema Motlanthe has stated that the ANC is “in worse shape” than it was before current President Cyril Ramaphosa was elected. Speaking to the Sunday Times, Motlanthe added that the current list of potential MPs in the ANC was “weak and did not inspire confidence”. Motlanthe was interim president of South African in 2008 when Thabo Mbeki was replaced by Jacob Zuma – and he served under Zuma for several years. He said he does not think that Ramaphosa can save the ANC and that the party is “not in great shape”. “I think to strengthen the ANC it needs a surgical overhaul from where it is now. It is worse than it was in 2017,” he stated. Motlanthe said to improve the party, it needed to be opened to people from “all walks of life”. Motlanthe’s statement follows years of corruption and state capture in government departments, reportedly orchestrated by ANC members. This has led to, among other things, load-shedding in South Africa due to the impact of corruption in Eskom. Energy expert Ted Blom recently stated that one of the reasons Eskom is still in major trouble is because it is being run by a “bunch of amateurs”. Blom said the current Eskom board has been in place for over a year, but the situation at the power utility is now worse than under the previous corrupt board. “This board is ineffective, they do not have the necessary experience and the chairman is conflicted,” said Blom. Blom said the ANC government employed people who do not know what is going on because it refuses to look outside of the party for people with the required skills.
