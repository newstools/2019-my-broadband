By Cheryl Otstott Most of the Xerox multifunction printers can scan and it is a relatively easy process. Easy until you, on that rare occasion, encounter a Login Failure Message. You may see that message if you are scanning using either SMB or FTP.  There is a list of things to check for if this message displays. If you still get the Login Failure Message after checking and adjusting all the items listed above please go to the support page for your machine and search “Login Failure” to see if there any additional suggestions. Post questions on the Xerox Customer Support Community Forum or call your local support centre for further assistance. For more information, visit the Bytes Document Solutions website.
