Valve announced that it has launched an early beta version of Steam Link Anywhere, which allows users to stream their games to any compatible device. This service is an extension of Steam Link, which allows users to stream games from their desktop PC to a compatible device over an Internet connection. The platform is compatible with the Steam Link and any device running the Steam Link application. This includes Android TV boxes, Raspberry Pi, selected smart TVs, and Android smartphones. According to Steam, users can stream their games over the Internet as long as the Steam client on their desktop PC is updated, their computer has good upload speeds, and the device they are streaming to has a good network connection. Valve did not state the exact specifications required to stream at various resolutions, but added that it would continue to improve the Steam Link Anywhere experience.
