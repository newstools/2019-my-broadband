Google is increasing the scope of its Project Treble programme for the upcoming version of Android. Project Treble aims to improve the delivery of Android updates to devices from manufacturers who use third-party software on top of the stock Android operating system. Last year, the Android 9.0 beta was rolled out to a number of devices in addition to Googleâ€™s Pixel smartphones, including handsets from OnePlus, Nokia, Xiaomi, and Sony. Speaking to the hosts of the Android Developers Backstage podcast, the Project Treble team said the number of companies participating in the Android 10 beta will be bigger than the previous year. This means that more Android smartphone manufacturers could include support for beta access. The developers did not state which companies will be participating in the Android 10 beta, apart from the manufacturers who participated in the programme last year. If major manufacturers such as Samsung, LG, and Huawei were to participate in the programme, this could greatly improve the adoption of the latest version of Android, as OS updates generally take quite long to reach these smartphones.
