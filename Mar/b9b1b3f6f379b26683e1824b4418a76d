Pargo has expanded its network of parcel pick-up points to Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. The service will enable South African users to send parcels across borders. Pargo’s new service utilises existing partnerships with Clicks and Lewis, as well as new partnerships with local retailers. Initially, access to these countries will only be available to large corporates who are looking to increase their market share across borders. Pargo said it decided to expand its offering to these countries following requests from their client base, who had seen an increasing demand for their products in the countries. “As a smart logistics company, Pargo strives to make delivery accessible, affordable, and convenient,” said Pargo. “This alternative to traditional courier services is now enabling cross-border delivery at an affordable rate and helping to grow ecommerce on the continent.”
