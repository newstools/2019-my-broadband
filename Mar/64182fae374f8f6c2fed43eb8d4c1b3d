Apple has launched new iMac PCs, with 21.5-inch and 27-inch models available. The company said the new iMac can be fitted with an 8-core Intel 9th-generation CPU and Radeon Vega graphics – giving it a “2x performance boost”. The display on the 27-inch model is also a Retina 5K screen with a 5,120 x 2,880 resolution, giving users exceptional visual quality. Pricing for the 27-inch iMac starts at $1,799, and for this users receive an Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, 1TB Fusion Drive, Radeon Pro 570X, and the 5K display. For those who need more power under the hood, however, Apple offers a range of hardware upgrades. The 27-inch iMac can be fitted with a Radeon Pro Vega 48 8GB graphics card, up to 64GB DDR4 2,666MHz RAM, and a 2TB SSD. This, naturally, comes at an increased price. Unfortunately, at the time of writing there was no South African pricing for the new models – but the US Apple store listed pricing for the new iMac and its upgrades. To see what hardware you can pack into the new Apple PC, and how much it costs, we specced the 27-inch model to the max. The results are detailed in the table below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299946" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iMac-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iMac-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iMac-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iMac-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
