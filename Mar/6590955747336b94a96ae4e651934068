As GPUs continue to improve, their pricing goes up. This is where the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 comes in, with Nvidia stating it offers a fantastic balance between price and performance. As an upgrade to the GTX 1060, the GTX 1660 offers an increase in performance over its predecessor while still costing under R5,000. The GeForce GTX 1660 is also the most affordable of the Turing-based GPUs available, making it a great option for gamers who want the latest technology. It doesn’t offer features found in the RTX cards however, such as ray-tracing. This price and performance balance has led TechRadar to describe the Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 OC 6G as the “absolutely the best entry-level graphics card”. According to performance tests, the GTX 1660 offers solid 1080p gaming performance while holding its own against the AMD RX 590 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070. This ensures that it has taken over from GPUs such as the GTX 1060 and GTX 1050 Ti in the entry-level GPU market.
