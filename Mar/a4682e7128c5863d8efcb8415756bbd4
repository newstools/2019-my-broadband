The smartphone market is dominated by three companies: Huawei, Apple, and Samsung. These brands have become the go-to for customers looking for a high-quality smartphone which will last them until their next contract upgrade. A few years ago, however, Huawei was not mentioned in the same breath as Apple and Samsung. The Chinese company has powered its way into the limelight by offering high-quality smartphones at affordable prices – and its big play in the global market has shown that new brands can break into the top tier. Equally, the decline of brands such as Nokia and Motorola shows that movement can be made in the other direction, too. There are numerous smaller smartphone brands today which aim to reach the heights of today’s market leaders. Ranging from long-time, reputable companies to some which are relatively unknown, these brands each have plans to break through to the next level. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-240878" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Xiaomi-logo.jpg" alt="Xiaomi logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Xiaomi-logo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Xiaomi-logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Xiaomi-logo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Xiaomi are quite similar to Huawei in that they are a Chinese smartphone company best known for offering powerful smartphones at notably cheaper prices. Its recently-announced flagship Mi 9, for example, offers users an AI-powered triple-camera set-up, as well as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and wireless charging. Despite offering these fantastic specifications, this smartphone costs €449 – much cheaper than competing devices. The company has also already released a 5G smartphone in the Mi MIX 3 5G. If Xiaomi continues to undercut the market by offering fantastic value-for-money smartphones, it could make similar progress to Huawei. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298534" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LG_Logo.png" alt="LG_Logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LG_Logo.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LG_Logo-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LG_Logo-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> LG has been in the smartphone market for a long time, but has never quite cracked the top tier of smartphone brands. However, it has made good strides recently, having released its LG V50 ThinQ 5G foldable smartphone which uses the a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor while offering 6GB RAM and 128GB storage space. Additionally, LG’s flagship G8 ThinQ offers a triple-camera system, as well as 3D Hand ID and Wi-Fi 6 support. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-298532" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oppo_Logo-639x430.png" alt="Oppo_Logo" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oppo_Logo-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oppo_Logo-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oppo_Logo-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oppo_Logo.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Oppo is another Chinese smartphone brand that could look to follow in Huawei’s footsteps and become more popular globally. Founded in 2004, the smartphone maker offers fantastic potential for global growth after Huawei paved the way for Chinese smartphones in international markets. Oppo’s upcoming flagship smartphone, rumoured to be called the Oppo Find Z, is expected to offer users a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, a 4,065mAh battery, and a camera that offers 10x optical zoom. This places it in line with other flagship devices. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298538" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Vivo_Logo.png" alt="Vivo_Logo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Vivo_Logo.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Vivo_Logo-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Vivo_Logo-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Vivo is yet another Chinese brand looking to grow its global market share. It received global attention for releasing the first in-display fingerprint sensor in a phone, positioning it as a smartphone company capable of innovation. It has also recently showcased its portless 5G Apex concept smartphone – another clear sign of its innovation potential. Its powerful Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and sports a massive 10GB of RAM. The Vivo Nex also offers dual-SIM functionality and a display on either side of the smartphone.
