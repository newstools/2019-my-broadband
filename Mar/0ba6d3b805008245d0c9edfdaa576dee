Intel has released a product change notification document announcing the retirement of all Intel 6th-generation Skylake desktop processors. The chip manufacturer had already discontinued a number of desktop CPUs two years ago, but it has now categorised the entire generation as end-of-life. OEMs have up until 27 September to place their last orders for the processors, with the final shipment date being 6 March 2020. The announcement resulted in the official retirement of 22 Skylake processors, ranging from Celeron and Pentium chips up to Core i7 CPUs. Intel has already rolled out its 9th-generation processors which feature a higher number of cores and greatly-improved processing capabilities compared to previous generations, although many still use the same LGA 1151 socket used by the companyâ€™s 6th-generation CPUs.
