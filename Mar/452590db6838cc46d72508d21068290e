Sasfin and Hello Paisa have announced a collaboration on a digital banking initiative for the South African market. The companies said that the product will revolutionise the South African banking experience. Hello Paisa’s digital banking offering is backed by Sasfin’s banking platforms and infrastructure, and it comprises services such as a mobile app, mobile SIM card, bank account, and a Visa debit card that operates at any ATM or point-of-sale device. The account can be opened in minutes, and Hello Paisa said that it plans to bundle its offering to suit the needs of South Africans. “We saw this initiative with Hello Paisa as an ideal way to offer banking to people we believe are underserved. More importantly, we have the opportunity to do so with a partner that genuinely understands the needs of its customers and has built products to serve their needs,” said Sasfin CEO Michael Sassoon. This partnership follows Sasfin’s announcement last year that it aims to deliver new products and services through either partnering, acquiring or developing technology that offers valuable services to customers. Sasfin said that its collaboration with Hello Paisa is a significant step in its journey to serve new markets. Ahmed Cassim, the managing director of Hello Paisa, said that creating personalised products to serve the unbanked is a fundamental mandate of this initiative. “We serve hundreds of thousands of customers who are underserved, whom traditional banking players cannot reach. Providing them with access to the banking world will make a huge difference to them in growing their businesses and creating more jobs.”
