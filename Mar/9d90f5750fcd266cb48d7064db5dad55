Jigsaw, a side-project at Alphabet, has announced that it will release Tune: a Chrome extension that blocks toxic comments on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This new extension will give people “the ability to control for themselves what kind of comments they want to see”, said Jigsaw. Tune is based on the same technology that powers Jigsaw’s Perspective software, which is an API that rates the impact comments have on conversations, including how toxic they are. According to Jigsaw, Tune will allow users to choose the level of toxicity they are willing to see, including a “zen mode” where comments are completely blocked. Jigsaw acknowledges that Tune’s machine learning algorithms are still experimental, meaning that it will not hide all toxic comments and may sometimes block non-toxic comments. “Rather, it’s an experiment to show people how machine learning technology can create new ways to empower people as they read discussions online,” said Jigsaw.
