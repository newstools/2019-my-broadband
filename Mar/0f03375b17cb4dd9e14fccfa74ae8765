Petrol price increases, tax hikes, and a weakening rand – the list of items diminishing your disposable income at the start of 2019 is growing rapidly. What this means for those seeking new hardware and gadgets is that budgets are more important than ever, and saving a few bucks becomes crucial. One way to save money on tech items is to import them, with a quick and easy option Amazon in the US. Amazon ships certain items directly to South Africa, and includes shipping and import duties as part of the total a user pays at checkout. The only caveat that comes with importing tech from the US is that it may have a plug which does not fit local sockets – and it does not come with local support. When buying a product directly from the US you are essentially buying a grey import. This means no local support or warranties: value-adds you receive if you buy the item from a local retailer. If this is not a concern for you, however, then comparing prices and potentially shipping in an item from the US is something you should consider. To provide an example of how prices compare, we selected a list of common tech items along with their pricing from online retailers in South African and Amazon in the US. The exchange rate at time of writing was $1 = R14.28, and Amazon’s default shipping options were used.
