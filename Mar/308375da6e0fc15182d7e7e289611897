SAA Voyager members must sign into their Voyager account via the SAA website to convert their miles into an Uber voucher. These Uber vouchers are valid for three years from the date of issue, and are available in the following denominations: “Uber and SAA both serve millions of customers in a variety of cities around the world, which makes this partnership a perfect fit,” said Uber Sub-Saharan Africa strategic partnerships executive Shavaye Govender. “Partnering with a progressive brand like Uber means that our customers get to enjoy travel across two mediums namely, air and road,” said SAA executive for customer loyalty Suretha Cruse.
