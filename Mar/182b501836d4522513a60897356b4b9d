Eskom has started stage 2 load-shedding, following the implementation of stage 1 load-shedding earlier today. Eskom stated on Twitter that stage 2 load-shedding will take place from 15:00 to 23:00. “We are currently load-shedding in stage 2 due to high demand or urgent maintenance being performed at certain power stations. To determine the time/s that you will be affected, please view the schedule for your area,’ said Eskom. The news follows energy regulator Nersa recently granting Eskom’s request for tariff hikes. The regulator said that it had granted Eskom tariff increases for the next three years.
