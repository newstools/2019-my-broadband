Samsung has launched its new LPDDR4X mobile DRAM, which is the highest-capacity mobile DRAM in the world. The 12GB mobile DRAM module will allow smartphone manufacturers to maximise the potential of devices which boast multiple cameras, large displays, and high-end network functionality. The company said it has started mass producing the LPDDR4X memory, which it added boasts higher capacity than most ultra-thin notebooks. “Samsung is now providing a comprehensive line-up of advanced memory to power the new era of smartphones, from 12GB mobile DRAM to 512GB eUFS 3.0 storage,” said Samsung Electronics Memory Marketing executive VP Sewon Chun. This capacity was achieved by combining six 16-gigabit LPDDR4X chips based on the second-generation 10nm-class manufacturing process into a single package, which provides more space for the smartphone’s battery. The memory also delivers data transfer rates of 34.1GB/s, while minimising an increase in power consumption.
