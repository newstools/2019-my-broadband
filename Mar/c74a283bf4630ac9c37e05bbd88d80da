Apple has launched a credit card, which the company has named the Apple Card. The credit card was created by Apple to “help customers lead a healthier financial life”, said the company. “Apple Card is built into the Apple Wallet app on iPhone, offering customers a familiar experience with Apple Pay and the ability to manage their card right on iPhone,” it said. Apple Card features no fees – including annual, late, international, or over-the-limit fees. The company said it will also provide interest rates that are among the lowest in the industry. Additionally, customers will receive a percentage of every Apple Card purchase amount back as a daily cash reward. In addition to no fees, Apple said the card will offer smart functionality. “Apple Card uses machine learning and Apple Maps to clearly label transactions with merchant names and locations. Purchases are automatically totalled and organised by colour-coded categories such as Food and Drinks,” said Apple. Weekly and monthly spending reports are also provided with Apple Card. Apple said it has partnered with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard to provide the support required to issue the card, and for it to be accepted by global payment networks. It also features unique security measures, which include a unique card number which is stored on the user’s iPhone. “Every purchase is secure because it is authorised with Face ID or Touch ID, and a one-time unique dynamic security code,” said Apple. “The unique security and privacy architecture created for Apple Card means Apple doesn’t know where a customer shopped, what they bought, or how much they paid,” it added. Apple went on to state that it was launching a physical titanium Apple Card for instances when Apple Pay is not accepted. “With no card number, CVV security code, expiration date, or signature on the card, Apple Card is more secure than any other physical credit card,” said Apple. “All this information is easily accessible in Wallet to use in apps and on websites.” Apple Card will be available to US customers later this year. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-300488" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-card.png" alt="" width="640" height="438" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-card.png 1764w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-card-585x400.png 585w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-card-768x525.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-card-629x430.png 629w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-card-1200x820.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-300480 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Card_hand-iPhoneXS-payment_032519-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Card_hand-iPhoneXS-payment_032519-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Card_hand-iPhoneXS-payment_032519-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Card_hand-iPhoneXS-payment_032519-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Card_hand-iPhoneXS-payment_032519-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
