MySpace confirmed that it has lost around 12 years worth of user content, including all music uploaded between 2003 and 2015. In response to concerned users on Reddit, MySpace said: “As a result of a server migration project, any photos, videos, and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available on or from MySpace.” “We apologise for the inconvenience and suggest that you retain your back up copies,” the company added. Over 50 million songs from more than 14 million artists are believed to have been lost as a result of the failed migration. In February 2018, a Reddit user claimed to have received an email from MySpace’s support team highlighting that an issue existed regarding the same data. At the time, however, MySpace reportedly believed that the issue would be fixed. MySpace was the largest social media platform in the world for a period spanning from 2005 to 2009, but faded away after Facebook’s rise to prominence.
