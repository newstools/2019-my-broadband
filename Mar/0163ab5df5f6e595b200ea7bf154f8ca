FibreTiger has relaunched its fibre and Internet comparison website, making it easy to find the best deal. The site was launched in November 2016 as a destination for local broadband users to compare Internet service providers (ISPs). The site lists most prominent fibre ISPs, including Afrihost, Axxess, Cool Ideas, MWEB, Telkom, and Vox. FibreTiger founder Jacques du Rand told MyBroadband that the new site includes a fresh design and improved functionality. They have also added an ADSL comparison, which means visitors can compare fibre, LTE, and ADSL prices from 15 ISPs. Du Rand said most South Africans still struggle to understand the technicalities of fibre and broadband access, which is why their service has been well received.
