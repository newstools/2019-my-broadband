LEGO has weighed in on the hype surrounding the announcement of foldable smartphones, poking fun at Samsung’s new Galaxy Fold with its own “foldable”. The company tweeted a picture of a “LEGO Fold” product in the style of Samsung’s Galaxy Fold marketing material, although it promises that its product will never run out of battery. LEGO’s product is touted as having a “stunning 5-inch cover display” which unfolds into an 11-inch pop-up story book. While the tweet was presented as a jibe at Samsung and Huawei’s foldable devices, the “LEGO Fold” is actually a real product available for purchase from the LEGO store. The LEGO Pop-Up Book includes mini-figures and bricks themed around Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk. LEGO’s foldable may not run Android Pie and it may be six cameras short of competing with Samsung’s device, but it is priced at $70 – which is far easier on your wallet.
