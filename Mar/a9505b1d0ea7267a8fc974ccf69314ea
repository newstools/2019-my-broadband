FNB has launched support for the Samsung Pay app, allowing clients with compatible devices to make contactless payments at terminals across the country. Users with a compatible Samsung Galaxy smartphone can now scan their FNB Cheque or Credit Card to add it to their application and begin making payments. The bank added that FNB Business Credit Cards are not supported by Samsung Pay. Samsung Pay is compatible with the following Samsung devices: “Samsung Pay is the latest partner wallet to be enabled by FNB, following last year’s successful launch of both Garmin Pay and Fitbit Pay,” said FNB head of digital payments Jason Viljoen. “In addition, FNB remains the only bank in Africa to allow customers to make contactless payments via any compatible Android smartphone, using FNB Pay on the FNB App.” “The bank’s support for Samsung Pay, coupled with the recent launch of the new Scan to Pay feature on the FNB App, provides customers with even more choice when it comes to digital payments,” he said. Samsung Pay uses both NFC and MST technology to make payments, making it compatible with the majority of payment terminals in South Africa. The app is available for download from the Google Play Store.
