Eskom has announced it will continue with load-shedding on Tuesday 19 March, following the implementation of stage 4 load-shedding on Monday. The power utility said that stage 2 load-shedding would be implemented until 09:00, after which the schedule will shift to stage 4. “Stage 2 load-shedding will continue today, 19 March until 09:00 this morning whereafter we will move to stage 4 load-shedding,” Eskom announced on Twitter. “This is due to a shortage of capacity. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience.” Eskom has been implementing stage 4 load-shedding every day since Saturday, following a loss of capacity which included imports from Mozambique. The power utility previously stated that the recent tropical cyclone which ravaged Mozambique damaged power transmission lines to South Africa, resulting in the loss of 1,100MW from the country.
