Afrihost has announced big price cuts on select uncapped ADSL bundles. The price cuts range from 18% to 55% across business and premium packages, and include DSL line rental fees. Users who sign up for or upgrade to a 20Mbps Business bundle, for example, will save over R1,200 per month, said Afrihost. “The new Uncapped Bundle pricing is available now on Afrihost’s website for new clients signing up for the first time. Existing clients already on eligible bundles have already been automatically migrated onto the new bundle pricing as of 1 March 2019,” said the ISP. “Existing clients who are on other bundles can migrate their current packages onto the new bundle pricing now in ClientZone.” Afrihost stated that the pricing does not include the voice line rental payable to Telkom.
