Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. maker of computer memory chips, said it’s cutting production in response to a slump in demand for its key products, taking quick action to ease the impact on revenue. Shares rose in extended trading. The company also said it will reduce its investment in improving manufacturing by about $500 million. Revenue in the current period will be about $4.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million, the Boise, Idaho-based company said Wednesday on a conference call. That compares with an average analyst prediction of $5.34 billion. The middle of that range would represent a sales decline of 38 percent. Micron projected profit of 85 cents a share, plus or minus 10 cents, in the period ending in May. Micron’s stock gained about 4.5 percent in extended trading following the announcement. It closed earlier at $40.13 in New York. Shares have rallied more than 26 percent along with other chip stocks as investors bought into industry executive’s reassurances that demand will improve in the second half of the year.
