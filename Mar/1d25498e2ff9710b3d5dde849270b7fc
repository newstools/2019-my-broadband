Huawei recently launched its new Y7 2019 smartphone in South Africa, delivering an attractive device into the mid-range market. The device features a modern bezel-less display similar to many flagship devices, along with a great camera system and capable hardware. According to Huawei, the Y7 2019 is targeted at younger consumers and combines high-quality technology and stylish design to offer great value. At its price point of R3,999, the Y7 2019 is also attractive from a value perspective – especially considering the lack of features in other devices within the same price bracket. We tried out the Huawei Y7 2019 and were very impressed with what it offers for its price tag. One of the best features of the Y7 2019 is its 6.26-inch DewDrop display, which boasts the smallest notch on any Huawei device to date. The notch houses an 8MP front camera which supports a number of intelligent photo capture methods. Other standout features include a 4,000mAh battery along with a 13MP + 2MP dual-camera system on the top corner of the rear of the device. Below are the specifications of the Huawei Y7 2019. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-299386" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4.jpg" alt="Huawei Y7 2019 (4)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-4-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> When it comes to the amount of smartphone you get for your money, the Huawei Y7 2019 is difficult to beat. Complete with Android 8.1, a slim bezel and chassis, and a dual-camera system, the Y7 2019 looks and functions more like a flagship smartphone than a competitor in the cheaper ranks of the market. The device boasts some impressive software features too, most notably the AI-powered object and scene recognition on the rear camera and the shutter controls on the front-facing lens. Huawei’s AI-powered camera provides real-time scene and object recognition which can recognise 22 different categories of objects – including people, dogs, and landscapes. Users can also take selfies by gesture control or smile detection instead of physically interacting with the smartphone. The Huawei Y7 2019 boasts a number of unique and fun features, making it a good deal for consumers who want powerful features in a mid-range device. The smartphone is available from all operators in South African in two colours – Aurora Blue and Midnight Black. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-299380" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1.jpg" alt="Huawei Y7 2019 (1)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-1-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-299382" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2.jpg" alt="Huawei Y7 2019 (2)" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-Y7-2019-2-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
