Samsung has rolled out an update to flagship devices which allows users to remap the Bixby button, Softpedia News reports. This feature has rolled out to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+, Galaxy S9 and S9+, Note 8, and Note 9. The Galaxy S10 range already includes this feature at launch. Users must download the latest versions of the Bixby and Bixby Home services to customise the functionality of the hardware button. Remapping the Bixby button can be done by navigating to Settings > Advanced Features > Bixby Key and choosing from the following options: While you will be able to configure the button to open another application, the key must still be used as a Bixby launcher. For example, choosing to open a different app on a single press means that a double press of the button will open Bixby.
