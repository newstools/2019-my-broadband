Samsung’s Galaxy S10 in South Africa is powered by an Exynos 9820 chipset made by Samsung, which features eight CPU cores and Mali-G76 graphics. In the US, however, the same phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset. The difference in performance between these processors may not be noticable to an average user, but they do exist – and Android Authority has conducted benchmarks to measure the gap. The tests found the following: These performance differences extend to the graphics power of the devices. “Gamers will definitely want to opt for a Snapdragon 855 handset where available. Not only did the Adreno 640’s performance win out in most benchmarks, Qualcomm’s SoC also has the legs to offer peak performance for longer than competing chips,” said Android Authority.
