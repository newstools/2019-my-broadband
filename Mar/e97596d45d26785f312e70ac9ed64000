ICASA has published an amendment to the End-User and Service Subscriber Charter, extending the deadline for the implementation of certain regulations. The extension of the deadline aims to ensure that the enforcement of the deadline does not result in unintended consequences for mobile operators and consumers. ICASA said it received requests to suspend the implementation date for regulations relating to opt-out of notification for depletion of voice, SMS, and data services and out-of-bundle usage requirements. “After careful consideration, ICASA decided to extend the date for the implementation of the above regulations to 12 April 2019,” ICASA stated. The authority added that it expects mobile networks to use the extended time to fully configure their systems to comply with the regulations by the new deadline. ICASA said that the regulations regarding out-of-bundle blocking by default are implemented with effect on 1 March 2018.
