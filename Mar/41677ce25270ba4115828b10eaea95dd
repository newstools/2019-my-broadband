Italian car design company Pininfarina has launched the most powerful Italian supercar ever made – the Battista. The electric vehicle puts up impressive performance figures, including: Pininfarina said the Battista, which was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show, will do 450km on a single charge and will sell for $2.27 million. While an all-electric car which costs over $2 million may not excite supercar fans, there is no denying the vehicle’s performance. It is touted as the most powerful Italian supercar ever made and easily surpasses top models from the likes of Ferrari and Lamborghini. The car was put together by designers and engineers from the Formula 1 scene, Porsche, and Lamborghini, according to reports, and only 150 Battistas will be made. Deliveries of the car will only begin at the end of 2020, however. Its body is made from carbon fibre and its interior is fitted with touchscreen and LEDs – as one would expect from a modern electric vehicle in this price bracket. In terms of its battery and drivetrain, its 120kWh lithium ion battery pack reportedly goes from 0-80% charge in 40 minutes on a high-voltage connection. It also packs a four-wheel drive system with torque vectoring, carbon ceramic brakes, and 21-inch wheels with Pirelli tyres. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298272 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-1-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-1-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298274 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-2-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-2-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298278 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-4-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-4-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-4.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298280 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-5-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-5-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-5-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-5.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298282 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298276 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-3-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-3-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-3.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298270 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Battista-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
