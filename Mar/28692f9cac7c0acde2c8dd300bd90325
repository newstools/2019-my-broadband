Apple has unveiled TV+, its new streaming service which will take on Netflix. Apple TV+ will feature exclusive original shows, movies, and documentaries – and will launch later in 2019. “Apple TV+ will feature a brand new slate of programming from the world’s most celebrated creative artists, including Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Octavia Spencer, J.J. Abrams, Jason Momoa, and M. Night Shyamalan,” said Apple. “Apple TV+ will be home to some of the highest quality original storytelling that TV and movie lovers have seen yet.” The service will be available via the Apple TV app, which has been upgraded and now includes Apple TV channels – launching in May 2019. “The all-new Apple TV app brings together the different ways to discover and watch shows, movies, sports, news, and more in one app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, smart TVs, and streaming devices,” said Apple. It will let users subscribe to streaming services from HBO, Showtime, CBS, and Starz. Users will also be able to purchase or rent iTunes movies and TV shows in the app. Pricing and availability of the Apple TV+ subscription service will be announced later this year, said Apple. “The all-new Apple TV app is coming to iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV customers in over 100 countries with a free software update this May, and to Mac this fall,” it added. The Apple TV app will also be available on Samsung smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV, LG, Roku, Sony, and Vizio platforms in the future. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-300492 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-TV-640x392.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="392" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-TV-640x392.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-TV-600x367.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-TV-768x470.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-TV.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
