Eskom has announced that it is implementing stage 4 load-shedding. “Due to the loss of an additional 900MW from Mozambique imports, load-shedding will move up to stage 4 from 12:00,” said Eskom. This follows stage 3 load-shedding being implemented from 10:00 today. On Friday, it was already announced that stage 2 load-shedding would be implemented today and that the power supply was constrained. Eskom added that it needs to conserve water and diesel supplies for load-shedding countermeasures in the coming week.
