Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced on Twitter that the company will launch its Model Y SUV on 14 March. The Model Y will likely be a more affordable version of the Model X, in a similar way to how the Model 3 is a “budget” version of the Model S. According to Musk, the vehicle will be around 10% larger than Tesla’s Model 3 and its price will follow suit. Tesla will launch the Model Y at its LA Design Studio, where it will offer detailed specifications, pricing, and test drives to journalists. Musk previously predicted that the Model Y would begin production in 2020, and the upcoming launch suggests that this timeline is still likely. Musk also announced that Tesla will be switching on its first V3.0 Supercharger Station on 6 March.
