Google is re-implementing the F6 shortcut that it removed in Chrome 72, reports Softpedia News. Previously, users had been able to press F6 to automatically switch focus to the URL bar of the browser â€“ letting users type a new URL. However, from Chrome 72, pressing F6 first places the focus onto the tab bar, meaning users must press F6 a second time before they can type a new URL. While this may appear to be a minor issue, many users enjoyed the shortcut and were disappointed when it was removed. The change has been implemented in the latest version of Chrome Canary, but it remains unknown as to when Google will implement it in Chrome. Google Chrome version 73 is expected to launch on 12 March.
