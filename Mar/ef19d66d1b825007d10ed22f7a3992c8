Google has filed a patent detailing the notification functionality of its “Netflix for games” streaming service, along with a design for the platform’s controller. The patent details the functionality of the controller it has designed for the game streaming platform, including basic sketches of the gamepad’s layout. Google’s controller will feature a dedicated microphone button in addition to a Google home button, indicating potential interaction with the company’s voice assistant. The company launched a Project Stream trial platform in partnership with Ubisoft last year which allowed participants to play Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey in their Chrome browser. Google is expected to reveal more information around its game streaming service later this month. Below are the patent images for Google’s video game controller design, along with renders by Yankodesign. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298810" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Controller-patent.jpg" alt="Google Controller patent" width="640" height="1024" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Controller-patent.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Controller-patent-250x400.jpg 250w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Controller-patent-269x430.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298812" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-1.jpg" alt="Google Stream render 1" width="640" height="472" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-1.jpg 1050w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-1-542x400.jpg 542w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-1-768x567.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-1-583x430.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298814" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-2.jpg" alt="Google Stream render 2" width="640" height="472" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-2.jpg 1050w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-2-542x400.jpg 542w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-2-768x567.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-2-583x430.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-298816" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-3-640x427.jpg" alt="Google Stream render 3" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-3-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Google-Stream-render-3.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
