Apple has acknowledged that there are issues with “certain” MacBook keyboards and it is “sorry” for this. Following a report in The Wall Street Journal on the faulty keyboards, Apple issued a statement where it said it was aware that “a small number of users are having issues with their third-generation butterfly keyboard”. “The vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the new keyboard,” said Apple. The keyboard problem is reported to be caused by dust or other particles building up beneath a MacBook’s keys, with the switches failing in certain cases as a result. This led to a class-action lawsuit by consumers against Apple, and Apple offering free repairs to users. Apple also changed the design of its MacBook keyboards in 2018 to rectify the issue, placing a silicon membrane under each key. This has done little to assuage the anger of affected users, however, some of whom have called the MacBook keyboard the worst product in Apple’s history.
