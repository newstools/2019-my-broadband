Intel and the USB Promoter Group have announced the USB 4 standard, which is set to release soon. It is based on the Thunderbolt protocol and will increase compatibility among USB Type-C connector-based products, said Intel. The standard is set to support 40Gbps speeds and the Thunderbolt 3.0 standard – following Intel opening the licencing of the technology to manufacturers. “Today, Intel announced that it contributed the Intel Thunderbolt protocol specification to the USB Promoter Group, enabling other chip makers to build Thunderbolt compatible silicon, royalty-free,” said Intel. Thunderbolt 3 technology supports data, media, and power connections.
