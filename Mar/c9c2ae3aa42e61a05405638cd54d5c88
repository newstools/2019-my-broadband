Microsoft has added a function to Windows 10 which automatically uninstalls updates that cause conflicts with the operating system. According to a support document on the company’s website, Windows 10 will try to resolve issues with failed updates by uninstalling recent patches. “Windows automatically installs updates to keep your device secure and running at peak efficiency,” the support page states. “Occasionally, these updates can fail due to incompatibility or issues in new software.” If a user experiences a startup failure due to incompatibility, they may receive a message upon recovery stating: “We removed some recently installed updates to recover your device from a startup failure.” Microsoft said this action is only taken when all other automatic recovery attempts are unsuccessful. When this rollback occurs, Microsoft will also flag problematic Windows 10 updates and prevent them from installing automatically for the next 30 days.
