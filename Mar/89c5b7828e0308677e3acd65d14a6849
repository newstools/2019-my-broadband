Users who replace the faulty batteries in their iPhones with aftermarket parts may no longer void their warranty, MacRumors reports. Previously, Genius Bars and Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs) did not service any devices with third-party batteries – regardless of the circumstances. However, these outlets are now being instructed to ignore the presence of a third-party battery when conducting repairs, provided the repair is unrelated to the battery. Additionally, if the repair is related to the battery, technicians are now allowed to replace the aftermarket component with an official Apple battery for a standard battery replacement fee. Technicians can also opt to replace the entire iPhone for the cost of a battery replacement if the iPhone’s battery tabs are broken or missing, or there is excessive adhesive present. While this is an improvement to Apple’s historically closed-off approach to repairs, repairs for third-party components such as logic boards, enclosures, Lightning connectors, and more will still be declined.
