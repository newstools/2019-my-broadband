Nedbank has become the first bank in South Africa to incorporate a virtual assistant into its banking app. HeyNed, a digital virtual personal assistant and concierge service, uses a network of more than 350,000 product and service providers. HeyNed also negotiates better prices on a user’s behalf. Once a Nedbank MoneyApp user accepts the quote provided to them by HeyNed, payment can be made automatically through the Nedbank app. “HeyNed users appreciate the fact that the service pays for itself through the savings it delivers and that it can be used to source items and access a host of value-adding services,” said managing executive of retail and business banking Ciko Thomas. HeyNed is free for the first three months to new home loan clients using the Nedbank Money app. Thereafter, a monthly subscription fee of R99 will apply. Nedbank has also released a new Home-Buying Toolkit to make life easier for prospective home buyers. “For most people, a home is likely to be the biggest, most expensive purchase they will ever make, which is why Nedbank has created this feature-rich toolkit,” said Thomas. Both of these new tools are available on Nedbank’s MoneyApp.
