Vox has launched a new “unlimited email archiving solution” which provides a way for companies to protect their email data. Craig Freer, executive head of cloud and managed services at Vox, said it has become “far too commonplace for companies to lose email”. Freer said many email platforms have a limited amount of storage, which results in users having to delete old emails on a regular basis. “Through our unlimited archiving solution, we are offering companies of all sizes an affordable plug-and-play solution that enables them to retain 10 years’ email irrespective of how much data that is.” Vox said its offering integrates into any email platform.
