Amazon has announced an “all-new Kindle” that will allow users to read in the dark for a significantly cheaper price than the Kindle Paperwhite. This new Kindle is listed for $89.99 on Amazon’s store and is due to be released on 10 April. It comes with a glare-free, 167 ppi, 6-inch display and improved electronic ink technology that offers better contrast to users. “Customers consistently tell us how much they appreciate having a front light on Kindle devices so they can read in any environment – from a sunny patio to their bed at night,” said Kevin Keith, VP of Amazon Devices. “The team worked hard to bring this customer-favorite feature to our most affordable device.” The new Kindle will be available in black and white, while covers will be available for $29.99.
