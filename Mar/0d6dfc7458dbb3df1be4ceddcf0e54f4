Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has officially removed Rubben Mohlaloga from his positions as ICASA chairperson and councillor with immediate effect. Mohlaloga was convicted of fraud and money laundering in January 2018, and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in February 2019. Section 6(1) of the ICASA Act states that a councillor convicted of fraud is disqualified from holding office. Mohlaloga was suspended on 15 March pending the conclusion of the National Assemblyâ€™s investigation of the matter. The National Assembly resolved to remove Mohlaloga from his position on 19 March, with Ndabeni-Abrahams making the removal official. In accordance with the ICASA Act, the body will elect an acting chairperson to run ICASA in the interim. The process to appoint a long-term replacement for Mohlaloga will begin shortly.
