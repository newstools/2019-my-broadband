Nvidia has announced that it will implement ray tracing on mid to high-end GTX graphics cards. DirectX Raytracing (DXR) will be available on GeForce GTX 1060 6GB and higher GPUs. “The much larger install base of RT-capable GPUs will fuel developer adoption of ray tracing technology, bringing more games for both GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX users to experience,” said Nvidia in a press release. The new feature will become available through a driver update which is expected to launch in April 2019. However, don’t expect the feature to work as well as it does on Nvidia’s new RTX graphics cards. RTX cards have dedicated RT cores that perform the various calculations needed for ray tracing, whereas GTX cards will perform these calculations on shader cores, sharing space with other GPU functions. This means that GTX card owners who use ray tracing will likely need to do so at lower quality settings and resolutions, with RTX cards expected to perform 2-3x faster than the GTX range when using this technology.
