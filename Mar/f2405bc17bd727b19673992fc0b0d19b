Tesla has announced that it is going to shut down most of its physical stores over the “next few months” and switch to an online-only model. Moving to an ecommerce model is expected to be both a financial and practical decision – allowing Tesla to reduce costs while avoiding dealing with local legislation and politics. “Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average,” said Tesla in a blog post. According to CEO Elon Musk, Tesla will keep “a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases, and Tesla information centers.” Tesla has also announced that it will launch more service centres to cope with demand from its increasing customer base. The goal is to offer “same-day, if not same-hour service”, while guaranteeing service availability in all of the countries in which it operates.
