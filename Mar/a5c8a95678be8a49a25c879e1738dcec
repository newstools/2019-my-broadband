Intel and the United States Department of Energy have partnered to build the world’s first exascale computer. An exascale computer is a machine with performance in excess of one exaFLOP (1,000,000 teraFLOPS). Intel’s exascale supercomputer will be named “Aurora” and will be used to advance scientific research and discovery in the fields of cancer research, climate modeling, and health treatments. Aurora will be able to handle traditional high-performance computing in addition to artificial intelligence workloads, making it a versatile machine able to tackle a variety of computing problems. “Today is an important day not only for the team of technologists and scientists who have come together to build our first exascale computer – but also for all of us who are committed to American innovation and manufacturing,” said Intel CEO Bob Swan. The contract is valued at over $500 million and will be delivered to the department’s Argonne National Laboratory by Intel and sub-contractor Cray Computing in 2021.
