Samsung recently launched its new Galaxy S10 lineup of smartphones in South Africa, offering next-generation hardware paired with an exciting new design. The new smartphones are now available in four models – the Galaxy S10e, S10, S10+, and S10 5G. All these devices are high-end, premium smartphones with impressive features and innovative designs. This is especially true when you compare the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ to their previous-generation counterparts. The new smartphones have Dynamic OLED displays which sport Samsung’s new Infinity-O design, marking a clear innovative leap made by the smartphone manufacturer over the last year. Samsung’s Galaxy S10 has dropped the capacitive fingerprint sensor on the back of the smartphone in favour of an in-screen ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. The Galaxy S10 now sports the same triple-lens camera system present on the S10+ and the bigger device now has two front-facing camera lenses in its cut-out notch. Perhaps one of the biggest improvements is under the hood however, with both the Galaxy S10 and S10+ getting serious hardware upgrades over the previous models. Where the Samsung Galaxy S9 had 4GB of RAM, the Galaxy S10 boasts 10GB, along with double the maximum internal storage. The new smartphones also support Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, delivering next-generation wireless connectivity to your handheld device. For many power users, the selling points of the Galaxy S10 over the Galaxy 9 range would be the greatly-improved battery size and the reverse wireless charging functionality, which allows you to charge your Galaxy Buds while your smartphone charges at the same time. It is apparent from the range of cutting-edge features implemented in the new Galaxy S10 range that these devices are a leap ahead of the previous models, making them the perfect upgrade for any Samsung fan. Below is a hardware comparison of the Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10+ against their previous models. <img class="size-full wp-image-297912 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/S10-VS-S9.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/S10-VS-S9.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/S10-VS-S9-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/S10-VS-S9-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-297914 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/S10-VS-S9-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/S10-VS-S9-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/S10-VS-S9-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/S10-VS-S9-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This article was published in partnership with Samsung.
