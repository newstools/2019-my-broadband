Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, announced that development has started on Linux kernel 5.1. “It’s Sunday, and two weeks have passed, and everything is normal,” said Torvalds. “You all know the drill by now – the merge window is closed, and things are supposed to calm down.” Torvalds said that the merge window for Linux kernel 5.1 was “fairly normal” with no big outliers or oddities. As a result, the first Release Candidate of Linux kernel 5.1 is now ready for testing. According to Torvalds, the release is of a regular size, with just over 60% of it constituting drivers. The final version of 5.1 is expected to launch in May, with either 5 May or 12 May being touted. The first Release Candidate can be downloaded from kernel.org.
