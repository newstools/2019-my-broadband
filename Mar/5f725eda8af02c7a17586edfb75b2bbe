ICASA has announced the appointment of executive board member Dr Keabetswe Modimoeng as its acting chairperson. Modimoeng holds MBA and PhD degrees in management sciences. He is also a Harvard senior executive fellow and has completed both an executive development programme from Wharton University and an Africa director programme from Stellenbosch University. “We will continue to work closely with all key stakeholders (including government) to ensure that the authority’s regulatory decisions advance transformation in the ICT sector, support economic growth and unlock opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the digital economy,” said Modimoeng. Modimoeng’s appointment follows the removal of fraud-convicted ICASA chairperson Rubben Mohlaloga. The process to appoint a permanent chairperson is expected to begin shortly.
