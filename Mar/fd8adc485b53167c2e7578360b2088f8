Update: Uber said the fee change will not take effect in South Africa, and the Uber Eats flat-rate delivery structure remains the same. Uber Eats is rolling out a new fee structure which completely removes booking fees. In a post on its Help page, Uber announced that from 18 March 2019, users will no longer be presented with booking fees on their Uber Eats orders. Uber Eats orders can now include delivery fees, service fees, and small order fees. Delivery fees vary for each restaurant based on things like your location and availability of nearby couriers, while service fees are equal to 15% of an orderâ€™s subtotal and do not apply to restaurants which deliver their own orders. Uber said the new fee structure helps cover delivery costs and keeps couriers on the road so your food can arrive quickly and reliably.
