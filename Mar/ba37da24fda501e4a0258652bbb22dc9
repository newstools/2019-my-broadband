Tesla Inc. is updating its charging network to halve typical wait times as the Model 3 fleet grows larger and rivals like Porsche ready their own powerful infrastructure. After doubling power at Tesla’s stations and vehicles preheating batteries ahead of arriving at a plug, charging times will drop to around 15 minutes, the electric-car leader said on its blog. The rollout of the V3 Supercharging network will take until the end of the year and allow twice as many cars each day to charge. The first V3 Supercharger site that’s not a test version will break ground next month. After rolling out in North America, the technology will reach Europe and the Asia-Pacific region in the fourth quarter, the company said. The push will take Tesla’s network to delivering 250 kilowatts, up from 120 kw as more fast-charging infrastructure is built. Tesla faces a wave of competition with incumbent carmakers readying their lineups of electric vehicles. They’re also getting on the front foot in charging. Ionity GmbH, a consortium of Volkswagen AG, Mercedes Benz-maker Daimler AG, Ford Motor Co. and BMW AG, will have 400 station across Europe’s major highways with 350 kw capacity by the middle of next year. Volkswagen is helming a similar effort in the U.S. and VW brand Porsche, starting sales of the electric Taycan later this year, is separately adding 350 kw chargers to its dealerships in the U.S. and Europe ahead of a broader electric rollout.
