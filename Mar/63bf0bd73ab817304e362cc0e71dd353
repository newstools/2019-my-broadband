Certain Internet Solutions clients are experiencing a prolonged service outage, according to several customers who contacted MyBroadband. One reader said they have been experiencing issues for over a week and when he called the company’s contact centre an automated message stated that there was an outage which was being investigated. Another reader stated that his company is using Internet Solutions for their cloud-based servers, and their server has been down since 18 March 2019. He said calling the company’s contact centre did not yield a solution to his problem. Following questions from MyBroadband, Internet Solutions said it experienced hard disc failures on its Consumer Virtual Machine environment last week – resulting in certain clients having limited or no access to their services. “While every effort is being made to restore the environment to optimal operation, clients are currently being migrated to an alternative virtual machine environment to address their immediate service requirements,” said Internet Solutions.
