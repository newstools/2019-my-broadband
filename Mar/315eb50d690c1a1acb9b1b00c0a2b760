Cell C’s streaming service Black has introduced two new subscription packages. The two packages are as follows: “In our efforts to create a seamless user experience for our subscribers, it was very important to consider our package structure,” said Precious Nkabinde, PR manager for Black. “Furthermore, in an ever changing economy we are particularly committed to providing affordable entertainment for the whole family and you will see this through the significant reduction in subscription fees.” The company stated that customers can also opt into a Fox+ or National Geographic+ subscription – available for R69 per month – without an active subscription on the two primary packages. “The Fox+ and National Geographic+ package is exclusive to Black and has video-on-demand content from Fox and National Geographic, including The Americans, Empire, The Walking Dead, Mars, and Natural Disasters.” It added that soccer fans can opt into club channels, including Barca TV, Real Madrid TV, Liverpool TV, Chelsea TV, and Manchester United TV – available as daily, weekly, and monthly subscriptions. Other services which have not changed include movie rentals at R25 each.
