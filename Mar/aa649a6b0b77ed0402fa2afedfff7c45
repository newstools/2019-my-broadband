A video by Slashleaks shows a new pop-up front camera design that is reportedly being used in the Oppo Reno smartphone. In the video, when the user selects the front camera, the lens – shaped as a right-angle triangle – pops up. Slashleaks has also published a leaked render of the Reno’s case. Oppo has been experimenting with different pop-out and sliding camera styles of late, including the pop-up camera on the Oppo Find X. This design also increases the size of Oppo’s pop-up camera and allowed it to include flash capabilities. No specifications, pricing, or release date has been detailed for the Oppo Reno.
