The memory and storage specifications on the Watch GT are not as impressive as its competitors, but its battery life is a leap ahead of the competition. Whereas the Galaxy Watch and Apple Watch Series 4 promise “days of power”, the Watch GT boasts up to two weeks on a single charge. The other smartwatches do have their own advantages however, with Samsung offering support for its Samsung Pay platform on the Galaxy Watch. This allows Samsung Pay users to make contactless payments at NFC-compatible terminals by tapping their smartwatch on the POS machine after linking the device to the Pay app on their smartphone. Apple’s Watch Series 4 retains the design and features of Apple’s previous-generation model while also offering haptic feedback and a new electrical heart sensor capable of ECG measurements. All of these features cater to different users, and the wide variety of functionality offered by modern wearables means that each buyer will want something different.
