Ride-hailing company Taxify is renaming itself as Bolt. Bolt is the name the business has been using for its electric scooter service, and it will now be used for all the company’s offerings. The name change also moves away from the idea that the business is a car-only ride-hailing company, by removing the word “taxi”. The company plans to add more vehicles like scooters to its service list, while it also plans on entering the public transport market in the future. The name Bolt further reflects the company’s focus on both electric vehicles and speed, said CEO Markus Villig. “We are bullish that the future is fully electric and so we wanted a name that moved us away from the combustion engine,” said Villig. Bolt has 25 million users in 30 countries across Europe and Africa.
