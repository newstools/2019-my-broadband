A study by AV-Comparatives has found that only 80 of the 250 antivirus apps in the Google Play Store that it tested provide any amount of substantial benefit. AV-Comparatives uses “defence against 30% of malicious apps” as a cut off point for an antivirus program providing substantial value to users. This means that 170 of the apps it tested did not meet this requirement. “Less than one in 10 of the apps tested defended against all 2,000 malicious apps,” said AV-Comparatives. AV-Comparatives added that apps being updated regularly isn’t a clear indication that they will provide protection, as many of the low-scoring apps in its test had recent updates. “Because of this, we recommend using only apps of well-known, verified, and reputable vendors.” “As well as participating in tests by independent institutes, such vendors will have a professional website with contact information and a privacy policy.”
