Mozilla has announced that Firefox Send – its encrypted file-sharing platform – has exited its beta stage and is now available to all users. Firefox Send allows users to share files from any browser, using end-to-end encryption to secure the data. The platform also allows users to set an expiry time for when the file link they created expires, as well as selecting how many users can download the files. Users can also set a password which others will be required to enter before downloading the shared files through the Firefox Send service. Send allows users to share files of up to 1GB, and users will need to sign up for a Firefox account to send up to 2.5GB through the platform. This platform was first announced as a Test Pilot experiment in 2017. Mozilla said that Send will also be available as an Android app in beta later this week.
