MTN has told MyBroadband that it will enable VoLTE on certain iPhones from 1 April 2019. The mobile network launched VoLTE support in South Africa in September 2018, but limited the use of this technology to select smartphones. Apple iPhones will now be added to the list of smartphones that can use VoLTE. MTN did not specify which iPhone models will be able to use VoLTE to make calls. MyBroadband readers have also reported that VoLTE is already available on their iPhones, following them updating their operating system to iOS 12.2.
