Daylight Saving Time (DST) is a phenomenon practiced around the world, which has no beneficial effect on society or productivity. As explained by The Verge, DST was started after Benjamin Franklin commented on the early rising of the sun in the spring months. The practice of setting clocks one hour forward at the start of spring and adjusting them back in autumn has been implemented across many regions of the world from as early as 1916. DST was aimed at improving energy efficiency, but modern studies have found it has the opposite effect – resulting in more energy usage than if it was ignored completely. In addition to the futility of implementing DST to save energy, the Better Sleep Council found that Americans suffer mild fatigue and sleep deprivation due to the unnecessary loss of an hour of sleep. While many people still advocate the practice of DST, research shows that it has no positive effect on productivity or energy consumption, and may result in the increased occurrence of fatigue and sleep deprivation. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
