Eskom has announced that it will continue stage 2 load-shedding until Sunday. The risk of load-shedding being implemented also remains high until the middle of next week, added Eskom. It said the reasons for the power cuts were plant breakdowns and a need to manage diesel and water reserves. This resource management is required to mitigate the risk of load-shedding in the coming week. Eskom asked citizens to use electricity sparingly.
