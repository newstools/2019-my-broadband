Huge Group has acquired independent telco Otel, and will be merging it with its subsidiary Huge Networks. Otel is a nationwide VoIP provider and offers broadband infrastructure-as-a-service telecommunications solutions. “We believe that the merger will enable us to extend our customer value proposition and give us access to a huge real estate of customers,” said Otel CEO Rad Jankovic. “We have already identified several areas of growth and the backing of Huge Group will unlock these growth initiatives.” “Huge Group continues to focus on unlocking opportunities through the strategic acquisition of successful and complementary subsidiary operations,” said James Herbst, CEO of Huge Group. The deal was implemented on 14 March 2019, and the Otel brand will be migrated to the Huge Networks brand during the course of 2019.
