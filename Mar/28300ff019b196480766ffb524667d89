Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus all suffered substantial downtime last night, reports The Verge. Issues suffered by users varied from troubles sending messages on Messenger, to not being able to post to their feeds. Facebook tweeted that it was aware of the issues, and was working on resolving them. It added that the issues were not caused by a DDoS attack. Instagram and Oculus also tweeted about the problems, although the former has since said that its services have returned to normal. Those who tried to use Facebook to sign into other apps like Tinder or Spotify also suffered issues as a result of the outage.
