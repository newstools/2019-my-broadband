The United States Federal Communications Commission has unanimously voted to open up terahertz-wave spectrum which could be used to deliver 6G wireless services. The spectrum falls between the 96GHz to 3THz range, and will be made open for engineers to experiment with next-generation wireless networks. This spectrum range could be used to deliver high-speed Internet for applications with high bandwidth requirements, such as high-resolution imaging, and will remain available for a period of 10 years. The FCC also made a total of 21.2GHz of spectrum available for use by unlicensed devices, selecting bands with propagation characteristics which permit large numbers of unlicensed devices to access the spectrum while reducing interference with existing operations in the above-95GHz bands. “The First Report and Order provides unprecedented opportunities for new experimental and unlicensed use in the frequencies above 95GHz and will help ensure that the United States stays at the forefront of wireless innovation,” said the FCC. US operators are only now beginning to roll out 5G services, but the FCC plans for the country to continue experimenting with next-generation technologies.
