UK bank NatWest is testing a new debit card that uses a built-in fingerprint scanner as a replacement for a PIN. Fingerprint data is stored within the card, meaning that hackers cannot steal the data from a bank’s database. Currently, due to the “ease with which NFC cards can be used fraudulently”, this form of payment is subject to a £30 limit in the UK. However, NatWest’s proposed card would potentially allow for this limit to be removed. To register their fingerprint, customers will need to visit a bank branch – although Gemalto, the company behind the technology, hopes that users will be able to use their phones to do this in the future. This technology was previously tested by Mastercard in South Africa back 2017, but did not catch on.
