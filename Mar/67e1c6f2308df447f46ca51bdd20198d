Apple recently unveiled its new iMacs, which boast powerful hardware and stunning displays. In fact, the top-end iMac available in the US packs a 9th-Gen Intel Core i9 CPU, AMD Radeon Pro Vega 48 8GB GPU, 64GB DDR4 RAM, a 2TB SSD, and a 27-inch 5K display. South African pricing for the new iMac was revealed soon after the international launch, with the iStore offering several models locally for pre-order. The top model available from the iStore falls well short of the iMac we mentioned above, but it still packs impressive specifications. For R41,499 you can order a 27-inch iMac which features: Customers will also receive a Magic Keyboard and a Magic Mouse 2, taking care of all peripheral needs. To see how this iMac stacks up against a Windows PC, we took the R41,499 price tag and built a machine on paper – using pricing from local retailers. The table below details the build, which was put together to match the performance and specifications of the 27-inch iMac as closely as possible. It must be noted that the keyboard, mouse, and monitor selected for the Windows PC build were among the most expensive on offer and made up a significant chunk of the total price. This is due to the fact that they must replicate the performance of Apple’s Magic mouse and keyboard – both high-end, wireless devices which offer a range of unique features when integrated with the iMac macOS operating system. On the matter of operating systems, the Windows 10 Home price detailed in the table is for an OEM key – not a retail licence. Finally, the display in the Windows PC build is a Samsung monitor with a 3,840 x 2,160 resolution, 1ms response time, and AMD FreeSync support – slightly down in terms of raw specifications compared to the iMac display, but it should deliver great visuals for professional users.
