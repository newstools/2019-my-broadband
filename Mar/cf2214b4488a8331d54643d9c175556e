Apple recently launched its credit card, called Apple Card. “Apple Card is built into the Apple Wallet app on iPhone, offering customers a familiar experience with Apple Pay and the ability to manage their card right on iPhone,” said the company. For instances where Apple Pay is not accepted, Apple offers users a physical Apple credit card. Made from titanium and not featuring a card number, CVV security code, expiration date, or signature, it embodies everything that makes Apple products cool and desirable. However, it falls short in an area many South Africans will expect a bank card to function in: the ability to “tap and pay”. Mastercard, who helped Apple with their card, confirmed to The Verge that while it has a chip and magnetic stripe for payments, it does not support contactless payments. For users who want to pay for an item online with the card, a card number and CVV can be generated in Apple’s Wallet app, added the report.
