Vivo showcased its new Apex 2019 concept smartphone at an event in Hong Kong, The Verge reports. The Apex 2019’s chassis is devoid of any openings, and the device is shaped out of a single piece of glass – which relies on capacitive and pressure sensors to simulate the presence of buttons. There is no dedicated speaker on the smartphone either, with the display vibrating to produce sound instead. Vivo’s Apex 2019 features an in-screen fingerprint scanner which is accessible from almost the entire front display, and the handset boasts 5G network capabilities. While Vivo showed of a working model of the Apex 2019 smartphone at the event, the company reportedly stated that it was a concept device which would not officially go on sale. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298922" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Vivo-Apex-2019.jpg" alt="Vivo Apex 2019" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Vivo-Apex-2019.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Vivo-Apex-2019-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Vivo-Apex-2019-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
