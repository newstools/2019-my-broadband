Stacy Spikes, a founder of MoviePass, is launching a new service that gives users free movie tickets if they watch adverts. Called PreShow, users will be shown 15-20 minutes of adverts while facial recognition software tracks how much attention they pay to the ads. Spikes has launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund her project, and at the time of writing it had raised $15,892 of its $10,000 goal. “PreShow is a cutting-edge, advertiser-supported platform – first of its kind. If you love movies in theatres, and you love real value – welcome to PreShow,” states its Kickstarter page. The platform can be accessed through a smartphone app and the device’s facial recognition software. After a user has watched the ads, a virtual card in the app is credited with a movie ticket of their choice. The service is currently only accepting “invited” users.
