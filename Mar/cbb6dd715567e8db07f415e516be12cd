By Cheryl Otstott Security breaches are constantly in the news. From hacks, to breaches to identity theft it is an ongoing battle to secure your information. Every time a vulnerability is identified for a Xerox printer or multifunction printer processes are in place to fix it and post the fix in a timely manner. It is important to keep up with news of threats and understand what you need to know and watch for when it comes to securing your data. So when was the last time you checked the Xerox Security website for any updates or patches for your Xerox equipment? We try to make it easy to find all the information and resources you need to help you meet your security goals. We know that the security of your information is important to you and it is important to Xerox. We will provide you with the tools to safeguard your information, but it is up to you and / or your IT staff to utilize these tools. Please subscribe to or check our Security webpage periodically to keep updated on any new security information. Information is posted as required and will be product specific or generic depending on the issue. Simply navigate over to the Security webpage and select the model of your machine to see any updates or patches available for your product.  You will also find news as well as Security Resources and information about the Xerox Security Model. The “Contact Us” section is a link to a form (see below) where you can report vulnerabilities, request information and submit questions.  Another feature of this page is the See all Security Bulletins link near the top of the page that will list in chronological order all the security bulletins that have been released.  <img class="size-large wp-image-299070 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Request-form-640x261.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="261" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Request-form-640x261.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Request-form-600x245.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Request-form.jpg 759w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Remember knowledge is power when it comes to security. So, another resource to review is the Xerox Product Security Frequently Asked Questions page. Please review all these resources to stay up to date with security features, updates, upgrades and tips. This is the proverbial “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink”. Please take the “drink”, the information you will safeguard is your own. Our goal is to help you keep your information secure. Online Support also has information about security. You can search on “security” to find out what you need to do or what you can do to protect your information on your particular printer. Please look over the information provided and contact Xerox with any issues, questions or concerns. In this digital data age security is everyone’s responsibility, do your part to secure your important data. For more information, visit the Bytes Document Solutions website.
