Following the launch of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX graphics cards, laptop manufacturers began to implement the powerful hardware in their high-end products. These new laptops pack even more power than the previous-generation notebooks with GTX 10 Series graphics, while remaining slim and portable. Notebooks like the ASUS ROG Strix SCAR II are the perfect example of this innovation – thin and portable, while boasting powerful hardware. ASUS was kind enough to lend us a ROG Strix SCAR II to test this week, and we were impressed with the lightweight design and power of the device. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-297552" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-4.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Strix Scar II 4" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-4.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-4-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-4-573x430.jpg 573w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Beneath its brushed metal chassis and configurable RGB lighting, the ASUS ROG Strix SCAR II has some serious firepower. By combining a hexa-core Intel Core i7 8th-generation processor with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 graphics card, the laptop comes prepared for any gaming situation. The laptop also packs an awesome 17.3-inch Full HD IPS display with 3ms response time and 144Hz refresh rate, making the notebook ideal for competitive and casual gamers.

Gaming on the high-refresh-rate display with the ultra-low response time feels extremely smooth and fluid, and there is no delay between your actions and what you see on the screen. We have also played on a lot of high-end gaming laptops, and they have historically been bulky and difficult to carry around. The SCAR II solves this problem by maintaining a slim, portable chassis which looks more like an ultrabook than a traditional bulky gaming laptop. ASUS has also implemented an ultra-thin bezel around the 17.3-inch display, making the SCAR II as lightweight and as stylish as possible. Thow in the high number of RGB LED lighting zones and cool ROG logos, and you have a gaming rig worth of attending any LAN or gaming session. The ASUS ROG Strix SCAR II model we tested retails in South Africa for around R39,000. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297550" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-3.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Strix Scar II 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Scar-II-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
