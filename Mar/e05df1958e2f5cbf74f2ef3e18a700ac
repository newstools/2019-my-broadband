Microsoft’s new disc-less console is expected to launch in May this year, according to a report by Windows Central. The upcoming console has been in development for a while under the code name “Xbox Maverick”, but it will reportedly be named the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition at launch. Pre-orders for the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition will open in mid-April, with the product expected to launch in almost all existing Xbox markets in May 2019, the report said. This console will not include a physical disc drive, saving on the added cost of a Blu-Ray drive while also allowing Microsoft to test the concept behind its next-generation Xbox consoles. Previous reports have stated that Microsoft will forgo physical media for its next generation of gaming consoles, relying instead on downloads and streaming for media delivery.
