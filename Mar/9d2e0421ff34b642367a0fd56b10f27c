Samsung is preparing to launch a new flagship device which it will price cheaper than its Galaxy S10e smartphone, Softpedia News reports. The device will reportedly be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and will be unveiled later this year. Rumours point to the device being the Galaxy A90, which will boast powerful specifications in addition to a single rotating 48-megapixel camera. As a cost-saving measure, the smartphone will feature an LCD display instead of an OLED panel. The chassis would opt for a plastic back over glass for the same reason, and the fingerprint sensor could be placed on the side of the smartphone. There is currently no official information available regarding this cheaper flagship.
