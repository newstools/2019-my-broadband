The 2019 Data Storage, Backup and Recovery Conference recently took place at The Venue in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg. This is a must-attend event for IT executives and IT professionals who are responsible for the IT systems of their companies. Attendees were addressed by industry experts who shared valuable information on data storage, data backup, disaster recovery, digital transformation, ransomware, and data protection. Johan Scheepers, Director of Systems Engineering MESAT at Commvault, spoke about the trends in data backup and recovery, the rapid growth in data volume and value, and how IT managers can equip themselves to stem the data wave. Scheepers said that, according to predictions by the IDC, the collective sum of the world’s data will grow from 33 zettabytes this year to a 175ZB by 2025, for a compounded annual growth rate of 61 percent. Looking at this prediction, it’s safe to say that data volumes have been hugely underestimated. As they grow, they become more unstructured, complicating data management and creating a bigger problem in meeting recovery time objectives. Looking at the velocity at which data grows, traditional backup is not enough. According to Scheepers, there are five reasons why traditional backup is on its way out. Fortunately, there is much that can be done to curb the impact that increasing valuable data can have on organisations. One of the key things that companies should look at is simplifying their data environment by consolidating backup and recovery tools from a single vendor. As a starting point, however, Scheepers highlighted five steps that IT professionals can follow to start taking control of their data. Commvault assists many organisations that are struggling with the knowledge of how much data they have, where it is, and what value it has.
