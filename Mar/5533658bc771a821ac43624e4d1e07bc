WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton recently spoke to an undergraduate computer science class at Stanford University, where he urged students to delete their Facebook accounts, BuzzFeed News reports. Acton spoke about how WhatsApp was founded and explained his decision to sell the messaging platform to Facebook in 2014. He also criticised the profit models used by major companies like Facebook and Google. “The capitalistic profit motive, or answering to Wall Street, is what’s driving the expansion of invasion of data privacy and driving the expansion of a lot of negative outcomes that we’re just not happy with,” Acton said. He added that companies like Facebook and Google are not equipped to curate their platforms properly and make decisions regarding which content is allowed. “These companies are not equipped to make these decisions, and we give them the power. That’s the bad part. We buy their products. We sign up for these websites. Delete Facebook, right?”
