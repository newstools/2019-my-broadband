Whether you’re gaming or editing videos, having a powerful GPU is important. Depending on your needs and budget, there are a wide variety of GPUs to choose from – but it can be difficult to work out which GPU best suits your needs, and your pocket. The two major players in the GPU market, Nvidia and AMD, both offer high-quality, powerful cards that are worthy of consideration. AMD’s most powerful gaming card at the moment is the Radeon VII, and is priced at R15,999 for the MSI version in South Africa. However, local suppliers such as Wootware and Rebel Tech have complained of massive stock supply shortages, meaning that this GPU is very difficult to source in South Africa. Nvidia’s equivalent flagship GPU is the RTX 2080, which starts at R15,000 in South Africa and outperforms the Radeon VII by some margin. To see how GPUs compare in terms of performance and price, we looked at Tom’s Hardware and its latest ranking system for cards available in 2019. The ranking system is based upon “the geometric mean frames per second” from tests on Far Cry 5, Forza Horizon 4, and Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation. Unsurprisingly, according to these rankings, the most powerful GPU available is the Nvidia Titan RTX – which makes sense given its 24GB of memory and $2,500 price tag. Interestingly, according to these rankings, Nvidia’s previous-generation 1080 Ti scores higher than AMD’s best GPU, the Radeon VII. These ranking have been combined with South African pricing for the cards – where available – in the table below.
