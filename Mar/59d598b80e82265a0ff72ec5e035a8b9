Cedric Miller has been announced as the new CFO of Altron Group. Miller, who will join the group on 1 May 2019, has more than 27 years’ financial and accounting experience – and has worked in global investment and retail banking. He is currently CFO for Standard Bank’s global personal and business banking unit and has worked as COO for the bank’s subsidiary in Argentina. “Cedric brings a wealth of knowledge to our company and his experience in the financial services is a distinct advantage,” said Mteto Nyati, Altron Group Chief Executive. “Given his track record in leading people and companies through periods of change, Cedric will be key to driving our growth.” Altron Group COO Andrew Holden, who had been acting CFO, will step down from this position at the end of April. “We would like to express our appreciation to Andrew, who assumed this additional role over the past few months,” said Nyati.
