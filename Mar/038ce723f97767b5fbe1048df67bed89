The next OnePlus flagship smartphone may ditch the notch for a mechanical pop-up camera, according to a leak from Steve Hemmerstoffer. Hemmerstoffer is a prolific technology leaker, posting images and renders of devices before they launch on a regular basis. The render he posted of the OnePlus 7 shows a bezel-less display without a notch or cut-out for the front-facing camera, with OnePlus instead resorting to a mechanical pop-up selfie camera to preserve screen-to-body ratio. According to the leak, the device will also sport three primary cameras on the back, along with a 6.5-inch display. OnePlus is expected to launch the next version of its flagship smartphone halfway through 2019. The images leaked by Hemmerstoffer through Pricebaba are below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298178" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus 7 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298180" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 7 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298182" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OnePlus-7-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
