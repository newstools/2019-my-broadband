Afrihost recently announced big price cuts to its 20Mbps uncapped ADSL bundles. The price cuts went up to 55% across business and premium packages, and include DSL line rental fees. “The new uncapped bundle pricing is available now on Afrihost’s website for new clients signing up for the first time. Existing clients already on eligible bundles have already been automatically migrated onto the new bundle pricing as of 1 March 2019,” said the ISP. To see how Afrihost’s new pricing compares against its competitors, we have listed 20Mbps uncapped ADSL packages from several local providers below. The packages listed fall into one of the three categories: home, premium, and business. Each package type offers users a different experience, with home accounts typically subject to fair usage policies and their traffic throttled during peak network times. Premium and business accounts are subject to less-stringent usage policies, or none at all, and real-time traffic on the packages is often not throttled during busy network times. The table below details the pricing of the packages compared. It must be noted that the pricing excludes Telkom landline rental.
