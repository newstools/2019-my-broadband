Amazon will close all of its 87 pop-up kiosks in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported. The stores allowed customers to try out and buy gadgets such as tablets and Echo speakers. “After much review, we came to the decision to discontinue our pop-up kiosk program,” Amazon told The Wall Street Journal. The company said it would close its pop-up kiosks by the end of April 2019. Amazon will continue to focus on its brick-and-mortar retail business however, including expanding its bookstores, grocery stores, and cashier-less Go retailers. The company’s Amazon Go retail stores do not have cashiers, requiring customers to install a smartphone app and then take items from the store to purchase them. Items are monitored via hundreds of cameras which track the location of products and charge the user’s account when they exit the store.
