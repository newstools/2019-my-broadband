The Sanral board of directors have passed a resolution to suspend the process of pursuing all e-toll debt. The move comes after an initiative led by President Cyril Ramaphosa regarding the addressing of e-tolls payment issues. As part of the resolution, all historic debt and summonses applied for from 2015 will also be suspended. “This decision will be constantly monitored by the board and reviewed according to prevailing circumstances,” said Sanral. It added that no new summonses would be applied for from this point forward. The Electronic Toll Collection company (ETC) recently said that e-toll users risk blacklisting if they don’t respond to letters and summonses over unpaid bills. This was brought on by many e-toll users refusing to pay their bills, and civil movement organisations instructing road users not to pay for e-tolls.
