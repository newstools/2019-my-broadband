Google has officially announced AMP for email, which will allow emails to be formatted and sent as AMP pages. AMP pages are designed as fast-loading web pages, aimed at mobile users. This new feature will allow for the design of more interactive emails due to users now having access to AMP components such as amp-carousel, amp-form, and amp-list. “Since it’s an open spec, we look forward to seeing other email clients adopt it, too,” said Google. This new feature will allow for email content to remain up-to-date and interactive due to the dynamic nature of AMP pages. Alongside the release of AMP for email, Google will also launch the Gmail Developer Preview for the new feature – which will allow those who build AMP emails to test them within the Gmail platform before sending them. AMP for email will be supported in Gmail later this year, Google said.
