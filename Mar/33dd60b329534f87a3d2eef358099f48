Eskom implemented stage 4 load-shedding this weekend, blaming the “loss of an additional 900MW from Mozambique imports” for the electricity shortage. Damage caused by tropical cyclone Idai means that both high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) lines from the Cahora-Bassa hydroelectric generation station to the Apollo substation in Gauteng are down. The estimated time to restore these links is not known because the damaged lines are inaccessible and the extent of the damage is unknown. While this is a devastating blow to Eskom, which is already struggling to cope with demand, it is by no means its only challenge. Energy expect Chris Yelland warned that Eskom is facing many immediate problems which extend far beyond the Cahora-Bassa lines. These problems include: Yelland has provided five short-term, quick-win solutions to current load shedding which are easy to implement.
