Eskom has announced that it will continue with load-shedding over the entire weekend, following stage 4 load-shedding on Saturday 16 March. The power utility said that load-shedding would shift from stage 4 to stage 2 from 23:00 on Saturday to 08:00 on Sunday morning, following which stage 4 load-shedding would be implemented from 08:00 until 23:00 on Sunday. “Unfortunately, even with the implementation of stage 4 load-shedding today, Eskom experienced a further decline in water reserves, which was used to supplement generation capacity,” Eskom stated. The implementation of stage 4 load-shedding on Saturday was attributed by Eskom to the loss of capacity which included imports from Mozambique. “Eskom’s maintenance teams are hard at work at our power stations in order to return units to the system,” the power utility stated.
