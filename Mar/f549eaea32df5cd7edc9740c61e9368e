Huawei has officially unveiled its new range of P30 flagship smartphones at a launch event in Paris. The company revealed its P30 and P30 Pro smartphones at the event, which both include powerful new features. A demo area was also installed at the event, allowing media to try out the new smartphones. MyBroadband attended the international launch as a guest of Huawei South Africa, and were given a device – the P30 Pro – to test at the event. From its curved OLED display to its bezel-less design and powerful CPU, the Huawei P30 Pro is a premium handset in every respect. The in-screen fingerprint sensor works flawlessly and the back of the device looks cleaner without a dedicated capacitive sensor in the middle. Over and above the impressive features, the Pro model adds a curved glass display, wireless charging, a TOF camera lens for improved bokeh shots, and the ability to charge other devices wirelessly. The smartphone’s front almost lacks any bezel, with only a small circular front camera notch infringing on the OLED display. One of the most impressive features of the device is its camera system and the quad-lens camera on the rear of the P30 Pro is a powerful tool for taking a variety of shots – from low-light landscapes to ultra-zoomed shots of distant objects. The selfie camera is great too, with the 32MP sensor capturing sharp, clear images with great colour accuracy. Huawei is shipping its P30 Pro device in a variety of colours, including the popular Aurora finish. The smartphone’s operating system is responsive and easy to use, with EMUI 9.1 – based on Android 9.0 – offering clean and efficient navigation while integrating well with a number of applications. Huawei’s P30 and P30 Pro smartphones are priced at R11,499 and R16,499 respectively, according to listings from South African retailers.
