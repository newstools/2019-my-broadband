The chair of the council of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), Rubben Mohlaloga, must be removed from his position immediately. This is according to a resolution adopted by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Communications. After considering the conviction and sentencing of Mohlaloga, the committee adopted a resolution that he be removed in terms of section 8 of the ICASA Act. “Having deliberated on the issue of the chairperson of ICASA, the committee has once more emphasised that he should be removed as a chairperson and also removed as council member of ICASA, as it is in the Act of ICASA that a person who is found guilty cannot hold the position of a councillor,” said the chair of the Parliamentary committee, Hlengiwe Mkhize. The committee allowed Mohlaloga an opportunity to make representations on why he should not be removed. Among other things, he indicated that he would be launching an appeal to his conviction. Despite his intent to appeal, the committee resolved that Mohlaloga should be removed from his post due to seriousness of the crime he has been convicted of. Mohlaloga was sentenced to an effective 20-year imprisonment for money laundering and fraud by the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in February. He was appointed as an ICASA councillor in 2013, despite being accused of defrauding the Land Bank of R6 million at the time. Mohlaloga was arrested and charged in October 2012, and was subsequently released on bail. The Constitutional and Legal Services Office for the Portfolio Committee said in 2013 that Mohlaloga is presumed innocent and fit to take up the position, as he had yet to face the charges in court.
