Huawei has developed its own operating systems for PCs and smartphones in case it loses access to Windows and Android. A Huawei spokesperson confirmed to the South China Morning Post that it has its own backup OS in case it is cut off from Google’s Android operating system. The United States previously banned ZTE from using American products, which crippled the manufacturer due to its reliance on foreign components and software. As tensions increase between Huawei and the United States government, Huawei has accommodated for all eventualities by preparing its own operating systems. Huawei stated that it will only use this software in a worst-case scenario and plans to continue using Android and Windows on its smartphones and computers respectively. This means that unless the United States implements a similar sanction on Huawei as it did on ZTE, nothing should change with regards to the software installed. “We fully support our partners’ operating systems – we love them and our customers love them,” said Huawei.
