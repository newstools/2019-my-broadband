MyBroadband has launched the latest version of its popular speed test app, which now gives you the opportunity to rate your mobile operator and ISP. MyBroadband’s Android and iOS Speed Test apps have been downloaded by over 50,000 South Africans, who use it to test the performance of their mobile networks. MyBroadband’s Speed Test platform was developed specifically for South Africa, and all tests are done to independent servers hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres. The latest version of the app has added a new feature: the ability to rate your mobile operator or your Internet service provider after you have completed a speed test. These ratings will be used in MyBroadband’s quarterly reports which rank mobile operators and Internet service providers. You can win prizes worth R5,000 by conducting a speed test and rating your data provider. Here’s what you should do: The giveaway ends on Monday 18 March 2019.
