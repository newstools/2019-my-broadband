Cell C has partnered with Facebook to launch the first public access Wi-Fi hotspots at the University of the Western Cape (UWC). The Wi-Fi hotspots are supported by the Facebook Express Wi-Fi platform, which Cell C said would help it deliver affordable and high-speed Internet to South Africans. “As an innovative business, Cell C is continuously looking for ways to bring affordable, super-fast Internet access to South Africans,” said Cell C CEO Douglas Craigie Stevenson. “This partnership with Facebook is an ideal way to ensure that we live up to that commitment.” Facebook and Cell C have a long-standing partnership, with Cell C being the first mobile operator in South Africa to offer FreeBasics, added the company. Cell C said additional rollout of the public access Wi-Fi hotspots across Cape Town will provide access to anyone within the public Wi-Fi areas, and more would be announced once the city’s municipality has approved additional rollout areas.
