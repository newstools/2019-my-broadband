Energy expert Ted Blom has urged South Africans to join forces and fight Eskom’s latest price increases. Energy regulator Nersa recently granted Eskom a 9.41% price increase for 2019/2020, which will kick in on 1 April. This price hike will be followed by another 8.10% increase in 2020/2021 and a 5.83% increase in 2021/2022. Speaking to SABC News, Blom slated these price increases – calling them “ill founded” and defective. Blom said Nersa told him at the public hearings on Eskom’s tariff applications that the application was defective. “What I think is that South Africans need to get together and take the matter to the high court to declare the price increase defective and have it taken away,” said Blom. He argued that citizens cannot pay more for a less-reliable electricity supply from Eskom. “Most people do not realise that more than half of their Eskom charges are for line availability or line capacity, and the stuff is not available. So, what are we paying for?” asked Blom. He invited people who are concerned about the matter to contact him and raise some money to take the matter to the high court. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
