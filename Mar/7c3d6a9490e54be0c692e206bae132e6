Consumer Reports has ranked the Samsung Galaxy S10+ as the best smartphone on the market. “What puts the S10+ on top is the exceptional way it performs the basics. It has the longest battery life in our ratings, excellent cameras, and the durability to withstand the physical abuses of daily life,” stated the report. “It also gets a boost from Samsung’s strong performance in the ratings for brand predicted reliability and owner satisfaction.” The report said the phone lasted 39.5 hours per charge in tests, and was no worse for wear after being subjected to “100 drops” in a metal chamber. One of the few criticisms Consumer Reports had was that the Galaxy S10+ should have a better front-facing camera. They found that it didn’t take great bokeh photos compared to other models. Despite the phone taking top spot in its rankings, Consumer Reports stated that it may be a good idea to wait until Samsung’s 5G version of the S10 launches before buying a new phone.
