Crytek has released a video outlining its system that allows non-RTX GPUs to utilise ray tracing in up to 4K 30fps quality. The demo, labeled “Neon Noir”, shows two minutes of 4K 30FPS gameplay using an AMD Radeon Vega 56 where all reflections use ray tracing. “The experimental ray tracing feature based on CryEngine’s Total Illumination used to create the demo is both API and hardware agnostic, enabling ray tracing to run on most mainstream, contemporary AMD and Nvidia GPUs,” said Crytek in a statement. Crytek will implement this technology into its CryEngine once it is fully developed, allowing game developers to build games that use ray tracing for free. Additionally, the technology will be optimised to benefit from performance enhancements delivered by the latest GPUs, as well as supported APIs like DX12. Watch the Neon Noir video below.
