Tesla has unveiled its Model Y, a new compact SUV that will be released in 2020. The Model Y can accelerate from 0-96km/h in 3.5 seconds, and has a range of 480km. There will initially be three versions of the Model Y available: According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the company will also launch a cheaper version with a range of 370km for $39,000. Musk said the Model Y will be “the safest midsize SUV by far” and believes that it will receive 5-star crash ratings thanks to its rigid body, low centre of gravity, and substantial crumple zones. It will also feature a 15-inch touchscreen display, as well as over-the-air software update capabilities to introduce new features as they are developed.
