The iStore has released pricing for Apple’s new iMac. Apple said the new iMac can be fitted with an 8-core Intel 9th-generation CPU and Radeon Vega graphics – giving it a “2x performance boost” – but this configuration was not listed by the iStore at the time of writing. “Customers are going to love the huge boost in iMac performance. With up to 8-core processors and powerful Vega graphics, the iMac line-up is stronger than ever,” said Apple at the launch of the new PCs. The iMac is available in 21.5-inch and 27-inch models, with the bigger unit packing a Retina 5K screen with a 5,120 x 2,880 resolution, added the company. South Africans will have the option of a 21.5-inch or 27-inch model, with various hardware configurations. The table below details the pricing of the new iMac models available in South Africa from the iStore.
