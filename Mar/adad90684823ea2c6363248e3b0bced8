EOH announced to shareholders that it is rescheduling the release of its interim financial results for the six-month period ended 31 January 2019. The delay will allow the group’s new financial director, Megan Pydigadu, to complete a financial review arising from the changes to the group’s strategic direction, EOH said. This review will encompass assets and projects across EOH’s business and geographic portfolio, and Pydigadu is engaging with the company’s auditor on the matter. “Review of the statement of financial position is an integral part of the strategic process, as mentioned in the CEO 100-day update on 11 December 2018, to ensure that the investments in various tangible and intangible assets are appropriately valued and the new IFRS standards applicable for FY19 are appropriately applied,” EOH said. The release of EOH’s interim results and presentation has accordingly been rescheduled from 26 March 2019 to 16 April 2019. EOH shares were down over 4% at the time of writing.
