Google has released the first Android 10 beta to developers, allowing users who sign up for the beta programme to download and install the OS. This initial version of the beta is currently only available for Google’s Pixel smartphones, including the first-generation Pixel devices. While this release is available for any user with a Pixel device, it is meant for developers to test compatibility issues and iron out bugs in the new operating system. Android 10 includes a number of new features with a focus on privacy, including the option to limit location information and files access by applications when they are not in use. The operating system will also include enhanced support for foldable smartphones such as Samsung’s Galaxy Fold and Huawei’s Mate X devices.
