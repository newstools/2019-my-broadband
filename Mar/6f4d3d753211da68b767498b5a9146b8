Disney’s upcoming streaming service is set to launch later this year and will include the company’s entire movie library, Polygon reports. The platform will be named Disney Plus. This selection of films will include movies from almost 100 years ago, including the original versions of Dumbo and Snow White. “The service, which I mentioned earlier is going to launch later in the year, is going to combine what we call library product, movies, and television, with a lot of original product as well, movies and television,” Disney said. “And at some point fairly soon after launch it will house the entire Disney motion picture library, so the movies that you speak of that traditionally have been kept in a ‘vault’ and brought out basically every few years will be on the service.” A number of new movies and shows are set to launch exclusively on the streaming platform, including a live-action Star Wars series titled The Mandalorian.
