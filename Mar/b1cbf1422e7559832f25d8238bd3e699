MTN has launched an auto-renew bundle option, allowing customers to automatically renew their data bundle once it is used up or expired. Once a data bundle expires, customers’ accounts will automatically be reloaded with another data bundle of the same size and validity. This will be charged from their prepaid airtime balance, or their contract usage limits. To use this feature, customers must select the auto-renew option when purchasing their bundle. MTN also announced that it has designed user-friendly triggers that will provide customers with warnings and recommendations. For example, a network issued USSD trigger will notify customers who have opted out of OOB usage, but have sufficient funds available, to purchase a bundle. The move is aimed at ensuring MTN complies with ICASA’s new end-user regulations, which kicked in today.
