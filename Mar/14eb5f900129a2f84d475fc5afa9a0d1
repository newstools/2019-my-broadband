The Galaxy S10 has launched – and the reviews for the new smartphone are in. This is what the international reviewers had to say. Wired touts the full-screen design of the display, as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, as great. It also highlights the additional features, including the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, wireless charging, and power sharing as nice inclusions. Criticisms include the Bixby button and slow wireless power sharing, but overall Wired rates the smartphone highly. Gizmodo was impressed with the Galaxy S10’s hardware, including the “stunning” display, triple-lens rear camera, and “gorgeous” design. They also highlight that the Galaxy S10 offers users a lot of battery life. Their biggest critique is that it is pricey, and that there are a few cases where ease of use could be improved. According to GSMArena, “the S10 is the superb phone we could have predicted it was going to be”. “Years of refinement have brought us to a place where groundbreaking changes are unlikely, but as incremental upgrades go, this is one of the more meaningful ones.” Key to the success of this smartphone is its “standout design,” strong build, high-quality display, and great photo and video qualities. According to TechRadar, the Galaxy S10 is “a fitting 10th anniversary phone for Samsung and its storied S series”. Pros includes a high screen-to-body ratio, the in-screen fingerprint sensor, and wireless PowerShare. However, TechRadar complains that the price hike is “stunning,” while lamenting the existence of the Bixby button.
