The developers at LineageOS have released a new version of the software – LineageOS 16.0 – which brings Android 9.0 to smartphones which no longer receive official updates. LineageOS is a custom ROM for Android devices which is an unofficial version of Android operating systems. This means that if your device is stuck on an older version of Google’s operating system and is compatible with LineageOS 16.0, you can install the software to upgrade your operating system to Android 9.0. Devices which feature support for LineageOS 16.0 include the Google Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy S5, Sony Xperia XA2, and the OnePlus One. LineageOS developers said that support for additional devices would be rolled out soon. “Additional devices will begin receiving builds as they are ready after we make minor changes to our build scripts to better handle the unique features, and resulting complications, of the most modern devices,” the team said. Users can download the latest version of LineageOS for their smartphone from the project’s download portal.
