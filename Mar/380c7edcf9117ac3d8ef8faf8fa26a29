If there’s one thing all techies love it is a good deal. Whether it is a R50 Takealot voucher or a discount on a domain registration fee, getting good value for money is always welcomed. The same mentality applies to fibre prices and ISPs know this – staggering their pricing in such a way that “just a little bit more money” can get you from a 20Mbps line to a 50Mbps package. How much you are willing to pay will be influenced by your budget, however, and you will eventually reach a point where a “good deal” is just too expensive. Going above your budget does have its benefits, though, and taking a small hit financially when it comes to fibre packages can give you exponential speed improvements. To show you just how much more value for money you get on faster fibre packages compared to slower – and cheaper – alternatives, we have listed the per-Mbps pricing of uncapped fibre accounts from Cool Ideas and Supersonic below. The pricing is based on the packages available on Openserve and Vumatel infrastructure, and is calculated using the formula of Price/Download Speed. The table below details the results of the comparison.
