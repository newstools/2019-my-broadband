Huawei has unveiled its new P30 smartphones at an event in Paris, with the line-up including a P30 Lite device. The P30 Lite is the next iteration of the popular mid-range P Lite series. This device is especially popular in South Africa, with the P20 Lite dominating its pricing sector in the local market since launch. The new smartphone will offer a 32MP selfie camera and ultra-wide triple-camera system at a very attractive price point. The P30 Lite also packs a Kirin 710 processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, and features an IPS LCD display instead of the OLED panels included on the high-end P30 and P30 Pro. Huawei has also opted to included a capacitive fingerprint sensor on the back of the P30 Lite smartphone instead of an in-screen fingerprint sensor like the one on the premium models. The device still sports a similar physical design to the flagship models however, along with various flagship features: such as a bezel-less display and tiny notch at the top of the screen. Like its premium counterparts, the P30 Lite includes a triple-camera system equipped with 24MP, 8MP, and 2MP lenses. At the time of writing, local pricing for the P30 Lite listed online was R5,699. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300608" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Lite-1.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 Lite 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Lite-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Lite-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-Lite-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Jamie McKane is reporting from Paris as a guest of Huawei.
