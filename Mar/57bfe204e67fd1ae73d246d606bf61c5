Reed Exhibitions Africa and ReedPOP have announced that Cape Town will play host to its own version of Comic Con in 2020. “With the unprecedented success of the 2018 Comic Con Africa, it is the natural next step to bring this format to the city of Cape Town,” said managing director of Reed Exhibitions, Carol Weaving. Comic Con Cape Town will have a stronger focus on films and series, as it has formed a strategic partnership with the Cape Town International Animation Festival. “We are proud of this association and hope to be able to grow both the Cape Town Animation Festival and Comic Con Cape Town through this partnership,” said Weaving. “While the style of this Comic Con will be slightly different to Comic Con Africa, we still expect the same level of entertainment focusing on our key pillars which include film, series, animation, cosplay, comic books, and gaming.” Comic Con Cape Town will take place from 1-3 May 2020, and the talent line-up will include both local and international celebrities in the film and TV industry.
