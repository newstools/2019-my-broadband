Businesses become more sophisticated thanks to innovation. However, many still use legacy security solutions, causing them to miss more attacks than they are blocking. According to a Kaspersky Lab survey, another reason why many CISOs feel pressured when it comes to cyber security is because of the complexity of their IT infrastructure. Complexity widens the attack surface – it complicates every aspect of protecting the infrastructure, as it requires specific cybersecurity measures. What’s more is that every company’s IT infrastructure is uniquely complex. As a result, IT security providers have seen an upsurge in demand for specialised cybersecurity solutions and services that will address each business’ specific needs This includes specialisations in hybrid cloud security, defense from targeted attacks and industrial network protection. To address these needs, Kaspersky Lab has launched a new global partner programme called Kaspersky United – an initiative to further equip channel partners with a framework to tackle the rapidly growing enterprise business, and to compete successfully in the agile cyber security market, which is exclusively brought to you by First Distribution – Africa’s leading cloud distributor. Through the Kaspersky United programme, Kaspersky Lab enables resellers to focus on selling the Kaspersky Lab services and products that match their own specialisations. Within the programme, resellers will also get comprehensive support and privileges from Kaspersky Lab, which include: Through the Kaspersky United programme, resellers can maintain and monetise their specialisations across four different status levels in one or several domains: by solution, such as hybrid cloud security, threat management and defense, or fraud prevention; or services, such as managed service providers, managed detection and response provider; or authorised training center. By offering certification in different skills or techniques, Kaspersky United helps resellers drive sales, as it demonstrates to their customers that they are experts in their areas of need.  <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-298786" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kaspersky-United-640x361.png" alt="Kaspersky United" width="640" height="361" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kaspersky-United-640x361.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kaspersky-United-600x339.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kaspersky-United-768x434.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kaspersky-United-1200x678.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “The channel is being transformed to meet customers’ expectations, with new service offerings and business models emerging,” said Ivan Bulaev, Head of Global Corporate Channel at Kaspersky Lab. “More and more small and medium customers are also moving to an IT outsourcing model and MSP business growth following this pattern.
