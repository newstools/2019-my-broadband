Google has begun rolling out the latest update to its browser – Chrome 73. The latest update ships with various new features, including: Chrome’s support for multimedia keys will finally allow users to control audio and video content playing within Chrome with dedicated keys on their keyboards. However, this tool does not work at a tab level – instead, pressing play or pause will control media across all tabs. Dark mode for macOS will cause Chrome to automatically implement the visual change when macOS is running its operating system-level dark mode. Windows support for Chrome’s dark mode will arrive at a later date. PWAs, meanwhile, “provide an installable, app-like experience, built and delivered directly via the web”. While this feature was already available on other desktop platforms, Google has added support for macOS, ensuring that all major operating systems now support the technology. Finally, signed HTTP exchanges enable “faster content delivery for users”, providing the benefits of a CDN without having to compromise the security of your certificate’s private key.
