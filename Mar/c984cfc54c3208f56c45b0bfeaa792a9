Many South African ICT professionals and executives are leaving the country, and the main reasons behind their decisions are affirmative action, BEE, and crime. This emerged from interviews which MyBroadband conducted with high-level ICT executives who left South Africa for Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The executives who were interviewed were guaranteed anonymity to give them the freedom to discuss the real reasons behind their decisions. DRA Group ICT Executive Martin Coetsee, who provided detailed information about his decision and his new life in Australia, said he was happy to be mentioned in an article. Coetsee also shared his views on what South Africa and local companies can do to retain IT executives. His answers provide valuable insight into the exodus of IT skills from South Africa, and how this can be addressed. Coetsee said there are five reasons which influenced his decision to leave South Africa. Coetsee said the decision to leave South Africa was unrelated to his employer. “As it now turns out, I am still with the same global company, DRA Global, but based in Perth, Australia,” he said. Coetsee said his professional life is much better in Australia than in South Africa for the reasons below. Coetsee did, however, highlight that Australia is expensive and service providers are not shy to charge. Coetsee said South African organisations that want to ensure they hang on to IT executives and specialists should play an active role in dealing with the challenges in the country.
