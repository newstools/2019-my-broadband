Huawei is expected to launch its next generation of flagship smartphones – the P30 – at an event in Paris next week. Information about the new smartphones has been appearing online ahead of the expected launch, including the camera specifications and design renders for the P30 and P30 Pro. Leaker Evan Blass has now posted images of the new devices on Twitter, which showcase designs similar to earlier leaked renders. The leaks show that both smartphones will feature in-screen fingerprint sensors and teardrop-style notches for the front camera. Additionally, it looks like the Huawei P30 Pro will have an edge-to-edge curved bezel-less display, while the P30 will have a standard FullView display design. The images also point to a difference in the camera design between both devices, with the P30 Pro featuring a fourth camera lens while the P30 retains a triple-camera system.
