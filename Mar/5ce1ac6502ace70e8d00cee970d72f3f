Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, Ubisoft’s upcoming online shooter, is set to launch on 15 March with a 90GB download for PlayStation 4 users, according to its support page. Additionally, from 11 March, users will be asked to install a “Title Update 1.5”, which is about 2GB and addresses audio issues ahead of the game’s release. Xbox One and PC users will need to download around 50GB of game files at launch. Players who already have access to either the private or open beta versions of the game will still need to download the full game again, meaning that it is a good idea to delete the beta build to save space. These download sizes are applicable even if users have bought a physical copy of the game.
