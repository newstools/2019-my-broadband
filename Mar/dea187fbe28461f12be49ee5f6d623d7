Samsung Pay will soon be available to Investec and Discovery Bank customers, Samsung South Africa has announced. This follows FNB recently launching support for the Samsung Pay app, allowing clients with compatible devices to make payments at terminals across the country. Users who bank with Investec and Discovery Bank will receive support in the near future, although Samsung did not state exactly when the service would launch for these customers. The company said the addition of these banks’ customers will make Samsung Pay as ubiquitous as any other form of payment in South Africa. “We’re excited to offer this innovative technology to more South Africans and are confident that the nation will continue to embrace the convenience of Samsung Pay with great enthusiasm,” said Samsung South Africa integrated mobility director Justin Hume. “As a human-centred company, Samsung is pleased to introduce a product that defies barriers and makes everyday tasks like the grocery run so much easier.”
