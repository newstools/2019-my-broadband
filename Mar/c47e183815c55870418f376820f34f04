Dropbox has updated the support page on its website, which now states that users with free accounts have a three-device limit. As of March 2019, Dropbox users with the free Basic account can only connect up to three devices to their account. Previously, users were able to link an unlimited number of devices to the platform. Users with more than three devices linked to Dropbox will be able to keep their devices connected, but will not be able to link any more devices. Dropbox Plus and Professional users can link unlimited devices to the cloud storage service.
