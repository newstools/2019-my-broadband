Jaguar has launched its electric I-PACE in South Africa. The company said it is the first electric vehicle launched in South Africa “together with a rapid charging network to enable long-distance travel”. The company will also offer home charging solutions, so users can charge their vehicle at home. “Designed from the outset as an electric vehicle, the I-PACE offers bold aero-efficient design and interior space for five adults and luggage,” said Jaguar. It also includes all-wheel drive from twin Jaguar-designed motors, with a combined 294kW of power and 696Nm of torque. This produces acceleration from 0-100km/h in 4.8 seconds. In terms of its battery, Jaguar has fitted a 90kWh lithium-ion unit that delivers a range of 470km. An 8-year/160,000km battery warranty is included, and the car requires 2-year/34,000km service intervals. Local pricing is listed below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-298330 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Jaguar-I-PACE-SA-Caesium-Blue101-640x427.jpg" alt=""
