Vodacom has merged its Consumer Business Unit (CBU) and its Sales and Distribution divisions and appointed Jorge Mendes as their new head. The company said Nyimpini Mabunda resigned as chief officer for Vodacom’s Consumer Business Unit to pursue external interests with effect from 31 January 2019. “After his departure a decision was taken to merge CBU and Sales and Distribution into one division,” said Vodacom spokesperson Byron Kennedy. “With effect from 1 February 2019, Jorge Mendes was appointed as Chief Officer: CBU and will continue to report into Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub.” Jorge’s career with Vodacom has spanned over 20 years, and includes executive positions in the DRC, Tanzania, and Mozambique. Mendes was previously appointed as Vodacom’s chief officer for sales and distribution in May 2016, where he was responsible for seven regions in South Africa. “Under his leadership, Vodacom continues to grow market share in the regions and has led the introduction of the county model which ensured more focus in each town and city,” Kennedy said.
