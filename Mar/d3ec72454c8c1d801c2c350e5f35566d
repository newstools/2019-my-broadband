Uber is not criminally liable for one of its self-driving cars hitting and killing a pedestrian in Arizona in March 2018. Reuters reported that prosecutors said there was “no basis for criminal liability”. The backup driver in the car at the time, Rafaela Vasquez, however, should be “referred to police for additional investigation”, added the report. The accident took place when a woman carried her bicycle into the middle of a dark street the Uber – a Volvo XC90 – was travelling on. The vehicle was in autonomous mode, with Vasquez in the car as the human backup driver. “The accident was a blow to the entire autonomous vehicle industry and led other companies to temporarily halt their testing,” stated the report. It added that Vasquez could face charges of vehicular manslaughter. Uber declined to comment, concluded the report. A video of the incident is shown in the Tempe Police video below.
