If it weren’t for Telkom’s relatively poor average upload speeds in Cape Town, it would have overtaken Vodacom and relegated it to the third-best mobile network in the city. Recent drive tests conducted by MyBroadband across Cape Town showed that MTN has overtaken Vodacom as the best mobile network in the city. While Vodacom is still ahead of Telkom in terms of overall network quality, as measured by MyBroadband’s Network Quality Score, it is very close to being overtaken. Telkom achieved an average download speed of 30.1Mbps in Cape Town, while Vodacom’s average download speed was 23.8Mbps. Vodacom had slightly better average latency, and a much better average upload speed – nudging it ahead of Telkom in terms of overall network quality. Vodacom’s Network Quality Score was 7.2, while Telkom’s was 7.1 – as shown in the table below. It should be noted that fewer tests were conducted on Telkom’s network than on Vodacom’s. If a test device was not connected to a data network, no test was conducted. This suggests that Vodacom has better coverage in the area, where Telkom does not. Only Telkom’s network infrastructure was tested, and its roaming on Vodacom was not included as part of this test. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-296502 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cape-Town-Results-640x390.jpg" alt="Cape Town network drive testing results - February 2019" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cape-Town-Results-640x390.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cape-Town-Results-600x366.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cape-Town-Results-768x468.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cape-Town-Results.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Asked why its download speeds appear to be on the low side, and what it is doing to improve the performance of its network, Vodacom provided the following statement to MyBroadband. “When it comes to our network, Vodacom doesn’t just focus on throughput and latency, but takes the total customer experience into account. This includes great network performance, widest coverage range, choice, and service excellence,” Vodacom said. Vodacom said it continues to make significant investments in its regional networks to provide the best service possible and to cater for all types of handsets, not just the most modern smartphones with the latest features. “Vodacom has also entered into strategic network sharing agreements in the Western Cape to manage demand for data services in a spectrum-constrained environment,” it said. “We are confident that this strategy of sustained network investment and improvement will help us continue providing the best customer experience for all of our customers.”
