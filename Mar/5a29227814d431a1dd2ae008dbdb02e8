Gorilla Glass manufacturer Corning is developing a new version of its protective glass for foldable smartphones. Speaking in an interview with Wired, Corning Gorilla Glass lead John Bayne said the company is working on a solution for the foldable display problem. He said the biggest issue was balancing rigidity and structure with the tight bend radius required by a foldable design. “In a glass solution, you’re really challenging the laws of physics, in that to get a very tight bend radius you want to go thinner and thinner, but you also have to be able to survive a drop event and resist damage,” Bayne said. However, Corning is reportedly developing a 0.1mm-think bendable glass which can resist drops and cracks while keeping a 5mm bend radius. The company expects to roll out this technology in a couple of years, in time for the mainstream proliferation of foldable smartphones. In the meantime, early devices such as the Galaxy Fold and the Huawei Mate X will continue to rely on plastic displays to ensure their products hold up to continued folding motions.
