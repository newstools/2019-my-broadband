Internet Solutions has told MyBroadband it is working on its Consumer Virtual Machine environment following a “hard disc failure”. Several Internet Solutions clients contacted MyBroadband this week after experiencing a prolonged service outage. One reader said they have been experiencing issues for over a week, while another user said his company uses Internet Solutions for their cloud-based server – and their server has been down since 18 March 2019. Following questions from MyBroadband, Internet Solutions said it experienced “hard disc failures” in its Consumer Virtual Machine environment last week – resulting in certain clients having limited or no access to their services. “While every effort is being made to restore the environment to optimal operation, clients are currently being migrated to an alternative virtual machine environment to address their immediate service requirements,” said Internet Solutions. Internet Solutions told MyBroadband that its Consumer Virtual Machine environment remains in the restoration process, but “this is taking longer than anticipated”. “However, we have provided alternative virtual machine services, in various configurations, whereby clients can restore their backups and settings in order to continue operating,” said the company. “We continue to work with our clients to assist them in the transition and encourage any clients who are experiencing difficulties with the Consumer Virtual Machine environment to contact us as soon as possible on newvm@is.co.za.” Following the publication of the original article on the matter, several users told MyBroadband they were experiencing downtime on their services. One reader stated a client of his has seven business branches which use Internet Solutions’ cloud-based servers to host an SQL database, and that they are unable to access this database.
