Volvo has announced that it will limit the top speed of its vehicles to 180km/h in 2021. The Verge stated that the speed limit will be permanent and users will not be able to remove it. Volvo said the speed limit on all its 2021 vehicles is part of its Vision 2020 plan to reduce traffic fatalities. The limit will not apply to Volvo’s Polestar electric performance vehicles, however. A speed limit on cars is not unique, and German brands like BMW and Mercedes often limits their vehicles to a top speed of 250km/h – regardless of their power. The report further noted that Volvo’s 180km/h limit is well above the maximum speed limit in most countries.
