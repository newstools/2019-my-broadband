On the World Wide Web’s 30th anniversary, founder Tim Berners-Lee has released a blog post outlining how we should be tackling the issues the web has created. “Given how much the web has changed in the past 30 years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next 30 years,” said Berners-Lee. According to him, there are three main types of “dysfunction” on the web: According to Berners-Lee, we need to create laws and code that assists in minimising malicious behaviour. Systems need to be researched and redesigned so as to avoid the current perverse incentives that many encourage, he added. “As the web reshapes our world, we have a responsibility to make sure it is recognised as a human right and built for the public good,” said Berners-Lee. He added that to this end, the Web Foundation is working with governments, companies, and citizens to build a new Contract for the Web.
