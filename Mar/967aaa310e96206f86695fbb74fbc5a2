Apple has started the rollout of iOS 12.2 for iPhones and iPads. Included in the new version of iOS is the company’s News+ product, which allows users to subscribe to a variety of magazines and news publications. However, this feature is not yet available to South African users. Another new feature is the ability to control your Apple TV with an iPad or iPhone. For this feature to work, users must update their Apple TV to tvOS 12.2. This update will also be the first to support Apple’s recently-announced second-generation AirPods, and includes a variety of bug fixes and minor improvements. The rollout follows Apple announcing a variety of new products last night, including its Netflix competitor Apple TV+ and a new credit card that does not charge users banking fees.
