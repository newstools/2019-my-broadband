Apple is set to unveil its streaming service today, which many have speculated will offer free original content to Apple device users. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, however, the content will not be available free of charge. Apple is set to offer the HBO, Showtime, and Starz channels for $9.99 per month each, while its news service will also cost $9.99. Its original content – set to take on Netflix directly – will also be charged for, but no pricing was detailed. The report added that Netflix will not be a part of Apple’s service, while plans to include Disney fell through after the company unveiled its own streaming service.
