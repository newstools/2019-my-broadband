Microsoft is working on bringing its Windows Defender antivirus software to Apple’s desktop operating system. The company announced that its Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) software will be available for non-Windows customers as a unified software offering. The Microsoft Defender ATP client can be installed on devices running macOS Mojave, macOS High Sierra, or macOS Sierra, and is currently available as a limited preview. Microsoft said the interface of its Mac client would be similar to the Windows Defender software currently running on Windows 10 devices. “We’ve been working closely with industry partners to enable Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection customers to protect their non-Windows devices while keeping a centralized single pane of glass experience,” the company stated. Microsoft Defender ATP will offer Mac users virus and threat protection, automatic threat investigation, endpoint detection and response, and vulnerability management. Customers can apply for a preview version of the client, and Microsoft will contact customers via email to confirm their participation.
