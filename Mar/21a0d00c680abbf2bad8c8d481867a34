Xiaomi has shared a video that shows a quick-charging system charging a Xiaomi smartphone to 100% in just 17 minutes. In the video, two phones are charged next to each other: a “Xiaomi 100W charging while switched on 4,000mAh” and “Brand O 50W charging while switched off 3,700mAh”. The Xiaomi smartphone reaches 100% battery charge after 17 minutes, at which point the other smartphone – which appears to be an Oppo device – has only charged to 65%. While the Xiaomi’s maximum charging capacity is said to be 100W, in reality it reaches a maximum wattage of 88W. In comparison, the “Brand O” smartphone reaches a maximum wattage of 40W. Currently, the charging system is only a demo.
