SEACOM announced that it has completed the 100% acquisition of FibreCo Telecommunications. “FibreCo owns and operates a national fibre network providing infrastructure and connectivity services across South Africa. The acquisition was made through SEACOM’s affiliate SEACOM South Africa,” said the company. With the acquisition of FibreCo, SEACOM completes its “African Ring” by connecting its East and West coast submarine assets, it added. SEACOM CEO Byron Clatterbuck said the acquisition “reaffirms SEACOM as the provider of choice to local and international data communications customers by expanding its wholesale portfolio to include dark-fibre infrastructure services in the metro and long-distance marketplace”. “We also plan to light-up the FibreCo national infrastructure, enabling SEACOM to deliver affordable, high-speed Internet connectivity and cloud services to bandwidth-starved cities and towns along our new fibre routes.”
