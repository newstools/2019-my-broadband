Microsoft has announced that its Windows Calculator has gone open source. Windows Calculator is now on GitHub under the MIT Licence, said the company. “This includes the source code, build system, unit tests, and product roadmap. Our goal is to build an even better user experience in partnership with the community. We are encouraging your fresh perspectives and increased participation to help define the future of Calculator,” it said. The company added that the Calculator will “continue to go through all usual testing, compliance, security, and quality processes”, but users will now be able to learn more about how it works and integrate Calculator logic or UI into their own applications. “Anyone can participate in the development of Windows Calculator. Getting involved is simple. The project is ‘clone-and-go’ and development will follow the standard GitHub flow.”
