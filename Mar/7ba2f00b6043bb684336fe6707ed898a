South Africa’s ministers are crucial to the functioning of the country, but their competency is often called into question. Besides their performance and that of their departments, a measure of a minister’s ability is often linked to their education achievements. This point is often raised when looking at the poor performance of South Africa under former President Jacob Zuma, which was attributed in part to his lack of formal education. MyBroadband previously looked into the qualifications of South Africa’s top political party leaders and found there were various qualifications among them – ranging from a doctorate to a matric certificate. ANC leader and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa has a BProc degree, while his strongest rivals Mmusi Maimane and Julius Malema boast Master’s and Honours degrees respectively. MyBroadband has now taken this investigation a step further by looking into the qualifications of of South Africa’s current ministers. Again, the qualifications of these politicians range from doctorates to matric certificates – but on the whole, South Africa’s ministers seem to be fairly well qualified. South Africa’s ministers and their qualifications are detailed below.
