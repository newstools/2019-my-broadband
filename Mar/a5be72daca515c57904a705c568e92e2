Electronic Arts (EA) is set to lay off 350 staff, according to a report by Kotaku. In an email seen by Kotaku, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said the publisher is implementing the staff cuts to “streamline decision-making in the marketing and publishing departments”. “These are important but very hard decisions, and we do not take them lightly,” said EA in a statement. “We are friends and colleagues at EA, we appreciate and value everyone’s contributions, and we are doing everything we can to ensure we are looking after our people to help them through this period to find their next opportunity. This is our top priority.” According to a member of an affected department, the cuts had been expected after EA placed hiring and travel restrictions on its marketing department. EA’s decision follows a similar one by Activision Blizzard in February, when the company announced plans to cut 8% of its workforce after a poor sales forecast.
