Takealot’s Daily Deals are well known, both for the right and wrong reasons. While the online retailer offers a wide range of goods at discounted prices on a daily basis, the Daily Deals pricing has been called into question in the past. In June 2018, the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) ruled that a Takealot Daily Deals list price for a Samsung TV was misleading. Takealot advertised the Samsung 55-inch 4K TV for R15,999 – a discount of 40% on its R26,000 list price – as part of its Daily Deals. A consumer then lodged a complaint with the ASA, stating that the “normal price prior to this promotion was R18,225”. The ASA ruled that the highest prices of similar televisions was between R19,000 and R20,000, and the list price of the model in question was no longer available. It subsequently found that Takealot’s advertising was misleading, due to the R26,000 list price claim. While discounting a product from a high list price may get shoppers hot under the collar, many agree that the actual selling price being cheaper than competing stores is the most important aspect of a deal. To see how Takealot’s Daily Deals compare against other online retailers, in terms of the actual prices on offer, we looked at the selling price of items listed on the site on 12 March 2019. Five tech items listed in Takealot’s Daily Deals were selected and their prices compared against those offered by competing online retailers – including Makro, Raru, Loot, Rebel Tech, Wootware, Incredible Connection, and HiFi Corp. The results of the comparison are shown below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299030" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dell-Monitor.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dell-Monitor.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dell-Monitor-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dell-Monitor-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299036" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JVC-TV.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JVC-TV.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JVC-TV-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JVC-TV-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299032" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HDD.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HDD.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HDD-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HDD-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299038" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PS4.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PS4.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PS4-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PS4-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299034" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
