Also included in the Care+ package are free pick-up and drop-off services, and access to Samsung’s 24-hour call centre. Access to these benefits will span two years, and is also available on Samsung’s Galaxy S8, S9, Note 8, and Note 9. Customers who pre-ordered their Galaxy S10 smartphone before 17 March have up until 17 April to take advantage of the Care+ offer. A special deal is also available to those who purchase their Galaxy S10 through Dion Wired. These customers will received Care+ for free, and will only have to pay a nominal fee towards screen repair costs if needed. “This is undeniably a phone worth protecting, which is why S10 users will appreciate the peace of mind of Samsung Care+,” said Samsung.
