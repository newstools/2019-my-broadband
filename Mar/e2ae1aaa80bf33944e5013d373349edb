The Bloodhound land speed record (LSR) team has announced that it is back on the trail of a world land speed record. This comes after Grafton LSR CEO Ian Warhurst acquired the project and assembled a new Bloodhound LSR team, with a focus on completing the Bloodhound vehicle. Warhurst and his team will rebrand the project, including a visual transformation of the car, which is now red and white. Development of the Bloodhound vehicle will take place at SGS Berkley Green University Technical College in Gloucestershire. “Since buying Bloodhound from the administrators last December, the team and I have been overwhelmed by the passion and enthusiasm the public have shown for the project,” said Warhurst. “Over the last decade, an incredible amount of hard graft has been invested in the project and it would be a tragedy to see it go to waste.”
