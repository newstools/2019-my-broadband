Mozilla has released a new version of Firefox designed specifically for use on iPads. Included in this version of Firefox is a split screen function that allows users to place two apps side-by-side. It will also include a new tab management interface that displays tabs in a tiled format. Other new features include the ability to set Firefox as the default browser for opening links, macOS keyboard shortcuts, and a send tabs feature that lets you send tabs between your devices. “We know that iPads aren’t just bigger versions of iPhones. So rather than just make a bigger version of our browser for iOS, we made Firefox for iPad look and feel like it was custom made for a tablet,” said Mozilla. Apple also recently launched two new iPads – a new iPad Air and a new iPad Mini.
