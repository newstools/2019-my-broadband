Huawei has begun offering commercial cloud services in South Africa, making it the world’s first cloud provider with an operational data centre on the continent. The South African Huawei Cloud facility complies with Tier 3+ standards and uses Huawei’s high-performance chips and network devices. The Huawei Cloud data centre is located in Johannesburg and is being leased from a local partner, the company said. Huawei Cloud Business Unit vice president Edward Deng said South Africa was one of the most diverse and promising emerging markets globally. “We are looking forward to Huawei Cloud’s innovative technologies and services, such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence assisting African governments, carriers, and enterprises in a variety of industries such as finance, energy, agriculture, to leapfrog to a fully-connected, intelligent era,” Deng said. Huawei said it plans to gradually open more data centres in Kenya, Nigeria, and other African countries to provide localised services.
