Oculus has revealed its next-generation VR headset, the Rift S. The Rift S offers PC gamers a higher resolution gaming experience thanks to improved optics and display technology. It was designed in partnership with Lenovo with a focus on comfort and superior weight distribution, while the new VR headset will also provide users with a headphone jack â€“ allowing them to utilise their own headphones. It will also feature Oculus Insight: a technology that uses computer vision algorithms to monitor and navigate the physical area around the gamer in real time. The Rift S will use the same core platform as the original Rift, meaning that regardless of the Rift you use, you will have access to the same software updates and games. The Oculus Rift S is set to release in the second quarter of 2019 and will cost $399. South African pricing is not yet available.
