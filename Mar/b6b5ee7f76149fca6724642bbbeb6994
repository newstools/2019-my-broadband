The Focus Plus will cost $799 in the US, with South African pricing yet to be announced. The Vive Plus is a business-focused VR headset and is positioned differently to the recently-announced Oculus Quest. One of the more notable features is that it offers significantly improved tracking options when compared to the Vive Focus. It will run off a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and will offer 1,440 x 1,600 pixels for each eye – a resolution in line with its competitors. The Focus Plus will ship with two controllers and uses internal cameras for tracking purposes, meaning there will be no wires or external cameras to worry about. The Vive Focus Plus will launch in 25 markets and support as many as 19 languages.
