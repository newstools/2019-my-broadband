There were three nuclear waste leaks at the Koeberg nuclear power station in 2014 and 2015, but the radiation levels were not high enough to inform the public about the leaks. This emerged from answers in parliament by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe posed to him by the Freedom Front Plus’ Corne Mulder. Eskom has now provided further details about the leaks to address speculation about security problems at the nuclear power station. The power utility said in a press statement on 31 March that both power generation units at Koeberg are running safely and are adding 1,960MW into the power grid. Koeberg general manager Velaphi Ntuli provided further details about the nuclear waste leaks. “In all these events the radiation activity levels were determined to be very low and well within the regulatory requirements,” said Ntuli. “These incidents, while negligible, were duly reported to the National Nuclear Regulation (NNR), in line with the licence requirements.” Ntuli added that Eskom’s nuclear oversight committee conducted a thorough investigation to understand the impact of the three events even though these were below regulatory levels. “The committee found that there was no risk to members of the public, staff, or the environment. South Africans can rest assured that there are no radioactive waste leaks at Koeberg,” said Ntuli. He explained that the Koeberg power station hosts quarterly Public Information Safety Forum (PSIF) meetings where members of the public are given detailed feedback about the station’s safety and performance. “We invite those interested in learning about nuclear safety and how a nuclear power plant is run to attend these sessions, schedule a visit to our visitors centre or browse the Eskom website to get facts around nuclear,” said Ntuli.
