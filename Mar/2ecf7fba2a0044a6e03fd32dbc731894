One of the major downsides to the current electricity crisis in South Africa is the loss of a fixed Internet connection. There are ways to mitigate this problem however, and one of them is to purchase a fixed-LTE broadband package to continue browsing when the lights go out. These packages are available from all major operators except Rain, which discontinued its fixed-LTE product last year. To see how they compare, we looked at the fixed-LTE products available directly from local operators Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom. For the comparison, fixed-LTE packages available from mobile operators, including SIM-only products, were considered. Cell C offers a number of LTE-A SIM-only deals on its website, with capped packages ranging from 15GB to 200GB in capacity. Vodacom offers two LTE-A deals directly to customers, bundled with a Huawei B618 router and AnyTime and Night Owl data. MTN’s Made for Me Home LTE-A offerings include a Huawei B612 router and include capped packages ranging from 15GB to 110GB in size. Telkom offers the widest selection of fixed-LTE deals to customers, with promotional data available on all capped products along with a separate uncapped package. It should be noted that the uncapped fixed-LTE package offered by Telkom comes with a strict fair-usage policy. The best fixed-LTE deals available directly from South African mobile operators are below.
