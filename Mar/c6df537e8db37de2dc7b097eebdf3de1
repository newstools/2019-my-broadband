Huawei has confirmed that its Mate X foldable smartphone will launch in South Africa this year. Speaking at an event in Johannesburg, Huawei South Africa general manager Likun Zhao said the Mate X would go on sale in either June or July. He added that South Africa would be part of the first wave of countries to receive the device. “We will focus on operator sales and discuss with them how to design the offer and package for premium customers,” Zhao said. The Huawei Mate X will be available in South Africa in one colour option – Interstellar Blue – and a full protection case will be available when the device ships. Huawei said that it will hopefully have more case options available by the time the device launches. There is currently no local pricing available for the Mate X, but it is expected to be priced at around €2,299 internationally. The Huawei Mate X’s design sees the back screen folding out of the smartphone towards the user. This means that the middle of the display panel acts as the hinge of the smartphone and allows the Mate X to lie flat when folded. Additionally, this means that the front panel acts as a fullscreen, bezel-less display, similar to modern smartphones when the device is folded. The design also equips the Mate X with a rear display next to main camera system, allowing users to take selfies with the main rear camera. The device features three displays: Huawei’s Mate X is powered by the HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset and includes the company’s Balong 5000 chip for 5G connectivity. The smartphone will have 8GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage, along with a Leica triple-camera system on the rear of the device.
