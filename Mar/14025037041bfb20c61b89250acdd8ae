The NBA and YouTube have announced the launch of the NBA’s first YouTube channel dedicated to fans in sub-Saharan Africa – NBA Africa. The channel will broadcast two live games per week for the rest of the 2018-19 season, including the playoffs, conference finals, and the finals. NBA Africa will also deliver content showcasing the history and growth of the sport, including a customised weekly magazine show and NBA documentaries. The first two live games on the channel will take place on 24 March and will feature the Charlotte Hornets playing the Boston Celtics, followed by the L.A. Clippers against the New York Knicks. “The NBA Africa YouTube channel is yet another important milestone for the NBA in Africa and will allow more fans to access our games, live and on-demand, across the continent,” said NBA MD for Africa Amadou Gallo Fall.
