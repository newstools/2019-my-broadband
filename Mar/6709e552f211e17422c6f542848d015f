BitCo, leading national Internet Service Provider (ISP) and official ISP to Cricket South Africa and the Proteas, has just announced that their uncapped Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) services are now available on the Openserve network. The company launched their FTTH offering, BitCo Home, in October 2018 which has since been available on the Vumatel Network. BitCo says that the demand they have received over the past several months has justified their move to partner with Openserve — said to be the largest FTTH infrastructure provider in South Africa. “We have received a tremendous response since launching BitCo Home. Partnering with Openserve enables us to make high-speed, reliable Internet available to more home users throughout the Metropolitan areas,” says CEO of BitCo Telecoms, Jarryd Chatz. Residential Internet users on the Openserve Network can choose between competitively priced uncapped, unshaped and full-speed (not throttled) Home Fibre with download and upload speeds as follows: BitCo Home services are offered on a month-to-month, 12 or 24-month options with 24/7 support and a free-to-use router.
