In response to a question in parliament by the DA, Minister of Communications Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has revealed that the SABC owes musicians over R248 million in royalties. The music organisations that are owed money include SAMRO and SAMPRA. “These are hard-working men and women whom the President has a responsibility towards. These working artists have families to feed, school fees to pay, and must keep a roof over their heads,” said DA shadow minister of communications, Phumzile van Damme. The SABC is also reportedly unable to pay salaries to its own employees, according to the DA. The public broadcaster was declared as insolvent at the end of January, and Ndabeni-Abrahams has since announced that National Treasury will provide the SABC with interim financial relief to prevent it from collapsing by the end of March. The royalties owed to local music organisations are listed below.
