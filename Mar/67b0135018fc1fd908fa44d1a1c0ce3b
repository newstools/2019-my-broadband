Liquid Telecom announced it has expanded the availability of Microsoft Azure across its network in Africa following the recent launch of Azure data centres in South Africa. The company said that thanks to the launch of Azure regions and the local Azure Stack deployments in its own data centres connected via Microsoft ExpressRoute, customers can access its hybrid cloud solution within the African continent. The launch of these new Azure cloud regions in South Africa will give businesses access to globally-available services with low latency and high local capacity, the company said. “We are delighted by the launch of Microsoft’s cloud regions in Africa, and by extending the reach of Microsoft Azure to an increasing number of countries and customers, Liquid Telecom is helping Africa realise its digital future,” said Nic Rudnick, Group CEO, Liquid Telecom. “Together, Microsoft and Liquid Telecom are creating a modern business foundation for customers in Africa – one that inspires innovation, cloud-paced change, compliance, and business growth.” Liquid Telecom’s Azure hybrid cloud services have been rolled out to five countries – South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, and Rwanda – with more regions scheduled to go live soon. “Liquid Telecom is a trusted partner of Microsoft with the breadth of their fibre network, data centre infrastructure, market reach, and expertise to enable customers to realise their business objectives more quickly and effectively,” said Azure South Africa business lead Dean Erasmus.
