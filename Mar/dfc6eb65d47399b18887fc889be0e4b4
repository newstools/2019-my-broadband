EOH has released a SENS update announcing that, due to the expiry of the 30-day notice period given to it by Microsoft, it is officially no longer a reseller of Microsoft software licences. “While we understand the need for Microsoft to interrogate and finalise their own investigations, we are disappointed at the unilateral manner in which Microsoft has terminated the relationship prior to giving consideration to the impact on South African corporates,” said EOH. According to EOH, the ramifications of the loss are likely to be: In total, EOH assesses that the combined impact equates to under R20 million for the current financial year. EOH also said that on 12 March, various EOH group companies received a 30-day notice period of Microsoft Ireland’s intention to terminate their Microsoft Partner Network Agreement with these companies. Microsoft Ireland did not provide EOH with any reasons for the termination. EOH highlighted that investigations are ongoing to determine any wrongdoing on the part of EOH, its customers, its partners, and its employees which led to the decision by Microsoft. EOH has also hired forensic accounting teams to investigate its public-sector contracts, following allegations of a corrupt contract between it and the SA Department of Defence. This allegation led to Microsoft cutting ties with EOH. “Employees implicated in wrongdoing have either been suspended or have resigned,” said EOH. The company has also implemented a new framework whereby all public-sector deals, as well as related partners, are reviewed, screened, and vetted by ENS Africa.
