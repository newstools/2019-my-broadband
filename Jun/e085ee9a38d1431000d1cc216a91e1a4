The 2019 MyBroadband Cloud Conference, hosted in partnership with Liquid Telecom, took place at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand on 6 June 2019. The annual event received a phenomenal response from South Africa’s top cloud, hosting, and security executives and IT professionals, hosting over 1,100 delegates from across South Africa and neighbouring countries. At the conference, Liquid Telecom showcased its Africa datacentres, which form part of Africa’s first and largest network of interconnected carrier and cloud neutral data centre facilities. According to Winston Ritson, Group Head of Cloud Services at Liquid Telecom, these are the physical datacentres across a few territories in Africa that will provide a home for the hyperscalers when they come into Africa. These datacentres also help home-grown companies leverage leading cloud providers, carriers, and enterprises. “Beyond the Africa datacentre, we are also looking at hyperscale cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and others. We’ve got a great relationship with them, and at this point we’re selling these services across all the territories we operate in,” said Ritson. Another product Liquid showcased at the event was their Azure Stack service, which they offer across Africa. Azure Stack is a miniaturised Azure service that runs on commodity hardware, and Liquid has these deployed in a few countries across the continent. Liquid Telecom’s CEO Reshaad Sha was also one of the speakers at the conference and outlined a simple three-step programme for migrating business workloads to the cloud. Liquid Telecom is a Pan-African telecoms provider and brings global skills to local markets. They are your trusted partner for rapid and secure data centre services and interconnections across the African continent. Photos of Liquid Telecom’s presence at the conference are posted below.
