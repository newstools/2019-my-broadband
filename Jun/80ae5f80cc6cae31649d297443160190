EOH has appointed Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi as chairman of its board with immediate effect. “I am excited to be joining a company at the forefront of technology and job creation in South Africa,” said Mkhwanazi. “EOH is at the heart of the country’s future growth prospects. I am impressed by the way new management is tackling legacy issues and also by their clear vision for our future.” Mkhwanazi served as chairman of BHP Billiton in South Africa from 2008 to 2015, and has also previously served as CEO of Bateman Africa and the National Electricity Regulator, which became NERSA in 2004. “We are very pleased with the appointment of Dr Mkhwanazi to the Board,” said EOH CEO Stephen van Coller. “His track record of providing courageous leadership in challenging business environments, coupled with his commitment to sound corporate governance, were key drivers for his appointment.” Mkhwanazi will lead the board on the findings of the investigation commissioned by EOH into controversial public sector contracts, which saw Microsoft pull out of its partnership with the company. “Relevant findings and associated actions will be disclosed as soon as practically possible after the next steps have been agreed by the board,” said EOH.
