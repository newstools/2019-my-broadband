Microsoft has released new security updates for Windows 10 to address a security flaw related to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. The company revealed in an advisory that it has disabled the pairing of some BLE devices due to a security vulnerability related to FIDO two-factor authentication keys. “Microsoft is aware of an issue that affects the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) version of FIDO Security Keys,” the company said. “Due to a misconfiguration in the Bluetooth pairing protocols, it is possible for an attacker who is physically close to a user at the moment he/she uses the security key to communicate with the security key, or communicate with the device to which the key is paired.” This vulnerability allows attackers to intercept pairing codes and connect to the target device via Bluetooth without authorisation. Microsoft said it recommended customers install the latest June security updates for Windows 10, although this may affect the functionality of some BLE devices.
