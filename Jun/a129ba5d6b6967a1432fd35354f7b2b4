Samsung has filed a patent with the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO) for a rollable smartphone, Gizmodo reported. According to the patent, the smartphone would look like a traditional smartphone at first glance, but its display would be capable of extending by as much as 60% through a sliding mechanism. The technology seems to use an extreme version of a technique already used by smartphone makers to reduce the bottom bezel of devices â€“ which is achieved by bending the display inwards. If rollable smartphone technology does become mainstream, it could be used to reduce the form factor of smartphones. There is no guarantee that Samsung will actually create a rollable smartphone, and given the issues the company is having with its foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Fold, any Samsung rollable products seem a long way off.
