The SABC has confirmed that it will not be broadcasting any more live Cricket World Cup matches. The national broadcaster outlined its remaining schedule for the event in a tweet, which shows that South Africa’s remaining matches will be split between delayed TV broadcasts and radio-only coverage. SuperSport and the SABC previously announced an agreement to let the national broadcaster show certain Cricket World Cup matches after what both parties described as “extensive negotiations”. As part of the deal, the broadcasting of matches on the SABC would vary between live matches, delayed matches, and highlights packages. All Proteas matches are available live to SuperSport subscribers – regardless of which package they’re subscribed to. The SABC broadcast schedule for the remainder of the Cricket World Cup is shown below.
