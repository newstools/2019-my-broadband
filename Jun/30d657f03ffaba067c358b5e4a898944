Netflix has begun testing a new discovery feed which displays trailers, photos, and other media in a manner similar to Instagram, Variety reports. The feed is named Extras and is being rolled out to the Netflix mobile app for a small portion of Netflix’s audience, the company confirmed. “We are testing a feed of video extras in our mobile app to help fans connect more deeply with the titles they love and discover new ones to watch,” Netflix told Variety. “These tests typically vary in length of time and by region, and may not become permanent.” Extras allows users to share trailers and show alerts through third-party applications, as well as prompting users to share when they add shows to their list. Users can access the Extras feed through a dedicated button at the bottom of the mobile app. Netflix did not state when this feature would roll out to the rest of its users.
