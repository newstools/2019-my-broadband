SuperSport has launched an Olympic Channel section on its official website, offering Olympics-related content from across the world. In addition to locally-produced features created by SuperSport, viewers will be able to watch Olympic-themed original series and documentaries commissioned by the global Olympic Channel. Fans will be able to access news stories in the lead up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, and the channel also includes original content surrounding South African athletes. “With Tokyo 2020 just over a year away, we look forward to further developing our partnership with SuperSport across multiple platforms with the common goal of building excitement for the upcoming Olympic Games through relevant and local content that engages their audience,” said IOC’s global Olympic Channel general manager Mark Parkman. SuperSport has a media rights agreement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games through 2024, which also includes the launch of a 24/7 linear Olympic channel prior to Tokyo 2020. “The countdown has begun in earnest for the 2020 Olympic Games and SuperSport is determined to bring the many stories and the vibrant build-up to viewers across the African continent,” said SuperSport chief executive Gideon Khobane. “Our partnership with the IOC is something we cherish and we look forward to building towards the action in Tokyo, where Africa will be well represented.” SuperSport’s media rights agreement includes distribution in 45 territories across Sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa.
