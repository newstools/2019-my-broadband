Research by NPD shows that the Nintendo Switch is the most-purchased console in 2019, beating competitors such as Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One. The Switch was also the most popular console in May 2019, although total hardware sales last month were 20% down when compared with May 2018. Mortal Kombat 11 was the best-selling video game of May 2019 across all consoles, repeating its performance from the previous month, and it is also the best selling game of 2019. It was the most popular game on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and featured 5th on the Switch – making it the only non-Nintendo game to appear in the top 10 on the platform. Other popular games which still feature in the May top 10 despite being launched before 2019 include Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption II, and Minecraft. Video game sales took a dive in May, dropping 13% year-on-year to $262 million, but year-to-date game sales for 2019 remain slightly higher than at the same point last year. The top 10 games of May 2019 across all platforms are listed below.
