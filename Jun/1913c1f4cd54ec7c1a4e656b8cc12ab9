Google will make its AMP-powered dynamic email service available to all Gmail users on 2 July. The service, which is currently available in a beta version to G Suite customers, uses the accelerated mobile pages (AMP) framework to load web pages within the Gmail application. The new feature will bring improved functionality to Gmail users, including the ability to fill out forms, respond to events, reply to Google Docs edits, and browse images. To enable or disable the feature, users will need to click on the settings cog and choose the Settings option before toggling “Enable dynamic email” on or off. The feature will only be available for the web version of Gmail, although Google said that support for mobile devices is coming soon.
