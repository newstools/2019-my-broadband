Moving to the cloud is often viewed as a challenging and complex process, but it should be seen as simple upgrade, according to Oracle Solution Engineering Director Ocea Garriock. Speaking at the 2019 MyBroadband Cloud Conference, Garriock said that Oracle has seen impressive growth in the number of customers migrating to the cloud. “We have seen a major uptake of cloud in recent times,” Garriock said. “We have a full application for our SaaS solutions, and we have 2,500 clients that have already embraced those solutions in the cloud.” “Embedded into these applications are cutting-edge technologies such as AI, blockchain, and IoT.” Garriock added that the security is also superior in a cloud environment due to the quick patching of vulnerabilities. “Most breaches occur where the patch is already available but it hasn’t been applied yet,” Garriock said. “Cloud environments remove this threat by updating as quickly as possible.” Garriock said that Oracle aims to make migrating services to the cloud as easy as a standard upgrade. “We want to make it as simple as an upgrade to move to the cloud,” she said. “Everybody has a roadmap, but we want to make it as simple as possible. It is the last upgrade you will have to do.” “Moving to cloud reduces costs and risks, moves your people from administration to innovation, increases productivity, and gives you new ways to deliver services and experiences to clients,” she said. Oracle offers a range of migration options to its customers, including the public cloud, on-premise solutions, and cloud-at-customer. The cloud-at-customer solution allows clients which want to control the location of their data the ability to run a cloud solution using an on-premise environment provided and managed by Oracle.
