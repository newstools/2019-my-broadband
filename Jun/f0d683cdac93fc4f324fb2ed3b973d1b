MTN has launched an artificial intelligence chatbot service for its Mobile Money (MoMo) platform. The chatbot launched in Ivory Coast in May and will be rolled out across MTN’s MoMo footprint in the next few months. This AI assistant helps customers to facilitate payments and engage with MoMo services on social media and via SMS. MTN said the chatbot would also be included in its own newly-released instant messaging service, named “Ayoba”. “We are passionate about bringing the power of our mobile money solutions to more than 60 million customers across Africa over the next few years,” said MTN Group CEO Rob Shuter. “Harnessing modern technologies like artificial intelligence can improve in scale, how MTN interacts with customers, enabling them to reach us anytime and anywhere, through a variety of channels including social networks and messaging applications.”
