WhatsApp has begun rolling out its new Share to Facebook feature for the beta version of its mobile app, The Verge reports. Users with the beta version of the messaging app will now be able to post their status to Facebook or share it through other apps such as Instagram. This feature was first revealed within the code of one of WhatsApp’s previous beta releases, and is now rolling out to the latest test version of the app. The company told The Verge that it is not linking users’ WhatsApp accounts with their Facebook profiles, and is instead making use of the same data-sharing APIs used by other applications. The latest beta version of WhatsApp also revealed another new feature which is not yet available: the ability hide muted status updates. WABetaInfo reported that WhatsApp is working on a feature which will allow users to completely hide the section within their app that lists all muted status updates. This functionality is not yet available, as it is still under active development.
