Demand for high-speed fibre broadband continues to grow in South Africa, with ADSL connections steadily becoming a relic of the past. Openserve has even said that it plans to turn off its copper network in the next five years, as maintaining this infrastructure is becoming increasingly expensive and customers are moving over to more efficient technology. Fibre is also cheaper than ADSL, making it the preferred option among fixed-broadband users wherever it is available. Uncapped high-speed fibre with no fair usage policy is the ideal connection for many South Africans, but this can be relatively expensive, especially considering the comparatively cheap price tag of capped packages. Capped fibre packages offer both high speeds and low data costs, with the option to purchase additional data each month in case you run out. This option is ideal for buyers looking for a fast but cheap fibre package, or for people who know roughly how much data they use per month and do not want to overspend on their connection. Capped packages often have the added advantage of not being shaped or throttled, unlike some cheaper uncapped packages. There are a wide variety of fibre network operators across South Africa, but we only included Openserve and Vumatel packages in our comparison. This allows us to portray the difference between fibre package costs on the two networks, as well as give readers a general idea of the cheapest capped packages from ISPs across different operators. Below are the best 100Mbps capped fibre packages on Vumatel and Openserve.
