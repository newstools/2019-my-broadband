South African cryptocurrrency exchange Luno has announced that it will be adding support for more cryptocurrencies in the coming months. Luno currently allows users to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum on its exchange platform, and offers users an online wallet which can be accessed through its website and mobile applications. The company said it has previously only supported these two cryptocurrencies to ensure the security of its platform and to refrain from offering any unscrupulous tokens. “While that position might appear to be overly conservative, we’d rather be conservative and ensure our customers are happy than the opposite way around,” Luno said. “We have concluded that there are other safe, interesting, and valuable crypto instruments that we currently don’t offer on our platform, and as of today we’re going to change that: We will be adding more cryptocurrencies in the coming months.” Luno said it is looking at added other decentralised cryptocurrencies in addition to some ERC-20 tokens and various types of stablecoins. “The order in which we introduce them, and the types of coins we introduce, will depend on various factors including customer demand, how high a coin scores in our internal assessments, as well as the resources required to implement them,” Luno said.
