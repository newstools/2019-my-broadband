Uber is working on integrating the Uber Eats platform into its main ride-hailing service, TechCrunch reports. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it was merging a fully-functional web version of Uber Eats into the Uber app. The report said that Uber started rolling out a pilot of the merged app in April 2019, adding that Uber Eats would remain available as a standalone app after the two services are merged. “We’re rolling out a new way to order Eats directly in the Uber app on Android (we’ve already been experimenting on iOS),” Uber said. “This cross-promotion gives riders who are new to Eats a seamless way to order a meal via a web view instead of opening up the App Store for download.” The Android version of the merged app has reportedly rolled out to 17% of users in Uber Eats’ international markets, although it is not available in cities where Uber offers bike and scooter rides.
