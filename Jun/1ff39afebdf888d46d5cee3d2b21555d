Speaking at the 2019 MyBroadband Conference, Microsoft Cloud Specialist Kevin George told delegates about the company’s recent launch of its Azure data centres in South Africa. “We are committed to Africa and the Middle-East, and bringing world-class technology and skills to local markets,” George said. He said that between year-end 2017 and year-end 2022, the recent launch of Microsoft’s Azure data centres will generate nearly 112,000 jobs in South Africa. Overall IT spending in South Africa is expected to total R175 billion in 2022, by which time IT employment will have surpassed 640,000. “Now that Microsoft Azure has landed, customers are looking at how to migrate practically to the cloud,” George said. He added that the uptake of the cloud platform has been impressive in South Africa so far. George also stressed that partners can be crucial for businesses looking to migrate to the cloud. He said that there are many factors to consider when creating your cloud migration strategy, from how you will be able to leverage existing hardware and software, to how you implement compliance with legislation like POPI and GDPR. “Partners can help you with migration to the cloud and your modernisation strategy,” George said. “There are many benefits that partners can give you.” He noted that there is a skills gap in the South African economy, and said partners can be crucial for providing the right skills to ensure the cloud migration is conducted properly. “Partners can help customers bridge that skills gap and bring in the resources needed to make the migration a success.”
