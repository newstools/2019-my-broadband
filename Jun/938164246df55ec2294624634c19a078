A new study on air pollution by Eskom, Sasol Synfuels, and Natref provided shocking evidence of the harmful effects caused by these organisations to the environment and to human health. The study was conducted by Dr. H. Andrew Gray of Gray Sky Solutions, an air pollution research consulting firm specializing in particulate matter (PM) and visibility issues. The study and research report focused on the air quality in and around South Africa’s Highveld Priority Area (HPA). It was included as expert evidence in High Court papers served on Friday 7 June 2019 to the President of South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, and the National Air Quality Officer. The legal action is aimed at “getting the minister to do her job” and ensure that air quality is improved in South Africa. Important results from the modelling and health risk assessment include: MyBroadband asked Eskom, Sasol, and Total for feedback regarding the findings of the study, but these companies did not respond by the time of publication.
