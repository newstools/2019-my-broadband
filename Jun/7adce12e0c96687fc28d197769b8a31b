Naspers Foundry announced it has invested R30 million in South African technology startup SweepSouth. SweepSouth is an online cleaning services platform often referred to as the “Uber for cleaning services”, which aims to easily connect clients with trusted, reliable domestic cleaners. Naspers Foundry is a R1.4-billion startup fund which was created to boost the South African technology sector by providing investment and helping talented entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. SweepSouth has established itself as a fast-growing tech start-up, creating more than 10,000 jobs since its launch while providing cleaners with full flexibility over their hours and availability. “We are ecstatic about the Naspers Foundry investment in SweepSouth, and believe the partnership will help us achieve our vision of expanding into other home services and growing beyond the South African market,” said SweepSouth co-founder Aisha Pandor. “We see ourselves as an emerging market-focused platform that aims to serve the many professionals who don’t have the time to source the services we provide, whilst also creating meaningful employment opportunities.” “We are excited to announce our first Naspers Foundry investment and to welcome SweepSouth to the Naspers family,” said Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk. “Naspers Foundry is off to a good start and we aim to announce more backing for South African start ups in the coming months.”
