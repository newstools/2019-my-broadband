Western Digital has suspended its partnership with Huawei and halted all shipments to the company, Nikkei Asian Review reported. The US storage company previously partnered with Huawei on mechanical hard drive and flash storage technology, along with providing Huawei with flash memory for its smartphones. A number of US companies have suspended their partnerships with Huawei following the placement of the Chinese company on the US Entity List, including Microsoft and Google. Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan told Nikkei that the company is working with the US government and considering a licence to resume trade with Huawei. Milligan added that the worldâ€™s tech supply chain is entangled, and suggested that this trade ban would not be good in the longer term for either the US or China.
