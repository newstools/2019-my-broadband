Samsung’s US customer support Twitter account recently published a tweet which warned users to scan their smart TV for viruses, Engadget reported. It quickly removed the tweet, but it was up for long enough to spark concern among many users over whether their Samsung smart TV posed a security risk to their networks. “Scanning your computer for malware viruses is important to keep it running smoothly,” said the tweet. “This also is true for your QLED TV if it’s connected to Wi-Fi!” The tweet also linked to a video which explained how to scan your TV and suggested that you should do this “every few weeks”. Since the tweet refers specifically to QLED TVs, it is possible that the tweet was posted in response to a particular threat which affects specific TV models. Samsung had not provided any statement regarding the tweet, or why it was removed, at the time of writing.
