At a recent event, Bill Gates said that his biggest mistake of his career was not beating Android in the non-Apple phone software battle. Gates was explaining how he believes that when developing any particular type of software, there will likely be a dominant winner in the market. “The greatest mistake ever is… whatever mismanagement I engaged in that caused Microsoft not to be what Android is,” said Gates. “There’s room for exactly one non-Apple operating system, and what’s that worth? $400 billion that would be transferred from company G [Google] to company M [Microsoft].” Microsoft attempted to dethrone Android with the release of its Windows Phone operating system in 2010, but has given up on its smartphone OS project, having announced that support for Windows 10 Mobile – its latest operating system – would end on 10 December 2019.
