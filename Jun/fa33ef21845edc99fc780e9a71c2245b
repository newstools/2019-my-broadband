Xerox, McAfee, and Cisco have teamed up on security for faster threat detection and response. Printer security has come a long way in the last several years. The advancements in network printers and multifunction printers make them a potential security risk from cyber threats that target printers specifically. Build a secure printer and a hacker will make it their mission to penetrate the security. That is where teaming up helps to stay ahead of the hackers. The team was created through partnership with McAfee, the global cybersecurity company and Cisco, the networking and security firm and Xerox Corporation. Utilizing McAfee’s ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and Cisco’s Identity Services Engine (ISE) allows centralized printer management of printer security policies. These new security capabilities are available for the Xerox ConnectKey i-Series, WorkCentre EC7836/7856 and AltaLink Multifunction Printers. Let’s look at how this partnership works in a real-world cyber threat.  If a threat is detected on your Xerox multifunction printer McAfee’s ePolicy Orchestrator will inform Cisco’s Identity Services Engine about the threat. In response to potential misuse, threat or attack, ePO and ISE apply the appropriate security policies to neutralize the threat to your printer(s) and other devices on the network. Crisis averted, security maintained. The result of this team approach is new to threat response. It is the first of its kind by being both automatic and instantaneous, leaving the hackers and threats outside and keeping your data and network secure.
