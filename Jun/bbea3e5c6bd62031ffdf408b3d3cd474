Apple is being sued by a New Jersey apartment complex and its insurance company two years after an iPad initiated a fire that killed one of its tenants in February 2017, reports Softpedia. Union Management and insurance firm Greater New York Mutual Insurance Company are claiming that Apple’s iPad was “unreasonably dangerous and unsafe for its intended purpose”. The pair are suing Apple for all damages that the fire caused, including the insurance Greater New York had to pay out to Union Management, as well as the latter’s additional costs which weren’t covered. According to the pair, Apple “should have known of the dangerous propensities of lithium batteries and their use in electronic devices such as the subject tablet”. Apple was previously sued by the victim’s wife, Julia Ireland Meo, who claimed that the fire was caused by “a defect in the subject tablet, specifically affecting the subject tablet’s battery pack”.
