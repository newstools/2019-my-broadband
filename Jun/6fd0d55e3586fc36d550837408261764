Vodacom has announced that its strategic repositioning of its Vodacom Business Africa operations will result in three share purchase agreements in African countries. It plans on entering into agreements with Synergy Communications in Nigeria, Zambia, and Ivory Coast, Internet Technologies Angola, and Vodafone Ghana. “Vodacom is not exiting any of the territories related to this transaction and remains focused on continuing to deliver exceptional service to our global and multinational clients in these markets through long-term commercial agreements,” said Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub. “Vodacom has a clear vision for strengthening our position as a leading pan-African business and will work with local service providers to grow in these markets,” he added. According to Vodacom, its new model is better suited to the digital economy, and will allow pan-African customers to access specialist divisions such as Vodacom’s IoT business.
