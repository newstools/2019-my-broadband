Newegg recently added an option for shoppers to set their delivery location as South Africa on its global website. A range of PC hardware, tech products, smartphones, and other items are listed on the online retailerâ€™s storefront, with their pricing now being available in South African rand. For each product, Newegg provides the price of the item, its estimated delivery costs, and the estimated duties and VAT you will need to pay before checking out. Standard and express shipping options are available, with the former taking 3-5 business days and the latter shipping the product in 2-3 days. Product prices on international retailers like Newegg can differ substantially from local online retailers, although the duties and delivery costs of international retailers can often make it a better option to purchase products locally. Takealot, for example, offers free delivery on many products within 2-5 working days, as well as an option to pick up your purchase from a designated pick-up point. We compared the pricing of various tech products across specific categories on both Newegg and Takealot to determine when it was better to order items from the global retailer. Prices were rounded to the nearest rand, and the Newegg prices featured below include delivery fees, VAT, and other duties. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-294758" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Samsung-860-Evo.jpg" alt="Samsung 860 Evo" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Samsung-860-Evo.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Samsung-860-Evo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Samsung-860-Evo-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-272669" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MSI-GeForce-RTX-2080-Ti-Gaming-X-Trio.jpg" alt="MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Gaming X Trio" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MSI-GeForce-RTX-2080-Ti-Gaming-X-Trio.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MSI-GeForce-RTX-2080-Ti-Gaming-X-Trio-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MSI-GeForce-RTX-2080-Ti-Gaming-X-Trio-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-275281 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iPhone-Xr-1.jpg" alt="iPhone Xr 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iPhone-Xr-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iPhone-Xr-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iPhone-Xr-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-279123" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Intel-Core-i9-9th-Gen.jpg" alt="Intel Core i9 9th Gen" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Intel-Core-i9-9th-Gen.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Intel-Core-i9-9th-Gen-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Intel-Core-i9-9th-Gen-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
