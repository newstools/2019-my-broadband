Apple has revealed its new Mac operating system – macOS Catalina. Catalina features improved support for app creation along with updated Apple apps for Mac systems. Apple said that Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV have all been updated to include new features, such as 4K HDR playback support on the Mac and spatial audio support from its speakers. Apple also introduced a new second-screen option for users who do not have a monitor on hand, called Sidecar. Sidecar lets Mac owners use an iPad as a second display in place of a traditional monitor. Full voice control for Mac, which lets users control their device with voice commands via Siri, is another new feature in macOS Catalina. Apple introduced a new “find my Mac” feature with Catalina which combines “find my iPhone” with “find my friends”. It allows users to find their Mac even when it is switched off and not connected to a network. The Mac will send out a Bluetooth signal to other Apple devices near it, which then relays the device’s location to Apple. This is all end-to-end encrypted, said the company. ScreenTime for usage notifications on Mac has also been introduced, along with Project Catalyst – an easier way to build apps for macOS. Project Catalyst allows developers to create apps for the Mac based on iPad apps, and then place them on the app store. The developer preview of macOS is available to Apple Developer Programme members from today and a public beta will be launched later this month. macOS Catalina will be available later this year as a free software update for Macs introduced in mid-2012 or later.
