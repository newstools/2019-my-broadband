Estimates provided by Cowen suggest that Apple is increasing its iPhone production in response to Huawei’s struggles with the US. AppleInsider reports that Cowen has accelerated its iPhone production and shipment predictions for Q2 2019 from 39 million to 40 million units. The estimates suggest that 30 million of these units are split between their three most recent iPhones – the Xr, Xs, and Xs Max – with the other 10 million mostly consisting of iPhone 7 and 8 smartphones. Cowen also predicts that Apple faces medium-term financial risks due to US tariffs imposed on hardware manufactured in China. Cowen also predicted that the 2019 iPhone range will see LCD display versions of the new iPhones launching alongside the OLED versions – a change in strategy from 2018, where there was a staggered release of these two display types.
