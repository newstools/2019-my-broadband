The Dell Technologies Forum took place at the Sandton Convention Centre on 27 June, where thought leaders in the tech space provided valuable insight into the world of technology. The keynote speaker at the event was Dell Global CTO for Sales Patricia Florissi, who spoke about how the future of the world would be defined by technology. “We believe that technology has the ability to unlock and accelerate human progress,” said Florissi. “Data is fundamentally different from the other resources we have because it is not exhaustible.” Dell has invested over $30 billion in the past 5 years into innovative technologies and believes that continued investment is important to drive business success and, by extension, a better society. However, Florissi said, research conducted by Dell in 2018 found that only 28% of organisations had mature digital plans, investments, and innovations in place. For companies that were not built within the modern, digitally-focused business framework, Florissi said that it can be very expensive to transform. She believes that every business needs to be a digital organisation, powered by data and running in a multi-cloud system. Florissi highlighted four main technological movements currently taking place, which must be engaged with if your business doesn’t want to be left behind: The event, which was sponsored by Microsoft and Intel, also served as a platform for Dell and its partners to showcase some of its  coolest tech products. These included powerful gaming laptops, VR technology, and impressive displays.
