Last month, the inDriver ride-hailing platform launched in Johannesburg after landing in Cape Town earlier this year. The app aims to compete with Uber and Bolt in the city by offering cheaper rides thanks to its unique bargaining system. “We want to give the power of setting prices back into the hands of passengers and drivers by countering price surging used by other ride-hailing companies,” said inDriver spokesperson Rifqa Carr. According to inDriver, passengers using its app pay an average of 20-30% less than they would using other services. The app uses what it calls a Real-Time Deal (RTD) payment model to ensure the best deal possible for both the driver and rider at the time of the ride. In simple terms, inDriver allows passengers to set their own fare for their chosen route, entering their pickup and drop-off destination into the app and waiting for a driver to respond. Drivers are then presented with the passenger’s offer and have three options – accept, reject, or bargain. “Drivers have the freedom to choose whichever ride request they like, without any risk of being penalised,” Carr said. “They’re also able to see the full fare, from point A to point B, and can then decide if they want to accept the request – or not.” inDriver also charges drivers 0% commission for the first few months, encouraging them to use the platform over other options. Becoming a driver is very simple using the inDriver app, and requires the submission of the driver’s photo, a photo of their vehicle, their vehicle registration certificate, and their driver’s licence with a professional driving permit. To determine how much cheaper inDriver is than Uber and Bolt, we decided to view trip requests within the app and compare the price offered for these trips to the standard fares for Uber and Bolt. It should be noted that we cannot see the final price agreed upon by the rider and driver within the app, only the initial requests made by passengers. This means that inDriver’s pricing could be skewed lower due to passengers attempting to undercharge for trips. Below are the prices for Johannesburg-based trips on inDriver, Bolt, and Uber.  inDriver is demonstrably the cheaper application in all trips we compared, with Bolt coming in second. It is important to note that Bolt gives a fare estimation with a minimum and maximum price, and we subsequently average out this figure to provide a better comparison. while inDriver is cheaper than its competitors, it offers relatively few features. There is no ability to split the fare with other riders or select a specific type of ride. Signing up as an inDriver driver through the app does not present the user with any vehicle requirements either, meaning that the quality of rides may be lower than stricter apps like Uber. inDriver is considerably cheaper than Uber and Bolt for longer rides however, and if affordability is your top concern it should be the preferred choice for longer trips.
