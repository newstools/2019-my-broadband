Steam has released its latest hardware survey, which shows reduced gains in market share for Nvidia’s latest-generation RTX graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 earned the range’s biggest increase, with a 0.14% boost through May – although this is still only about half the increase it saw in April. The GeForce RTX 2070 saw a 0.1% boost, and remains the most popular RTX graphics card despite being used by less than 1% of Steam’s player base. This adoption rate pales in comparison to the most popular graphics card overall – the GeForce GTX 1060 – which is used by 15.89% of the Steam market. The least-popular GTX 10-series GPU, the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, still boasts significantly more market share than the most popular RTX graphics card, with 1.27% of Steam users using this GPU. Meanwhile, the most popular AMD graphics card – the Radeon RX 580 – boasts an adoption rate of 1.2% among gamers on Steam.
