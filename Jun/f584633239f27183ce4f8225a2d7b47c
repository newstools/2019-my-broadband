Microsoft has launched a new feature for OneDrive named Personal Vault, which allows users to add an extra layer of security to specific folders. Personal Vault allows users to activate two-factor authentication for specific folders in their cloud storage archive. After activation, folders secured with Personal Vault will require the user to authenticate their identity with biometric verification, PIN, email, or SMS codes. “Your locked files in Personal Vault have an extra layer of security, keeping them more secured in the event that someone gains access to your account or your device,” Microsoft said. Personal Vault can also be unlocked with the Microsoft Authenticator app, and users can save images and other files directly to the vault. In addition to adding two-factor authentication for cloud access, Windows 10 also syncs Personal Vault files to a Bitlocker-encrypted area of your local hard drive.
