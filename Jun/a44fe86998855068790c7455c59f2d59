Earlier this year, a MyBroadband reader was able to contact the SABC and cancel their TV licence. The reader was able to accomplish this difficult feat by proving that he no longer possessed a TV and that he was leaving the country. The e-mail support provided by the SABC was far from impressive in this case, but it did eventually result in the reader cancelling his TV licence. Technically, you should be able to cancel your TV licence for a number of reasons, including storing your TV away for an extended period of time or travelling overseas for more than 12 months. However, judging from the aforementioned reader’s experience in cancellation, it could prove difficult to cancel your TV licence unless you plan to leave the country permanently. Upon requesting the cancellation of a TV licence, the SABC replies to users with a letter stating the requirements for cancellation. The SABC requires the following documentation to process a TV licence holder’s cancellation: “Should no such prescribed documentation be provided to the SABC, an account will not be closed and, should a licence holder return to South Africa at a later stage, their television licence would have remained active and would obviously reflect a substantial overdue balance,” the SABC states in its cancellation documentation. These documents must be submitted to the SABC via email or fax. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303888" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SABC-Form.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="767" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SABC-Form.jpg 657w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SABC-Form-334x400.jpg 334w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SABC-Form-359x430.jpg 359w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While you should not need to continue paying a TV licence if you do not own a television, it seems that emigration is a requirement of the process. “For the SABC to consider your request, please complete the enclosed pro forma affidavit,” the SABC’s cancellation documentation states. The affidavit in question requires that users assert one of two scenarios. The first scenario requires that licence holders emigrated for a period in the past and have now returned to South Africa and do not own a TV, and the second requires that licence holders assert that they plan to emigrate from or have already left South Africa. This affidavit must be signed by the licence holder and witnessed by a Commissioner of Oaths, and requires users to provide their identity number and TV licence account number. South Africans should be able to cancel their TV licences if they do not own a television or any other way of receiving and decoding broadcast signals from the SABC, but there is very little accommodation for this cancellation reason within the SABC’s documentation. In fact, it seems that emigration is the only easily-accepted reason for cancellation of a TV licence in South Africa. If you fall into one of the categories above and are brave enough to negotiate with the SABC through its email support system, you can attempt to cancel your TV licence by sending a mail to tvlic.info@sabc.co.za.
