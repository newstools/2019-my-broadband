The 2019 MyBroadband Cloud Conference this year attracted over 1,100 ICT executives and managers from across South Africa and neighbouring countries. The event took place at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand on 6 June 2019 and is known to be South Africa’s premier event of its kind. The executive sponsor of the event was none other than Huawei, which presented its full cloud stack consisting of three different platforms which have unified architecture, eco-system and experience across all the cloud platforms – the private cloud, hybrid cloud, and the public hyperscale cloud. Huawei Technologies’ IT Director for Cloud and Data Center Solutions Marcus Tay was also one of the speakers at the conference and gave an overview of cloud platforms, security, and Huawei’s growing cloud capabilities.
