With the winter holidays just around the corner, and a short getaway planned for you and the family, you might be wondering whether you should invest in a new smartphone so you can take the very best photos of these precious shared moments. But great smartphones come with a high price tag, right? Well, not if you consider the new Huawei Y5. The RRP of the Huawei Y5 is a very affordable R1999, and it includes a 13MP camera with a large aperture of f/1.8. A large aperture comes in handy when the kids can’t keep still for the camera, as it means fewer blurry photos. Best of all, the phone comes with a 32GB memory, so you can take as many shots as you want, and won’t have to spend precious holiday time deleting photos to free up memory. This offer also comes with a R100 Voucher or 32 GB SD card, for even more storage space.* You’ll also love the leather-feel back cover of this device, which is not only stylish but also protects your phone against wear and tear and prevents ugly fingerprint marks. Another thing we tend to do during the holidays is spend a lot of time catching up on series, watching movies, surfing the net, and checking social media. A tablet that offers immersive entertainment with unrivalled audio and video is ideal for this. Enter the new Huawei Mediapad T5 with its advanced hardware (8-Core CPU) and software (Android 8.0). It also comes at a great price – R3499, a saving of R500 on the RRP. The tablet’s avant-garde design and its metallic body is also very sleek. What’s more, the Huawei Mediapad T5 comes with a free cover*, so your tablet is protected while you indulge in some binge-watching.
