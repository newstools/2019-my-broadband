If you worked in a permanent location for 2 years, you may consider purchasing a motor vehicle for daily mobility. But if you were only there for 2 months, then it would be better to take advantage of a rental vehicle. Similarly, not entirely all your ICT hardware should be purchased outright. At Qrent, we understand the importance of these short-term ICT needs and we have come up with a practical, cost-effective ICT solution that can save you significant amounts and provide you with high quality, corporate-grade IT hardware only for the period you use it for. Serves for any occasion; in any quantity; whenever it may be required. We have a large stockholding of uniform Tier 1 brands (Dell, Lenovo, HP, Apple) equipment, so you won’t need to mix and match models. Available on demand as you do with a rented car. The Qrent Short-Term IT rental solution is focused on providing both financial relief as well as a technology solution for your short-term IT hardware requirements. Some advantages that you get with each rental include: Many small to large organisations have already realised big savings in cost and effectiveness with this smart alternative solution.
