Uber recently announced that it was integrating the Uber Eats platform into its Uber application. The company said it was merging a fully-functional web version of Uber Eats into its main ride-hailing app, allowing customers to order both rides and food through the same application. Uber began rolling out a pilot of the merged app earlier this year, and said that Uber Eats will still remain available as a standalone app after being integrated into the Uber app. “We’re rolling out a new way to order Eats directly in the Uber app on Android (we’ve already been experimenting on iOS),” the company stated. “This cross-promotion gives riders who are new to Eats a seamless way to order a meal via a web view instead of opening up the App Store for download.” Uber told MyBroadband that reports of the apps being merged were correct and confirmed that this would also roll out to South African users. Uber added that the Android version of this application had already begun rolling out to Uber riders in various markets. The company said it planned to merge the Uber Eats platform into the Uber app for all riders. “The Android version is already out to 17% of riders across 500 of Uber Eats’ markets, including South Africa, with the goal of the cross-promotional tool being available to all riders,” Uber said. The company did not provide any details regarding the rollout of the same functionality for the iOS version of the Uber app.
