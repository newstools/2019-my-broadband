Microsoft has begun showing its upcoming dual-screen Surface device to employees within the company, The Verge reports. The company reportedly allowed employees to try out a prototype version of the laptop-tablet hybrid and played a teaser video for the new hardware. Windows Central reported last year that Microsoft had code-named its dual-screen Surface PC “Centaurus”. Centaurus will have a similar design to Microsoft’s cancelled Courier project, offering two side-by-side displays which fold open like a book. The hardware is expected to run a lightweight version of the core Windows 10 operating system built specifically for dual-screen devices and Chromebook competitors. The report said that along with showing off the Centaurus prototype to employees, Microsoft also teased its new xCloud gaming service and a prototype version of Microsoft Teams.
