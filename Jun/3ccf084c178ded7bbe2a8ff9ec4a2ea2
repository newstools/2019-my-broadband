Speaking during a panel discussion at the 2019 MyBroadband Cloud Conference, Mimecast Sales Engineer for the Middle East and Africa Mikey Molfessis refuted the predicted death of email. While many have predicted that email will die in the near future, Molfessis said he does not expect email to go anywhere. “Email has been around for decades,” he said. “When people get to work in the morning, they always start up their email client before anything else.” “Email has just constantly grown. We now scan billions of emails a month, and it just keeps growing. It isn’t age specific – there are teenagers, older people, and corporates using emails.” Also present on the discussion panel was VMWare Cloud Provider Manager Dave Funnell, who spoke about the challenges and obstacles when migrating to the cloud. He noted that there is a significant amount of cloud adoption in South Africa. “Adoption of SaaS and platforms like Office 365 has been great,” Funnell said. “Connectivity has also become a lot cheaper and has more resilience, and there is a requirement for localised cloud.” He said that when it comes to problems with cloud migration, security can be a big issue in some cases, and there is a need for properly-planned migrations tailored to companies’ requirements.
