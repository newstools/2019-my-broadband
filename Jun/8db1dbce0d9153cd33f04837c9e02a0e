Samsung display vice president Kim Seong-cheol has told an audience in Seoul that the Galaxy Fold is almost ready to be launched to the masses, TechCrunch reported. “Most of the display problems have been ironed out,” said Kim, “and the Galaxy Fold is ready to hit the market.” A Samsung representative said earlier this month that the Galaxy Fold’s release schedule has not yet been decided, and Kim did not provide any further indication of a possible release date. Samsung is expected to be particularly thorough in ensuring all technical issues with the foldable smartphone are solved before releasing it to the public. Previous reports indicated that Samsung has reduced the size of the Galaxy Fold’s hinge and increased the size of its plastic screen cover to solve some of the issues evident in the original version of the handset.
