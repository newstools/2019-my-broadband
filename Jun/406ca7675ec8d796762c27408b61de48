Google has published an official render of its new Pixel 4 smartphone on Twitter, giving users the first look at the company’s design for its new smartphone. This follows leaked renders of the Pixel 4 being published online, revealing a change in design from previous Pixel smartphones. Google’s official render for the new smartphone shows that the device will have at least two rear cameras housed in a large square camera bump. There is also no rear fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 4, which could mean that Google has implemented an in-display fingerprint sensor below an OLED panel. It is expected that Google’s Pixel 4 smartphones will not feature a notch on their displays and will come in bigger sizes than previous generations. Google’s new smartphone is expected to launch in October 2019.
