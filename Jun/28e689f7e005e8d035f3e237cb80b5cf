Huawei has delayed the launch of its Mate X foldable smartphone until September 2019. This announcement comes amid uncertainty about the future of Huawei devices due to the blacklisting of the company by the US government, but a spokesperson said did not cite this as a reason for the delay. The company told CNBC that it had delayed the launch as it was conducting additional tests on its device to ensure it isn’t met with the same problems as Samsung’s foldable smartphone. Huawei’s Mate X foldable device was originally projected to launch in June or July, and was first unveiled in February 2019. The Huawei Mate X will be available in South Africa in one colour option – Interstellar Blue – and a full protection case will be available when the device ships. There is currently no local pricing available for the Mate X, but it is expected to be priced at around €2,299 internationally.
