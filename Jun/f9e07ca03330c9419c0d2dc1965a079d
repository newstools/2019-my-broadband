Oppo has unveiled the world’s first under-screen camera at MWC Shanghai 2019. The company has developed this technology to combat the problem of notches and cutouts which pervade modern smartphone screens across the market. Instead of placing a notch at the top of the display to hide the front-facing camera, Oppo has found a way to place the camera itself behind the screen, allowing it to implement fully bezel-less display designs for its upcoming smartphones. The manufacturer said that the display uses a transparent material with a redesigned pixel structure that allows light to pass through the screen and into the camera’s lens. Oppo said the area of the screen above the camera still works with touch controls, and it has implemented a number of intelligent adjustments to combat any increased glare or colour cast. The company said it plans to launch a device with an in-screen selfie camera in the near future.
