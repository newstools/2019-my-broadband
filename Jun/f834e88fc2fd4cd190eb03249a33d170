The high price of mobile data is a common complaint among South Africans, who want networks to make access to mobile internet more affordable. According to Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub, one of the main reasons for high data prices is a lack of spectrum allocation by government. “Lengthy delays in completing the digital migration and allocating 4G spectrum has curbed the pace at which data prices could have fallen,” said Joosub. Once mobile carriers receive ample spectrum, said Joosub, South African consumers would find relief almost immediately. Given how expensive mobile data can be in South Africa, it is important that you choose the deals that best suit your needs. There are many factors that come into play, including the amount of data, coverage in your area, and of course pricing. Mobile networks usually include night-time data on their SIM-only data contracts, which can be useful when scheduling downloads and updates.
