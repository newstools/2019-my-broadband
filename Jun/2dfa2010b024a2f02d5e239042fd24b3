SafetyDetective’s research lab has unearthed a data breach which exposed 3GB of data affecting over 1.6 million people. The leaked information was stored on a server in Mumbai, India, and contained personal contact information and other data on employers and job seekers from around the world. Information on job seekers exposed in the data breach included their direct phone numbers, titles, current employers, salary expectations, job seeking status, and other private information. Personal information on high-ranking professionals was also exposed in this breach, such as the direct contact numbers of various CEOs, CISOs, and high-ranking government employees – including the CTO of the Australian government. Encrypted passwords of over 50,000 user records were also exposed in the leak. Professionals and job seekers from the United States, India, UK, France, Australia, Hong Kong, and many other countries were included in this data breach. SafetyDetective informed the database owners of the breach and it has subsequently been fixed, although the hosting company has not yet provided a statement on the issue.
