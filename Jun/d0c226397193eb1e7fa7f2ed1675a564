Amazon has announced that it will run its annual Prime Day sale on 15 and 16 July, claiming that it will offer “a two-day parade of epic deals”. Prime Day offers Amazon Prime subscribers specials on over one million products, including some great tech deals. Amazon has already unveiled some of its deals, including a 43-inch Toshiba HD Fire TV Edition Smart TV for $179.99, a saving of $120. The company has launched a new “Lightning Deals” element to the sale, which will include “jaw-dropping prices on top-tier brands”. These Lightning Deals will have limited quantities and will constantly be refreshed throughout the 48-hour period of the sale. Amazon will also release a variety of new products which will be available exclusively to Prime users for a limited time. These products include new headphones, earphones, and budget smartphones. While South Africans can subscribe to Amazon Prime, it is worth noting that not all products on Amazon are available to be shipped directly to South Africa.
