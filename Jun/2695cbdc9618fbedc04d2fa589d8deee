Google Maps has added an on-screen speedometer to its navigation interface, Android Police reports. This forms part of Google’s integration of Waze features into its primary Maps navigation app, including speed camera notifications and speed limit indicators. When this real-time speed tracker and the speed limit indicator is turned on, Maps will reportedly notify you when you are speeding. The report said that the on-screen speedometer can be turned on in the Navigation Settings menu within the app’s preferences. Google has only rolled out this new feature to a few users around the world, and it is not yet integrated with the Android Auto platform, the report stated.
