CareerJunction has released its latest CareerJunction Index (CJI) report which shows that software development is the most in-demand skill in South Africa. The CJI is based on data gathered from the CareerJunction website and monitors the labour market in South Africa by examining supply and demand trends. According to the report, software developers remain the most sought-after professionals on CareerJunction. The demand for software developers remains very high despite the volatile demand for these skills in 2019. Other in-demand skills include middle and department management, company reps, and sales consulting. While the ICT sector remains the top employer, it displayed volatile demand trends during the last three quarters. IT job volumes remain lower than the previous year, and they continued to decrease during May.
