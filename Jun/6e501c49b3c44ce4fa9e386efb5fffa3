President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his state of the nation address on Thursday, promising to reduce the high price of mobile data. Ramaphosa said the government will expand South Africa’s high-tech industry by ensuring that the legal and regulatory framework promotes innovation. He added that they will scale up skills development for young people in new technologies, and reduce data costs. “Wherever we have gone young people have continuously raised the issue of the excessive high data costs in South Africa,” said Ramaphosa. “To provide impetus to this process, within the next month, the Minister of Communications will issue the policy direction to ICASA to commence the spectrum licensing process.” This process, Ramaphosa said, will include measures to promote competition, transformation, inclusive growth of the sector and universal access. “This is a vital part of bringing down the costs of data, which is essential both for economic development and for unleashing opportunities for young people,” he said. Ramaphosa called on the telecommunications industry further to bring down the cost of data so that it is in line with other countries in the world.
