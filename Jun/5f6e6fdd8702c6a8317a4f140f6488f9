Opera has announced its new Opera GX Internet browser, which it claims is the first-ever gaming browser. Opera GX is based on the standard version of Opera, with additional features having that cater specifically to the gaming market. GX Control is one of these new features, and it allows users to set limits on how much memory and processing power the browser is allowed to consume. The RAM limiter has two settings. Default allows the browser to slightly exceed these limits if it won’t impede on the user’s experience in other apps, while Hard Limit doesn’t let the browser exceed the limit at all. Opera GX also features Twitch integration, displaying followed channels, online streamers, and the option to receive notifications when someone you follow starts their stream. An early access version of Opera GX is already available to download on Windows PCs, with the final version expected to launch later this year.
