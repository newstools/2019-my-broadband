Huawei is inviting Play Store developers to publish their apps on its AppGallery app store, XDA Developers reported. The move comes after Google cancelled Huawei’s Android licence last month due to Huawei being placed on the US Entity List. An anonymous developer showed XDA Developers an email which invited them to join AppGallery, promising developers full support on the platform. According to the email, AppGallery has 270 million monthly active users on over 350 million phones, and half of these phones are sold outside of China. The email also offers recipients a free invitation to its developer community, which reportedly spans over 560,000 members. Huawei currently has a three-month general licence to continue using the Google-certified version of Android, but the future is uncertain for the company once this ends – forcing the company to make alternative arrangements.
