Showmax has launched a live sport streaming trial in South Africa, allowing select users to watch live sport on the platform. The company has also added pre-recorded sport content to its platform. Showmax said the following content is available as part of the trial, which is being tested with a randomly-selected group of customers: The live sport option is available on several Showmax apps and platforms, excluding the Apple TV, Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and certain smart TVs. Users will know if they have access to the sport trial by looking for the “Sport” option on the main navigation bar, after series and movies. As stated by Showmax on Twitter, there are no plans at the moment to offer full bouquets of sport – but they do plan to test different content on the service over time.
