Fibre is continuing to take market share from ADSL in South Africa as customers move from ageing copper technology to more reliable infrastructure. Telkom has even begun actively transferring ADSL customers to newer technologies with the aim of deactivating its copper network in five years. ADSL is prone to a number of problems, including far more instances of cable theft than competing technologies. Fibre has also become cheaper than ADSL in many cases, and it can deliver much faster speeds than the older technology. To see what is on offer when it comes to uncapped fibre in South Africa, we compared uncapped packages across several major ISPs for the two biggest network operators â€“ Openserve and Vumatel. It is important to note that the terms and conditions for each ISP package is different, and can be found on their respective websites. Some uncapped packages included in this comparison are available on a month-to-month basis, while others require a 24-month contract to be signed. The fair usage policy (FUP), throttling, and shaping rules for each package also differ depending on price and ISP, and buyers should investigate these policies before deciding between uncapped fibre packages. We compared the cheapest uncapped packages available from local ISPs to determine the best-priced deals, while also noting the fair usage policy for each uncapped package.
