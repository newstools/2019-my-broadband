Microsoft plans to launch a foldable Surface laptop-tablet hybrid in the first half of 2020, IHS Markit consumer electronics associate director Jeff Lin told Forbes. The upcoming device will reportedly sport a pair of 9-inch screens, both of which will have a 4:3 aspect ratio. According to the report, the foldable Microsoft Surface will run Windows Core OS and could also support Android applications to extend the selection of apps optimised for dual-display devices. Microsoft is also planning to include Intelâ€™s 10nm Lakefield system-on-chip in the device, which is expected to support LTE or 5G connectivity. The company teased its upcoming dual-screen foldable surface earlier this month, allowing employees to try out a prototype version of the hardware.
