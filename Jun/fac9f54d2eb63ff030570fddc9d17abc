NetMarketShare has released its May 2019 desktop operating system market share data, which shows that Windows 10 continues to extend its lead over Windows 7. Windows 10 now boasts a 45.73% portion of the desktop OS market share, a significant increase from Aprilâ€™s 44.10% figure. Windows 7, meanwhile, continues to lose market share, decreasing nearly a whole percentage point from 36.43% to 35.44% over the last month. macOS 10.14 has seen a slight increase in its market share, while Windows 8.1 lost 0.25% market share, falling to under 4%. Windows 10 took over from Windows 7 as the most popular desktop operating system in December 2018, and has since grown a substantial lead over the older operating system. Users with Windows 7 installed will need to upgrade to Windows 10 by 14 January 2020 to avoid losing support for their operating system.
