ASUS showed off its latest collection of high-end laptops and hardware from Computex 2019 at a launch event in Johannesburg, South Africa. The company showcased its latest ZenBook and gaming notebooks at the event, including its new ZenBook Pro Duo, which includes a built-in secondary touch screen display on the main body of the computer. Users can run up to three applications side-by-side on the secondary screen, ASUS said, and you can extend a full screen application from your primary screen onto the secondary screen. ASUS South Africa said the ZenBook Pro Duo will launch in South Africa in August 2019, starting from R39,999. The company’s new ZenBook 14 and 15 will be available in South Africa from August, starting from R26,999. MyBroadband attended the launch event and had the opportunity to try out the powerful hardware on display, including the new ZenBook Pro Duo. The dual-screen layout of the ZenBook Pro Duo offers a unique experience, as the secondary 4K touch screen can be used just like a standard Windows display. ASUS’ ZenBook Pro Duo is an impressive device, but it is not the only device in the new lineup with a secondary touch screen. The new VivoBook S and ZenBook laptops sport the manufacturer’s ScreenPad 2.0, which is  a screen placed just below the keyboard that acts as both a secondary display and a standard touch pad for navigation. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus was also on show at the event, as well as the company’s Ryzen-powered TUF Gaming notebooks, which boast impressive hardware packed into a slim form factor, Photos of the new ASUS laptops are posted below.
