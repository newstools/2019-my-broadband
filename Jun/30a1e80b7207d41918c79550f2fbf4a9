IBM has announced the expansion of its quantum computing efforts to Africa in a new collaboration with Wits University. “To expand the IBM Q Network to include Wits will drive innovation in frontier-technologies and benefit African-based researchers, academics and students who now have access to decades of quantum computing capabilities at the click of a button,” said Professor Zeblon Vilakazi, Wits Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Research and Postgraduate Affairs. As part of the partnership between IBM and Wits, students from 16 African universities will have the opportunity to apply for access to IBM Q’s quantum computing systems. “For Africa to remain competitive for the coming decades we must get the next generation of students quantum ready,” said Dr. Solomon Assefa, VP of emerging market solutions and director of IBM research in Africa. To gain access to the IBM Q quantum cloud service, students will be required to submit research proposals to a scientific committee of Wits and IBM experts for approval.
