Broadband Infraco said that the government is looking to use it as the entity that assists in the development of a fibre super highway which spans across Southern Africa. The proposed “SADC Super Highway” would be created through the joint investment of SADC countries, and would improve SADC infrastructure with the goal of enabling potential growth in the region. Broadband Infraco said that great network infrastructure, sound financial support, and meaningful partnerships are key to unlocking potential growth for SADC. “The ultimate outcome of this initiative is that at least at an infrastructure level we can ensure that the reach of optical fibre, which is what you need for back-hauling high volumes of data, reaches South Africa, but also large parts of our neighbouring countries,” Broadband Infraco CEO Andrew Matseke said. Broadband Infraco currently connects the borders of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland, Lesotho, and all seven of the neighbouring countries, which Matseke believes could result in massive growth for these markets.
