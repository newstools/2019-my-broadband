The biggest mistake jobseekers make when applying for a job is not to research the industry or the company which they are applying to. This is the view of CipherWave managing director Wayne D’Sa, who said there is a big demand for technical skills like voice engineers and cloud professionals in their industry. However, to find a job in the telecommunications and ISP fields takes more than just technical knowledge. D’Sa said they want to see that a candidate is passionate about customer service before appointing them. “We want to ensure that all our employees will help people to solve problems and are able to work in a fast-pace environment,” he said. D’Sa advised jobseekers to find an industry which they are passionate about and do a lot of research on that industry. Before submitting a CV and cover letter for a new job, it is important to research the company and get a good understanding of what they do. Tailoring your CV and cover letter to suit the company and position you are applying for will significantly increase your chances of success. “A lot of candidates don’t research a company prior to an interview – this is a big mistake,” D’Sa said. MultiChoice Connected Video spokesperson Richard Boorman echoed D’SA’s advice, saying “if you’re not applying for a specific job, it generally won’t help to just send your CV hoping it hits the mark.” For smaller companies, emailing your CV to a generic “Dear Sir/Madam BCC distribution list” just tells the reader that they can ignore the email. “Instead, approach people directly. Do your research about that person, their role, their company and their industry,” Boorman said. “Then write a succinct personalised note that grabs their attention and gives them a reason to read the rest of what you’ve got to say.” “They may not have a job for you, but maybe they know someone who does. Grammar and spelling are hyper-important – sloppy notes get deleted quickly.”
