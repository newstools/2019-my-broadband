Various websites around the world were inaccessible today due to network performance issues at Cloudflare. Attempting to access websites hosted behind Cloudflare – including MyBroadband and Takealot – resulted in a “Connection timed out” error. Cloudflare published an update to its status page stating that it was observing network performance issues. DownDetector‘s outage map showed a surge in reports of problems with Cloudflare, and the company’s support staff confirmed the presence of network issues. “We are currently aware of issues in network connectivity and our network operations team are engaged in restoring services,” the company said. “We will keep you notified as soon as we get updates.” This issue has since been fixed for certain users, although it is unclear when services will be restored for all users.
