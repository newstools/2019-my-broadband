Chinese government officials have warned a number of tech companies of “dire consequences” for cooperating with the US government’s ban on Huawei, The New York Times reports. The Chinese government reportedly warned major tech companies including Microsoft, Dell, and Samsung against cooperating with the US ban. According to the report, China told US tech companies that Trump’s ban on Huawei disrupted the globally supply chain and hinted that they should use lobbying to fight the government ban. Tech companies outside of the US were told that if they continued to maintain their current relationships and supply chains with Chinese companies including Huawei, they would not face any consequences. This follows a recent report that Google warned the US government that the Huawei ban would result in security risks and asked to be exempt from the export restrictions.
