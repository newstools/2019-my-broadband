Huawei was recently placed on the US Entity List, causing its Android licence to be revoked and casting uncertainty on the future of its operating system solution for smartphones. The company said it has a Plan B in place for many core platforms however, including the development of its own operating system in case it is unable to use the certified version of Android in future. This operating system was reportedly code-named Hong Meng, but recent filings with the German Patent and Trademark Office indicate that the upcoming OS might be officially named “Ark OS”. According to a report from WinFuture, Huawei has registered this name in a number of patent filings across various regions. The company’s patent filings include screenshots displaying the operating system’s interface, which shares some features with Android’s UI. Ark OS may also include support for Android applications, although if Google does not restore Huawei’s Android licence it may be unable to ship with the Google Play Store or certified Google apps. Below are leaked screenshots of Huawei’s Ark OS platform.
