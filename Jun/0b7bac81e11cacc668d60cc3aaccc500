Mozilla plans to launch a new subscription service named Firefox Premium, Mozilla CEO Chris Beard said in an interview with T3N. Firefox Premium will not mean that browser users will need to pay for a new version of the Firefox browser, but instead the service will comprise a number of useful services offered as an add-on to consumers. These offerings will include a cloud storage platform and a VPN services, Beard said. Firefox Premium is set to launch in October 2019 and there will also be a free version of the platform available, although restrictions on cloud storage space and VPN bandwidth will be imposed on free users. Beard said that Mozilla aimed to diversify its income streams through the launch of Firefox Premium, as 90% of the companyâ€™s revenue currently comes from its search business.
