Mozilla has released  security updates to fix a critical vulnerability in its browser software. The company said it was aware of targeted attacks which actively exploit this security flaw to take control of vulnerable systems. Through this exploit, attackers are able to inject code into the user’s system if they visit a page while running an unpatched version of the Firefox browser. A statement issued by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency urged users to review Mozilla’s advisory and update their systems immediately. “The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) encourages users and administrators to review the Mozilla Security Advisory for Firefox 67.0.3 and Firefox ESR 60.7.1 and apply the necessary updates,” the agency said.
