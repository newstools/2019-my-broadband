Samsung recently unveiled its new lineup of Notebook laptops, which sport a similar design to Apple’s MacBook Pro devices. The devices are also aimed at a similar audience to that of the MacBook Pro – content creators and consumers looking for high-end performance in a slim and lightweight device. Headlining Samsung’s new Notebook 7 range is the Notebook 7 Force, which features similar specifications to Apple’s latest MacBook Pro 15-inch laptop. There are some differences between the two devices, not least of which is their respective pricing, but both laptops feature strikingly similar designs and pack some powerful hardware in their stylish chassis. We compared the hardware and features of the Samsung Notebook 7 Force with Apple’s new MacBook Pro 15-inch laptop. The dimensions and chassis design of the Notebook 7 Force and new MacBook Pro are extremely similar, and both laptops can be outfitted with powerful graphics cards with up to 4GB of VRAM. The display on the Samsung Notebook 7 Force is slightly larger than the Macbook Pro’s screen, although the latter has a significantly higher resolution. While both devices can be fitted with Intel Core i7 chips, the MacBook Pro includes Intel’s 9th-generation chip while the Samsung device only has an 8th-generation processor. There is not much of a performance boost between the two generations in the Core i7 range however, and these chips remain relatively competitive. Below are the specifications of the Samsung Notebook 7 and the Apple MacBook Pro.  The specifications of these devices are similar in many aspects, including their potential graphics processing power and high-speed storage capabilities. Samsung’s Notebook 7 Force is considerably cheaper than the MacBook Pro, although the latter does include features which the Samsung device lacks. The new MacBook Pro 15-inch has a Touch Bar above the keyboard which can be customised to improve productivity or accessibility, and the device’s display has a much higher resolution than the Notebook 7 Force. The performance of the Notebook 7 Force might come close to the MacBook Pro’s – especially if the additional SSD slots are filled with high-speed drives – this difference in screen resolution might be a deal-breaker for some content creators. Samsung’s Notebook 7 Force runs Windows 10 while the Apple MacBook Pro runs macOS, and this would also be a major factor in determining which devices customers would be inclined to purchase. Apple fans may be comfortable with paying more for a MacBook Pro due to the familiarity and compatibility of the macOS operating system with their software and other devices. However, content creators on a budget and buyers looking for a cheaper MacBook Pro counterpart might find the NoteBook 7 Force’s cheaper price tag and wider selection of physical ports prefferable to the MacBook Pro. Samsung’s Notebook 7 Force will initially be available in Korea and Hong Kong, followed by the US and Brazil later in 2019.
