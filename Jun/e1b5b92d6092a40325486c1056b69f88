Samsung is planning to launch a new foldable smartphone with a clamshell design, according to Korean news website ETNews. The device will feature a 6.7-inch display which would fold along the centre, making it far more compact than the manufacturerâ€™s current Galaxy Fold smartphone. Both of the screens will be hidden when the smartphone is folded, and Samsung reportedly plans to include a one-inch display on the exterior of the device for facilitate notifications and calls. The report stated that Samsung is already manufacturing parts for the new device and is set to launch the foldable clamshell smartphone in 2020. The company is also expected to launch its Galaxy Fold smartphone to the public in the near future, following the rectification of a number of technical issues with the device.
