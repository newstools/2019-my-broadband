Microsoft has confirmed the existence of a bug which causes Windows 10 PCs using USB Type-C devices to shut down significantly slower than usual. Microsoft’s Philip Froese said on the company’s USB blog that a bug in the USB Type-C Connector System Software Interface (UCSI) implementation is the cause of many PCs suffering a 60-second delay in their sleep and shutdown processes. This delay happens if the USB Type-C device is busy handling a new connect or disconnect event when the user tries to turn off the computer. “Apart from the extra one minute the sleep or shutdown process takes in this circumstance, this bug does not affect normal functionality of USB Type-C on your machine,” said Froese. “The system and the USB Type-C ports should continue to function properly after the next wake or restart of the system.” This bug is present in Windows 10 version 1809, and has been resolved in the latest Windows 10 build – 1903. Microsoft advises users affected by the bug to update their operating system.
