Apple has written a letter to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer asking him to reconsider proposed tariffs on Chinese products, which it claims would “tilt the playing field” in favour of its global competitors. “The Chinese producers we compete with in global markets do not have a significant presence in the U.S. market, and so would not be impacted by U.S. tariffs,” said Apple. Apple added that it is the largest US corporate taxpayer to the country’s treasury, but tariffs would result in a reduction to its US economic contribution. Previous tariffs had affected minor Apple products such as chargers and cables, but expanded tariffs proposed in May would impose an additional 25% tariff on some of Apple’s most popular devices. Products that will be affected if the new tariffs are implemented include iPhones, MacBooks, iPads, Apple Watches, and iMacs.
