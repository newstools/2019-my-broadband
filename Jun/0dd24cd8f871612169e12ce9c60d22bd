Signify has launched a new range of LiFi systems, dubbed Trulifi, which includes the “world’s fastest and most reliable LiFi systems commercially available”. Instead of using radio signals, such as WiFi, 4G, or Bluetooth, Trulifi uses light waves to offer reliable and secure two-way wireless communications. This means that Trulifi can help to ease radio spectrum congestion and is particularly suitable for areas where Wi-Fi does not work well. Trulifi uses optical wireless transceiver technology built, or retrofitted, into Philips electric light units. A USB-access key plugged into a laptop is used to receive the LiFi signal and acts as an emitter to send data back to the light unit. The new range of Trulifi-enabled lights provide wireless connectivity at speeds up to 150Mbps over large spaces, such as meeting rooms and office floors. To ensure users maintain connectivity, there is seamless handover between each Trulifi-enabled, light enabling users to roam around. The Trulifi range also includes a fixed point-to-point system which acts like a wireless cable with speeds of up to 250 Mbps speed,. Potential applications for this product include machines in environments like industrial plants and hospitals, where RF communications may not be permitted.
