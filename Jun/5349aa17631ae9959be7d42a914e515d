Naspers has announced that its new global consumer Internet group, previously known as “NewCo”, will be called Prosus. The newly-named group will list on Euronext Amsterdam in September, in addition to an inward listing on the JSE. “Prosus is a Latin word, with various meanings. Its use in this case is inspired by the meaning ‘forwards’,” Naspers said in a statement. “Like Naspers, Prosus will be focused on forward momentum, continually striving to create value by building technology-led companies that improve people’s everyday lives.” The group will comprise a number of the company’s assets outside of South Africa, including investments across a variety of industries and the group’s 31.2% stake in Tencent.
