Microsoft has followed in the footsteps of Mozilla by testing a new anti-tracking feature for its new Chromium-based Edge browser. The new feature allows users to manage the level of data which third-party trackers are allowed to collect about their browsing habits. The feature is currently available in the latest Canary release, and can be tested by typing “edge://flags#edge-tracking-prevention” into the address bar of the browser. Once enabled, users will be able to choose from three levels of tracker blocking – Basic, Balanced, and Strict. The basic version of tracker blocking is designed to block malicious trackers, while scaling up to Strict will block almost all third-party trackers but may risk breaking certain websites. Microsoft previously demonstrated the feature at its Build 2019 event.
