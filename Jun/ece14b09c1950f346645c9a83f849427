The developer preview of Microsoft’s Chromium-based Edge browser is now available to download for Windows 7 and Windows 8, the company announced in a blog post. The preview builds for Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 are available through the Microsoft Edge Canary channel and can be downloaded from the Microsoft Edge Insider website. Microsoft said the features in the Windows 7 and Windows 8 version of the browser are largely similar to those in the Windows 10 version, and updates will be delivered to all versions of the application at the same time. The company encouraged testers to report any issues with the software through the “Send Feedback” tool found within the browser. “The first Canary builds do have a few known issues, including the lack of dark mode support and no support for AAD sign-in, which we are working to resolve soon,” Microsoft said.
