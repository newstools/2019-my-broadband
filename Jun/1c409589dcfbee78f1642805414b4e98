Smartphone technology has come a long way, but this technological growth has come a steep increase in cost. Flagship models of smartphones from the likes of Samsung and Apple now exceed the R30,000 mark – a figure that many are unwilling to pay. For those who simply want the basics that a smartphone provides, there are numerous options available on the South African market. Some of the best options are listed below. Pricing of these smartphones is from Vodacom. Huawei is well known for providing good-quality smartphones at an attractive price. The Y5 2019 is no exception, offering users surprisingly good features for under R2,000. What immediately stands out is the device’s 13MP primary camera, which means that you should be able to take high-quality photos. Other key features include 2GB RAM, 32GB storage, and a microSD slot. The Y5 2019 also looks like a phone worth significantly more than its actual price tag, featuring a tear-drop bezel for the front camera and a stylish design.  Hisense is a highly-competitive brand in the budget smartphone category. Its Infinity E8 offers some impressive specifications, including a 5.7-inch HD+ display. It also boasts a powerful, software-enhanced dual camera set-up, using a 13MP primary lens accompanied by a 2MP secondary camera. It also includes a 5MP front camera. The Infinity E8 offers 1GB RAM and up to 16GB storage space, combined with capacity for up to 128GB microSD storage.  The Mobicel Hype smartphone offers an impressive 1,440 x 720 IPS display. This combined with its 13MP camera makes that it is another great option for a budget smartphone. The Hype also offers a 5MP front camera, which is more than acceptable for a smartphone at this price. It only offers 8GB of internal storage, but this can be topped up with up to 128GB memory card storage.  Nokia has been in the smartphone game for decades, and offers a great device to those looking for a cheaper smartphone. The Nokia 2.1 features an 5.5-inch 1,280 x 720 display and an impressive 4,000mAh battery. It also supports up to 128GB microSD storage to complement its 8GB internal storage space. Its camera features an 8MP lens and includes auto-focus functionality.  The cheapest of the smartphones in this list is the Galaxy A2 Core, manufactured by smartphone market leader Samsung. It offers users a 960 x 540 LCD display and rund the lightweight Android 8.0 Go operating system. The A2 Core offers users two 5MP cameras – one at the front and one at the back.
