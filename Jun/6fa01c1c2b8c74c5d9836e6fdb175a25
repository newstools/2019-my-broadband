Sanral announced that it has revamped its mobile app to improve user experience and introduce new features. As part of the new app, registered e-toll account users will now be able to experience cashless parking. “The new parking feature, which is an opt-in service on the app, enables users to park at 34 different KaChing operated parking lots without the need for a paper ticket or cash,” said Sanral. It added that there are plans to partner with other parking providers to extend this service in the future. The app will also allow users to manage their toll accounts, tracking their monthly spending, and view frequent user discount offers. It was developed by Electronic Toll Collection (ETC), the company responsible for managing the Gauteng e-tolling system on behalf of Sanral. The new features of the Sanral app are outlined in the video below.
