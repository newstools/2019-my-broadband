Google suffered an outage across various cloud platforms yesterday, which caused users to experience reduced performance and intermittent errors. The company said that the issue primarily affected Google Cloud, G Suite, and YouTube, although other applications that rely on Google’s cloud structure such as Discord and Snapchat were also impacted. The issue, which primarily affected the eastern parts of the US, was resolved in the early hours of this morning. “We will conduct an internal investigation of this issue and make appropriate improvements to our systems to help prevent or minimize future recurrence,” said Google. The company added that it would publish a detailed report of what happened after concluding its internal investigation. Google has suffered several outages over the past few months, including a YouTube outage in October.
