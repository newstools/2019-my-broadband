Octotel announced that its fibre network has now reached more than 100,000 homes passed, making it the first independent fibre network operator to reach this milestone in the Cape. The fibre network is Cape Town’s largest open-access FTTH provider, and achieved this milestone only three years after it first began to roll out its infrastructure in Sea Point. Despite the company exclusively deploying its network in Cape Town, Octotel is the third-largest FTTH network behind Openserve and Vumatel. Octotel said it has now covered most of the city and surrounding suburbs and is aggressively passing an additional 4,000 homes each month as it expands its network. Octotel said that it has rolled out fibre to a number of suburbs over the past six months, including: “The growing demand for seamless fibre connectivity has seen us expand aggressively into many new areas,” said Octotel senior network architect Rory van Zyl. “Our vision is to grow our FTTH network to cover over 150,000 homes in Cape Town within the next year, a target that is now well within sight.” Octotel also said it is working with communities in its fibre coverage area to connect CCTV networks and provide free connectivity to local schools. “Octotel believes communities connected with high-speed fibre are not only safer, as next-generation security systems can be enabled, but also happier as today’s media and entertainment can only be accessed if a home is connected with fibre.”
