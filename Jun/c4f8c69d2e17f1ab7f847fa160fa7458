Huawei Western European President Vincent Pang told TechRadar that the company’s Mate X foldable smartphone will launch by no later than September. “It’s coming in September – at the latest,” said Pang. “Probably earlier, but definitely September is guaranteed.” The company had already announced a September release date, but Pang’s comments provided hope to prospective buyers that the launch could take place sooner than this. Huawei added that the reason for the delayed rollout is because of the slow launch of 5G, rather than its issues with the US. When asked where the Mate X would launch, Pang said that it would be available “anywhere with 5G.” Huawei SA has confirmed that the Mate X will be available in South Africa Pang also confirmed that the Mate X will run Android at launch despite Huawei’s US troubles, because the phone had already been unveiled before the ban was announced.
