Rain has partnered with Tymebank to test the distribution its SIM cards at Tyme kiosks, making it easier for its clients to sign up for a new service. Rain and Tymebank have a common shareholder, African Rainbow Capital, which means the two companies enjoy a strong collaborative relationship. Tymebank has a national network of manned Tyme kiosks at Pick n Pay and Boxer stores across South Africa, which is of value to Rain as a physical distribution network. Tyme kiosks personnel are already equipped to do FICA verification for banking clients, which means it is easy to add the RICA process at these kiosks. Rain CEO Willem Roos told MyBroadband that the RICA process is performed by the Tyme Ambassador manning the kiosk. “In due course we hope to have our eRICA process implemented at the kiosks, which would mean that Rain customers can follow a seamless process in most Pick n Pays and walk out connected,” he said. Roos explained that Rain hopes to scale the current distribution trial to most Tyme kiosks over the next few months. The documents below give an overview of the Rain and Tymebank partnership.
