Samsung South Africa announced today that its new 27-inch CRG5 gaming monitor will be coming to South Africa. The CRG5 is the latest addition to Samsung’s curved monitor range, offering gamers a 240Hz refresh rate panel with 4ms response time and G-Sync compatibility. The monitor features Full HD resolution and a 3000:1 contrast ratio, which Samsung said will result in deeper blacks and brighter whites. It will also offer gamers preset display options for various game genres, and will allow users to create up to three custom display profiles. “Samsung’s delivering next-level gaming experiences with innovative curved displays using the latest graphics technology to immerse gamers like never before,” said Samsung South Africa B2B head Reggie Nxumalo. “Combining a 240Hz refresh rate with Nvidia G-Sync compatibility in Samsung’s new CRG5 curved gaming monitor gives gamers advanced performance for the most graphic-intense games.” The CRG5 will launch globally in the third quarter of 2019, and Samsung South Africa has not yet announced local pricing for the device.
