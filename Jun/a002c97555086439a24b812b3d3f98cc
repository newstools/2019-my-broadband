Google has launched its fourth beta version of Android Q – its upcoming operating system. This version includes the final Android Q APIs, as well as the official SDK, meaning that developers can test their apps for compatibility with the new operating system. Google is also opening the option of publishing apps that are compiled against or through API 29 to the Play Store, meaning that developers can release updates to their apps on devices running the Android Q beta. Beyond this, there aren’t any significant new features – the primary goal of Beta 4 is instead to polish already-added features. The first Android Q beta was released in March, with a new version being released each consecutive month. These are the smartphones that are currently supported by Android Q Beta 4: For information on how to sign up for Android Q Beta 4 and install the OS on your device, visit the official Android website.
