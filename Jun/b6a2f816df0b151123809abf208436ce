An attempt to ship a Huawei P30 Pro to a recipient in the United States through FedEx was met with a refusal to deliver by the courier company. PCMag attempted to send a Huawei P30 Pro from London to its New York office through FedEx, but the company refused to deliver the smartphone, returning the package to London citing the ongoing conflict between the US government and Huawei. “Parcel returned by FedEx, due U.S. government issue with Huawei and China government [sic] ,” the notice on the returned package read. This action is a misinterpretation of the regulation around US companies doing business with Huawei due to its placement on the US Entity List, a fact acknowledged by FedEx in a statement supplied to PCMag: “The package in question was mistakenly returned to the shipper, and we apologize for this operational error,” FedEx said. “As a global company that moves 15 million shipments each day, we are committed to compliance with all rules and regulations and minimizing impact to our customers as we adjust our operations to comply with a dynamic US regulatory environment.” US delivery service UPS added that upon review of the relevant policies, it determined that there is nothing prohibiting the shipping of Huawei phone from the UK to the United States.
