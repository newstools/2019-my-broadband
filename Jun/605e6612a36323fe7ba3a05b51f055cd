Microsoft has banned the use of Slack Free, Slack Standard, and Slack Plus from its workplace, GeekWire reports. The company circulated a list of “prohibited and discouraged” software in an internal memo to employees, citing security issues with Slack as a reason for banning its use in the company. “Slack Free, Slack Standard and Slack Plus versions do not provide required controls to properly protect Microsoft Intellectual Property (IP),” Microsoft told its employees. “Existing users of these solutions should migrate chat history and files related to Microsoft business to Microsoft Teams, which offers the same features and integrated Office 365 apps, calling and meeting functionality.” Other banned platforms include Grammarly’s grammar checker and Kaspersky’s security software. Microsoft also discouraged the use of services such as AWS, Google Docs, PagerDuty, and GitHub by its employees.
