AMD has revealed its new Radeon Pro Vega II and Radeon Pro Vega II Duo graphics cards, which are aimed at the high-end professional market. The new GPUs are built to handle demanding workloads, including 3D rendering and 8K video editing, and they are built on AMD’s Vega 20 architecture using a 7nm manufacturing process. AMD’s Radeon Pro Vega II Duo graphics card is essentially two standard Radeon Pro Vega II GPUs packaged as a single chipset, combining the 4,096 stream processors and 32GB of HBM2 memory of each GPU to deliver 8,192 processors and 64GB HBM2 VRAM in a single graphics card. At its WWDC 2019 event, Apple announced that its new Mac Pro 2019 could be outfitted with a maximum of two AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo graphics cards, allowing the powerful machine to leverage four 7nm GPUs for the most demanding graphics workloads. “Today’s high-end professional content creation applications are driving an insatiable need for ever increasing levels of processing power and memory,” said Radeon corporate vice president Scott Herkelman. “Radeon Pro Vega II delivers outstanding performance, especially when DaVinci Resolve is put to work with 8K video footage combined with various filters.” Below are the specifications of the new Radeon Pro Vega II graphics cards. There is currently no pricing available for the hardware.
