Rain and Vodacom have a close commercial relationship – Rain has access to Vodacom’s sites and facilities while Vodacom roams on Rain’s new LTE-A network. It looks like a match made in heaven. The roaming agreement with Rain helps Vodacom to overcome its network capacity constraints while Vodacom helps Rain to rapidly roll out an LTE-A network. Many people may wonder why such an agreement did not happen sooner. Well, such an agreement did exist in the past and Vodacom was, in fact, a shareholder in the company which became Rain. The relationship between Vodacom and Wireless Business Solutions (WBS) – the company which ultimately became Rain – stretches back over a decade and included numerous twists and turns. What is interesting is that Vodacom struck a roaming agreement with Rain to get access to spectrum to increase their network capacity. This agreement is costing Vodacom billions and it is doing a great deal to help Rain roll out its network and make the most of its spectrum assets. What must sting is the fact that Vodacom previously owned a large share in WBS and had access to its spectrum. To get access to the same spectrum now, it has to fund a direct competitor. Here is an overview of how WBS started off, how the company launched its iBurst wireless service, how it became Rain, and Vodacom’s relationship with these companies.
