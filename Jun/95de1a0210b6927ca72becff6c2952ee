Avengers: Endgame will be re-released in cinemas with new footage which was not included in the original version. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige told Comicbook that Avengers: Endgame will arrive with additional scenes which were cut from the first theatrical release. Feige said the new version of Avengers: Endgame will be released next weekend ahead of Spider-Man: Far From Home’s release in July. He told Screen Rant that there will be “a deleted scene, a little tribute, and a few surprises” after the credits. To date Avengers: Endgame grossed $2.742 billion globally and is closing in on Avatar which holds the record on $2.787 billion. This re-release of Avengers: Endgame should ensure that it becomes the highest grossing movie of all time.
