Microsoft announced that it will add an AI-powered Present Coach feature to PowerPoint which will listen to you as you practice your presentations and give you tips on how to improve. Presenter Coach will call you out for swearing, highlight culturally insensitive content, and inform you if you are reading off your slides. The feature will also generate a complete report which will give you a complete breakdown on how good your presentation was, and provide tips for improvement. “Training and feedback are vital to help people gain confidence and improve their public speaking abilities, and Presenter Coach in PowerPoint has arrived to help you do just that,” said Microsoft. Microsoft also announced a feature that will take words you enter onto a slide and use them to find an optimal theme style, colours, and photographs for your presentation.
