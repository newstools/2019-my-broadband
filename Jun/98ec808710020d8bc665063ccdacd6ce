Dell has launched its Alienware Area-51M gaming laptop in South Africa, which it claims is the most powerful upgradeable gaming laptop in the world. The Area-51m sports a 17-inch display and ships with a variety of gaming features, including Tobii eye-tracking technology, high-end cooling technology, and Alienware Command Centre. Performance-wise, it offers gamers a 9th-generation octa-core desktop processor and 64GB of memory. Both of these are upgradeable, as are the laptop’s storage and graphics card. “Gamers have long complained about the limited lifespan of a gaming laptop due to an inability to swap out the graphics card once a more powerful model hits the market,” said Dell EMC Consumer Product Specialist Heinrich Pretorius. “Area-51m ensures that gamers’ hardware never goes out of date.” Pricing will range from R50,000 to R80,000 depending on configuration, and the Area-51m comes in two finishes – Dark Side of the Moon and Lunar Light.
