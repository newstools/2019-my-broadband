Microsoft has announced that its game streaming service, named Project xCloud, will arrive in October, Engadget reports. xCloud is Microsoft’s competitor for Google’s recently-unveiled Stadia game streaming service, which will run through YouTube’s video-streaming platform. Microsoft said that Xbox gamers will be able to stream games directly from their Xbox One console, rather than needing to stream through Microsoft’s servers. A previous announcement by Microsoft said that xCloud will support every title available on Xbox One, meaning it will offer over 3,500 games on the service. Microsoft has not provided any additional details or pricing for the service. The company also announced that it’s next-generation Xbox console will offer four-times the performance of the Xbox One X due to its AMD processor, which offers up to 120 FPS.
