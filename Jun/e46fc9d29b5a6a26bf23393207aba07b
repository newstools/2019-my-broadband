WeWork has announced that it will open its first office in Cape Town, as well as a second Johannesburg office in Sandton. The Cape Town office will comprise four floors in the 80 Strand Street office block, which is situated in the Cape Town CBD. It will be capable of housing over 590 members, and is set to open in the fourth quarter of this year. “We’re pleased to announce our expansion to Cape Town,” said Patrick Nelson, head of WeWork’s real estate department in EMEA. “Not only is it a flourishing city in terms of culture and opportunity, but for business, it’s a central point for entrepreneurs and large companies to be based.” The second Johannesburg office will be situated in West Street, and is also set to open in Q4 2019. It will be capable of hosting over 1,800 members. Nelson added that WeWork has seen great uptake since opening in South Africa. “Since announcing our expansion to South Africa, we’ve seen great interest from companies of all sizes, including Naspers, who will be moving into our first location in Johannesburg later this year,” he said.
