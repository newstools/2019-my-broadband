Apple is expected to replace the Lightning port on its next-generation iPhones with USB Type-C connectivity, SoftpediaÂ reports. Rumours that Apple would switch to USB Type-C first began circulating back in June 2018, before resurfacing in January 2019. New developments now appear to confirm this speculation. In the first beta of the recently-launched iOS 13, the iPhone recovery animation shows a USB-C connector rather than a Lightning cable. USB Type-C is the standard connection used across most smartphone brands, which would make it a more convenient connection type to have on an iPhone than the current Lightning port. Apple is expected to release three new iPhones in September which will replace the iPhone Xr, Xs, and Xs Max. Alongside the possible inclusion of USB-C ports, this iPhone range is rumoured to be the last to include models with LCD displays.
