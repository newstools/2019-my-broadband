Facebook is working on new Portal smart speaker hardware, the company told The Verge. The company’s vice president of augmented and virtual reality Andrew Bosworth said the company will unveil more Portal form factors later this year. “Hardware is coming to the home, and we want to make sure that human connection, connection between two people, is a first-party experience on that hardware,” he told The Verge. There is no official information regarding the upcoming Portal form factors, but there is speculation that the new Portal device could attach to the top of the user’s TV and connect to the screen as a display. The company first revealed its Portal and Portal+ smart speakers last year, both of which feature large displays and cameras to facilitate video calling.
