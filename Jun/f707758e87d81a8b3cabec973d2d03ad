Chinese smartphone manufacturer Oppo has teased a new solution for combining a front-facing camera with a bezel-less display. The company tweeted a video of a functioning camera sensor which rests underneath a bezel-less OLED display. This solution could remove the need for notches at the top of smartphone displays which house front-facing cameras, as well as mechanical pop-up selfie cameras. Oppo has experimented with various solutions to the problem of pairing bezel-less displays with selfie cameras, and its bezel-less Find X smartphone overcame this problem with a pop-up sliding camera. In a Weibo post, Oppo vice president Brian Shen said this technology was still in its early stages, implying it would be a while before it could be implemented on commercial devices. https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1135393369113280512
