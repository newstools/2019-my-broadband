The 2019 MyBroadband Cloud Conference took place at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, yesterday, and thanks to our trusted streaming partner Antfarm, those who weren’t able to attend had the opportunity to watch it live. Antfarm specialises in live digital content delivery on any platform and to any device in the world. They’ve been pioneering and leading streaming technologies and solutions in Southern Africa since 2002, and have recently achieved a new level in B-BBEE following a recent shareholding transaction. The company’s newly constituted board is led by Pilisiwe Twala-Tau who represents the Toti Capital shareholding interest. Because of the transaction, Antfarm is now 51% black-owned and therefore a Level 2 B-BBEE contributor. Together with Antfarm’s other new shareholder, Broadsmart, the team is working towards more streaming innovation and helping their clients reach new audiences and communities. Antfarm is also the primary distributor of Epiphan products in Southern Africa, and can therefore assist clients with all their streaming needs – from full webcasting productions, to radio streaming and video management platforms.
