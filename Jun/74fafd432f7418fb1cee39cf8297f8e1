Newegg, the online retailer known for its great deals on PC hardware and gadgets, is shipping directly to South Africa. As spotted by MyBroadband readers, there is now an option to set South Africa as your location on the global Newegg website. When tested by MyBroadband, a range of PC hardware was on offer with its pricing in South African rand. Using the example of a 250GB 2.5-inch SATA SSD, which was over 50% off according to its listing, Newegg shows users the item price, the estimated delivery costs, and the estimated duties and VAT you will pay before checking out. In the case of the 250GB SSD, this took the item from R447.99 to R783.95, taking all listed costs into account. The estimated delivery time to South Africa was 3-5 business days, using the standard shipping option. Express shipping, which was R130 more, was set to take 2-3 business days. The costs are shown in the screenshots of the website purchase below.
