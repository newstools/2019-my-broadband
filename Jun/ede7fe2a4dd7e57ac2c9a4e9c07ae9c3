Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin has partnered with From Software to create a new action-RPG named Elden Ring. From Software, known for popular games such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and the Dark Souls series, announced the game at Microsoft’s E3 presentation yesterday. “Set in a vast, fully fledged fantasy world, players will be able to explore, overcome danger looming at every turn, and enjoy a wide variety of RPG experiences,” said From Software. The game will be published by From Software in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment in other countries. It will be available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, but no release date has been revealed yet.
