The United States will require nearly all applicants for visas to disclose their social media accounts to the US, the BBC reported. The US State Department’s new regulations require applicants to provide all social media account names as well as all email addresses and phone numbers owned within the past five years. Only a selection of diplomats and officials will not be required to submit these details. “We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes to protect US citizens, while supporting legitimate travel to the United States,” the US State Department said. These rules were first proposed in March 2018, but the American Civil Liberties Union has claimed that such social media monitoring is not “effective or fair.” Trump reportedly wants high-level vetting to take place on all entering the country as part of his crackdown on US immigration policies.
