Microsoft and Intel have both confirmed that they will continue to provide software and security updates to customers who own Huawei devices, PCWorld reports. Microsoft previously pulled all Huawei computers from its online store, but then proceeded to reverse this decision – explaining that after evaluating the situation, they had come to the conclusion that they were allowed to sell these devices. Now, Microsoft claims that to its best understanding, the blacklisting of Huawei by the United States does not forbid it from providing updates to Huawei device currently in circulation. “Our initial evaluation of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision on Huawei has indicated we may continue to offer Microsoft software updates to customers with Huawei devices,” said Microsoft. Intel has also reportedly confirmed that it will continue to provide security and driver updates to those who use its Intel chips in Huawei devices. This is further good news for Huawei users, after Huawei South Africa CBG general manager Likun Zhao recently told MyBroadband that all existing products will continue to receive support from Google.
