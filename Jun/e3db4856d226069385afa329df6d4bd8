Game developer Bungie has announced that it will offer a free version of Destiny 2, including all its foundational modes, activities, and rewards. Destiny 2: New Light will be available on all of the full game’s current platforms and will include both the original campaign and the first year of updates. “One of our goals for this year is to make it simpler for new players to join this amazing community and quickly play alongside our veteran Guardians,” said Bungie. Bungie also announced that Destiny 2 will be moving from Battle.net to Steam on PC. Players will have all their progress and purchases transferred between the two platforms. Destiny 2: New Light will launch on 17 September, and this will also be the date when the PC version of the game becomes available on Steam. The game will also become available on Google Stadia, Google’s new streaming platform, in the final quarter of 2019, said Bungie.
