The SA Post Office has warned that there is a rise in the number of international parcels that cannot be dispatched by air mail as they contain items which are classified as unsafe for air cargo. “Regulations regarding the transport of items as air cargo have been tightened,” the SA Post Office said. The new regulations mean that no substance that could possibly combust, explode, or leak in transit may be posted. All outgoing mailbags are scanned for items not allowed as air cargo, and all bags contained banned items are returned after being screened. “Customers are therefore requested not to include such items in parcels they send abroad,” the SA Post Office said. The SA Post Office has provided guidelines of items which may not be shipped via airmail, which include: The SA Post Office advised South Africans to make sure their parcels are packaged securely, as they are transported in bulk. “If your mail item does not fill the container, fill it with packaging material like shredded paper or polystyrene to act as a shock absorber,” the Post Office said. It added that the maximum weight of a parcel is 30kg. “When ordering an item from abroad, ask the sender to put your cell-phone number on the parcel. That way you can be notified by SMS when the parcel is ready for collection,” it said.
