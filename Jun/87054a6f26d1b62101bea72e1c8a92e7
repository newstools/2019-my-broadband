One of the hitmen who tried to kill SABC chief audit executive Thami Zikode told him and the police that they were not after his car. On Friday night, four attackers followed Zikode home after he left his SABC office in Auckland Park and tried to kill him in front of his home. “When he got to the gate of his house, the occupants of the car started shooting at his car,” the SABC said. The matter was reported to the police for further investigation and one of the suspects has been arrested. This suspect was injured when Zikode shot back during the attack. The other three suspects fled the scene. The SABC said a firearm was recovered at the scene and the getaway car was later found near Southgate in Johannesburg. The City Press reported that the suspect told Zikode and later the police that they were not after his car, which ruled out hijacking as the motive. According to the report the alleged hitman confirmed that it was an assassination attempt. A witness at the scene said the hitman told him they were sent by “one lady”. “Zikode was unharmed and remains fully committed to ensuring good governance within the Corporation,” the SABC said in a statement. The City Press reported that SABC staff were not surprised by the attack as the report contained the names of numerous suspects and others being investigated. Many of the people who were named in the audit reports are now cooperating with the Hawks investigation. The police investigation is now trying to establish which aspects of Zikode’s work the hit could be associated with.
