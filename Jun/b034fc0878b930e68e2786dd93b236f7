Leaked renders of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10 smartphone have been posted online, providing the first look at the upcoming smartphone. The leaked photos were published by 91mobiles, and show that the Note 10 will retain the Infinity O display design featured on the Galaxy S10 series. The circular cut-out for the front-facing camera will now be placed in the centre of the screen’s top edge, and the display itself is a 6.3-inch AMOLED panel which curves around the side of the device. Samsung has removed the headphone jack from the Galaxy Note 10 along with the dedicated Bixby button, and it has implemented a vertical triple-camera system on the back of the smartphone. Other features on the Galaxy Note 10 include Samsung’s latest S-Pen model and an in-display fingerprint sensor. The device is expected to launch in August 2019.
