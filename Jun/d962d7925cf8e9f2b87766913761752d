MyBroadband recently tested the mobile network quality in KwaZulu-Natal as part of its countrywide mobile network testing project. The MyBroadband mobile network testing project is conducted in partnership with Afristay and Huawei Mobile Devices, and provides a comprehensive look at cellular network quality in South Africa. Coverage and data throughput tests are conducted using the MyBroadband Speed Test App running on Huawei Mate 20 Pro smartphones — the world’s first phone to support Cat. 21 LTE connections. A SIM from Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom, and Rain was installed in each of our test devices, and performance tests were conducted at regular intervals while driving. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure an impartial testing environment. One of our test routes was via the R34 to Newcastle and Richard’s Bay, down to Durban, then back to Johannesburg along the N3. Thousands of speed tests were conducted along the route and in the towns we passed. Averages for each network’s download speed, upload speed, and latency are calculated for an area, then combined into a Network Quality Score out of 10. Each of the these three averages are normalised, then weighted according to importance. The weights for each of these key network performance indicators were derived from the results of a MyBroadband survey. The survey asked IT professionals how they rate the importance of download speed, upload speed, and latency when choosing a mobile data connection. Understanding the maps below: Each of the red dots indicate a test in that area. Larger red dots indicate multiple tests in the area. MTN had the best mobile data network in Richard’s Bay, followed by Rain and Telkom. MTN had the best average download speed (33.9Mbps) and upload speed (15.6Mbps). Only Rain’s network had slightly better average latency than MTN’s — 33ms vs 35ms. While Rain and Telkom did outperform Cell C and Vodacom, it should be noted that the two smaller networks have a much smaller coverage footprint — half (or less) than that of Vodacom or Cell C. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-311063" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Richards-Bay.jpg" alt="Richards Bay Mobile Network Quality test map and score summary" width="640" height="802" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Richards-Bay.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Richards-Bay-319x400.jpg 319w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Richards-Bay-768x962.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Richards-Bay-343x430.jpg 343w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The results in Mtunzini, a much smaller town nearby to Richard’s Bay, were very similar. However, in this instance Vodacom (18Mbps) managed much faster download speeds than Cell C (11.5Mbps). Telkom had the same average download speed as Vodacom in Mtunzini, but beat it on upload speed — 8.6Mbps vs. 3.5Mbps. Rain had faster download speeds than Telkom, but slower upload speeds, resulting in a dead heat between the two networks. MTN comfortably took first place with an average download speed of 26.6Mbps, upload speed of 9.5Mbps, and latency of 26ms. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-311061" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mtunzini.jpg" alt="Mtunzini Mobile Network Quality test map and score summary" width="640" height="811" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mtunzini.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mtunzini-316x400.jpg 316w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mtunzini-768x973.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mtunzini-339x430.jpg 339w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While Vodacom and MTN both offer great coverage in Pietermaritzburg, MTN had the best overall network quality. MTN achieved higher download and upload speeds, 72.7Mbps and 21.9Mbps, compared to Vodacom’s 63.3Mbps and 18.6Mbps. Vodacom’s data network had the lowest average latency of 29ms. MTN’s 33ms average latency came in third to Rain’s 32ms. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-311007" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pietermaritzburg.jpg" alt="Map and network quality scores summary for Pietermaritzburg — Q2 2019" width="640" height="800" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pietermaritzburg.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pietermaritzburg-320x400.jpg 320w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pietermaritzburg-768x960.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pietermaritzburg-344x430.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Thanks to our project partner Afristay, we stayed in comfort while testing the cellular networks in Richard’s Bay, Mtunzini, Pietermaritzburg, and Durban. We stayed at Oliver’s the last time we were passing through the area to test KZN’s cellular networks, and enjoyed it so much we had to go back when we drove through Mtunzini again. As before, the service was excellent, the room beautiful and spacious, and the breakfast delicious. If you’re ever in the area, it’s worth visiting Oliver’s if only to pick up some of the amazing home-made sauces crafted by its manager, Sarina. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265643" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Olivers-Mtunzini.jpg" alt="Oliver's Bed and Breakfast Mtunzini" width="625" height="440" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Olivers-Mtunzini.jpg 625w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Olivers-Mtunzini-568x400.jpg 568w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Olivers-Mtunzini-611x430.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Greenlands offers spacious rooms, delicious breakfast, and solid Wi-Fi — a great feature for business travellers that want to give their mobile data connections a break. However, for us, the greatest treat of all were the two Stafford terriers who made up the welcoming committee. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310549" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Greenlands-BnB-Pietermaritzburg.jpg" alt="Greenlands B&amp;B, Pietermaritzburg gardens and main building" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Greenlands-BnB-Pietermaritzburg.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Greenlands-BnB-Pietermaritzburg-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Greenlands-BnB-Pietermaritzburg-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Located in Glen Ashley, a stone’s throw away from Umhlanga, Sanchia had comfortable rooms, served a good breakfast every morning, and tried to accommodate our requests as best they could. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-311047" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sanchia-Luxury-Guest-House.jpg" alt="Front of Sancia Luxury Guest House" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sanchia-Luxury-Guest-House.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sanchia-Luxury-Guest-House-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sanchia-Luxury-Guest-House-597x400.jpg 597w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Article title image by Vasiliy Meshko.
