Cell has launched its new WhatsApp Boosta bundle, a promotional offering that provides customers with additional WhatsApp-only data when they recharge. The WhatsApp Boosta option can be purchased every time a customer purchases a qualifying 1, 5, or 30-day data bundle. “WhatsApp is one of the biggest social media platforms in South Africa and to maintain an affordable yet seamless user experience on our network, we need to constantly innovate,” said Junaid Munshi, Chief Commercial Officer at Cell C. “WhatsApp has garnered a global appeal from a range of consumers and this promotion caters to all those customer segments,” Cell C added. The deal is available to all Cell C prepaid, postpaid, and hybrid customers, and will run until 31 August 2019.
