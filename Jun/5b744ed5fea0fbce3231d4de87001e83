NASA’s project to send more astronauts to the Moon is likely to suffer more delays and surge further over budget, The Verge reported. The two rockets that NASA has been developing to send astronauts to the Moon were both expected to launch in 2017, but delays have meant that NASA now only expects to launch in June 2020. NASA also claimed that these delays are the reason for the project’s financial issues, which have resulted in the endeavour costing around $1 billion more than was originally planned. A new report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) claims that the increase in costs to the project is closer to $1.8 billion, and that the launch is unlikely to happen until June 2021. The GAO claims that the reason for NASA’s lower estimate of how far it has gone over budget is that the space agency has been moving some costs to further projects. The last time US astronauts visited the Moon was the Apollo 17 landing in 1972.
