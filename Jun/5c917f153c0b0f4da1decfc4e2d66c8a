Apple is planning to launching a 6.7-inch iPhone Xs Max successor next year, which would be the largest iPhone ever sold, iPhone Hacks reported. The report, which is based on well-reputed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s latest research note, claims that this upcoming 6.7-inch iPhone will be joined by a 6.1-inch replacement for the iPhone Xr, and a smaller 5.45-inch iPhone Xs successor. This 5.45-inch iPhone will be a welcome addition to the range for iPhone users who have been asking for a new device similar to the iPhone SE. The 6.7-inch and 5.45-inch iPhone variants will reportedly offer 5G connectivity powered by a Qualcomm 5G modem and Samsung networking technology. Further reports indicate that all new iPhones will feature 5G in 2021, while Apple hopes to have its self-developed 5G modem ready as soon as 2022 – reducing its reliance on Qualcomm and Samsung.
