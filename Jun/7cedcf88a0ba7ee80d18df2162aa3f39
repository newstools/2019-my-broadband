The U.S. asked the World Trade Organization to suspend its dispute over China’s intellectual property practices for six months, according to a notice published Friday on the WTO website. The move will pause until Dec. 31 an investigation requested by the U.S. that says various Chinese regulations violate the WTO’s intellectual property rules. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The dispute was one of the first salvos in the U.S.-China trade war and came prior to President Donald Trump’s decision to impose unilateral tariffs on Chinese exports in response to the nation’s alleged theft of U.S. technology secrets and forced technology transfer policies. The U.S. complaint alleged that China “appears to be breaking WTO rules by denying foreign patent holders, including U.S. companies, basic patent rights to stop a Chinese entity from using the technology after a licensing contract ends.”
