Codehesion is one of South Africa’s top Android and iOS app development companies, and makes it quick and easy for businesses to get their own mobile app. With a 100% success rate and a long list of successful Android and iOS app projects under its belt, Codehesion provides unmatched customer service to its clients. Codehesion’s ability to complete projects faster and more affordably than its competitors has also helped it to show rapid growth this year. To support this growth, Codehesion recently strengthened its Android app and web development teams, with additional experienced developers joining the company. Codehesion CEO Hector Beyers said these additional resources will help them to roll out more world-class apps and websites without compromising on quality or deadlines. “We are very proud of our 100% success rate, which shows the power of our simple 4-step consultation and software development process,” said Beyers. “Our processes allow us to move from a company showing an interest in our services to starting with the project within a week, which is unrivalled in South Africa,” he said. Beyers encouraged companies who are looking to build an Android or iOS app to contact Codehesion for a free consultation. For a risk-free discussion about your project, visit Codehesion’s website.
