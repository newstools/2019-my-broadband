South Africa’s economy contracted the most in a decade in the first quarter as the nation suffered the deepest power outages since 2008. The rand dropped and banking shares slumped. The annualized decline in gross domestic product was 3.2% in the first quarter from a 1.4% expansion in the prior three months, Statistics South Africa said Tuesday. That compared with a median estimate for a contraction of 1.6%. The rand weakened as much as 1.4% against the dollar after the data was released, while the banking index fell 3.7%, the most since December.
