Microsoft has re-listed Huawei laptops on its online store, making the devices available for purchase once again. Last month, Huawei laptops disappeared from the Microsoft Store following the placement of the Chinese company on the US Entity List. Laptops including the MateBook X Pro, MateBook D, and the MateBook 13 are now listed again and available to purchase online from Microsoft. The company did not issue a statement regarding the initial de-listing, but a spokesperson has confirmed to The Verge that the company is now selling Huawei laptops again. “We have been evaluating, and will continue to respond to, the many business, technical and regulatory complexities stemming from the recent addition of Huawei to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations Entity List,” Microsoft said. “As a result, we are resuming the sale of existing inventory of Huawei devices at Microsoft Store.”
