South Africa will grow to become the cloud infrastructure hub for the entirety of Sub-Saharan Africa, according to Teraco MD Jan Hnizdo. Speaking at the 2019 MyBroadband Cloud Conference, Hnizdo said that public cloud infrastructure in South Africa would serve content to our African neighbours over the next six to seven years. “Public cloud infrastructure for Sub-Saharan Africa is going to be located here in South Africa for the next six to seven years,” Hnizdo said. “Microsoft Azure has already deployed its data centres here, AWS said it would deploy infrastructure, and Huawei has launched a local data centre, too.” “The reason we feel this is because we have a massive economy, we have a huge financial service industry, and all of these big enterprises want to go onto the cloud,” Hnizdo said. “All of our neighbouring countries and South Africa combined create quite a large addressable market for cloud providers.” The second reason for this projection is latency, as other African countries would rather link to public cloud servers in South Africa with minimal latency than continue sourcing content from Europe. Lastly, the reliability of Eskom also plays a factor, Hnizdo said. While we have between 100-200 hours of power outages per year, this is still far more reliable than our neighbouring countries. “Over the course of the next three to four years, we will be servicing all the content requirements of our neighbours,” Hnizdo said. He added that this change would have various other effects, such as terrestrial fibre growth and a change in the direction of data travel.
