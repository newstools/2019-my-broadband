Apple unveiled a new dedicated operating system for its iPad devices at WWDC 2019 named iPadOS. iPadOS features a redesigned user interface which allows users to pin widgets directly to their home screen. The operating system also makes use of the iPad’s bigger screen with improved multi-tasking capabilities and multi-window support for selected applications. Using the mail app on iPad is now more similar to using a standard desktop mail client, and the file browser has also been overhauled to improve navigation. iPadOS now allows users to connect an external USB drive and access files through the operating system, as well as iCloud drive folder sharing. Apple announced that iPadOS will feature an overhauled Safari browser which delivers desktop-class browsing. The new Safari browser for iPadOS automatically optimises web pages for the iPad’s large display and touch input, and the browser now includes a built-in download manager. Apple has also improved its Pencil functionality with iPadOS, lowering the latency of the Pencil to 9ms and implementing an overhauled tool set for greater functionality. iPadOS is built on the basic functionality of iOS 13, but has been redesigned to improve the iPad user experience, delivering a desktop-class interface and optimised browsing functionality.
