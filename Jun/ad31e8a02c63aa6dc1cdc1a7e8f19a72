Industry insiders have revealed that billions in airtime has been stolen from mobile subscribers in South Africa over the last decade. Cell C explained that, unlike some other networks, airtime theft on its network is minimal based on its processes – active monitoring and double opt-in – which are acted upon immediately with corrective actions. Despite these measures, fraudulent subscriptions continue to occur because rogue WASPs continue to find and exploit weaknesses in the system to bill people’s accounts. The Wireless Application Service Providers’ Association (WASPA), which regulates the industry, told MyBroadband that local mobile users are most at risk from overseas-based mobile fraudsters. WASPA said South African mobile users should be proactive about their mobile subscription services by following the steps below. Cell C makes it easy for subscribers to stop WASP billing and prevent future billing through the service below. This service allows you to block WASP billing and gives you the power to open your account to WASP billing if you want.
