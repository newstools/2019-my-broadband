Google has quietly started rolling out channel memberships for YouTube in South Africa, allowing users to support creators by signing up to donate R39.99 per month to their favourite channels. Channel memberships started rolling out last year for $4.99 per month after being tested on YouTube’s Gaming platform. “With Channel Memberships, viewers pay a monthly recurring fee… to get unique badges, new emoji, Members-only posts in the Community tab, and access to unique custom perks offered by creators, such as exclusive livestreams, extra videos, or shout-outs,” said YouTube chief product officer Neal Mohan. Google merged YouTube Gaming into the main YouTube service at the end of May. YouTube channel memberships use the existing payment information stored in your Google account. Supported payment cards include Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. The screenshots below illustrate how to “Join” and cancel your R39.99 per month membership to channels that have the feature enabled. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-311703" style="border: 1px solid
