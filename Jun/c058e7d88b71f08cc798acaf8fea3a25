President Cyril Ramaphosa recently announced at his State of the Nation address that the government will ensure that data costs are cut. “To provide impetus to this process, within the next month, the Minister of Communications will issue the policy direction to ICASA to commence the spectrum licensing process,” said Ramaphosa. In the interim, South Africans must contend with high data costs, which Ramaphosa claimed are holding back economic development in the country. MyBroadband recently compared SIM-only data contracts across South Africa’s leading mobile networks. However, many South Africans either can’t commit to a monthly data contract, or prefer not to. Once-off data bundles are the alternative for prepaid users, but this way of buying data can be significantly more expensive than a long-term contract. MyBroadband has compared the cost of recharging with a once-off data bundle with South Africa’s leading mobile networks. We used the following resources to acquire these prices: Below is the pricing of these once-off mobile data deals, along with any inclusive bonus data.
