Apple has unveiled its new watchOS 6 operating system for its Apple Watch devices. The new operating system includes a selection of new watch faces, activity trends, new applications, and its own App Store app. New watch faces included in watchOS 6 include gradient, large numerals, California dial, and a new solar face which visualises the sunâ€™s 24-hour path throughout the day. WatchOS 6 will also include chimes which play a small notification every hour and a number of new applications, including Audiobooks, Voice Memos, and Calculator. Apple is also bringing the App Store to Apple Watch, allowing users to browse and install applications directly from their Watch interface. Developers can create apps which run independently on Apple Watches running watchOS 6, removing the need for an iPhone companion app. WatchOS 6 will have a number of new health and fitness capabilities, including an activity trends interface which measures and compares nine key metrics over time. The operating system also supports new functionality which allows users to track their menstrual cycles and be warned when noise around them is loud enough to damage their hearing. Other new features coming in watchOS 6 include dynamic smart replies, Shazam with Siri, and spoken navigation with Maps.
