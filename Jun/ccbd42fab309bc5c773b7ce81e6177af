Speaking at the 2019 MyBroadband Cloud Conference, Schneider Electric Regional Executive Derek Friend stressed the importance of edge computing in the cloud environment. “The edge is closer than we think,” Friend said. He added that edge computing is becoming increasingly important, with Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix deploying edge infrastructure in various markets to improve latency. “It is a paradigm shift between power and latency,” he said. Friend also said that Schneider Electric places a major priority on modernising ageing data centres with a focus on improving hardware efficiency at the edge. “What we are aiming to do is to go back into the data centre environment and make it a greener solution,” he said. “We need to make that machinery smarter by deploying IoT solutions to edge hardware. This lets us monitor the data centre environment and free up more time for the data centre manager.”
