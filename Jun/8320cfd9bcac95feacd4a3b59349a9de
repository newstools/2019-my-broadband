Elon Musk announced at E3 on Thursday that Fallout Shelter is coming to Tesla’s vehicle operating system. The game will be joined by a variety of classic Atari games, as well as Cuphead and Beach Buggy Racing 2. To play the latter, Tesla owners will be able to use their Tesla car’s steering wheel to control their in-game vehicle. Tesla’s in-vehicle gaming system will also support both PlayStation 4 and Xbox controllers. Musk added that Tesla’s entertainment systems will also allow users to watch video-on-demand services such as Netflix and YouTube. To play these games and watch this content, the Tesla vehicle will have to be kept in park mode and for further safety reasons, racing games will not use the accelerator. Musk did not provide a launch date for these games.
