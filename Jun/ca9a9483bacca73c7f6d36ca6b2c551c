YouTube is implementing changes in its Android and iOS apps that will give users increased control over what appears on their YouTube homepage and “Up Next” list. One new feature that will be included is the ability to manually explore specific topics and videos related to those you’ve been watching. This is done through a series of small tabs which recommend topics to users based on what they have been watching on YouTube. This functionality will initially be launched for the Android app, but will be available to iOS and desktop versions of YouTube soon. Another upcoming feature is the ability to tell YouTube when you don’t want to watch certain types of videos. To do this, users will simply need to tap the three-dot menu next to the video title and select “Don’t recommend channel”. YouTube will also be offering more insight into why it is showing you certain videos or channels. Google said that all of these YouTube features will roll out in the coming days.
