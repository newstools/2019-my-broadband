Samsung plans to launch its upcoming Galaxy Note 10 premium smartphone on 7 August 2019, CNET reports. Sources familiar with the companyâ€™s plan said the new device would be launched at an Unpacked event at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn, New York. Leaked renders of the upcoming Galaxy Note 10 show that it could retain the Infinity O display design first introduced on the Galaxy S10 series. The renders also show that Samsung could remove the headphone jack from the Galaxy Note 10 along with the dedicated Bixby button, and it has implemented a vertical triple-camera system on the back of the smartphone. Two Galaxy Note 10 models are expected to be launched this year, with one device featuring a 6.3-inch display and the smaller handset sporting a 5.3-inch screen.
