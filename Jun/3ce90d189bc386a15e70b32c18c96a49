Google will no longer make tablet devices and will focus instead on other hardware like laptops, Computer World reports. The Pixel Slate – which is Google’s most recent tablet product – will continue to receive software updates, but it will cease to be manufactured and will not have a successor. “For Google’s first-party hardware efforts, we’ll be focusing on Chrome OS laptops and will continue to support Pixel Slate,” Google said in a statement. This was confirmed by Senior VP for Devices and Services, Rick Osterloh, in a tweet. “Hey, it’s true…Google’s HARDWARE team will be solely focused on building laptops moving forward, but make no mistake, Android & Chrome OS teams are 100% committed for the long-run on working with our partners on tablets for all segments of the market,” said Osterloh.
