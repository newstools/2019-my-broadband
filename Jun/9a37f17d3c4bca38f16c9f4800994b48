The ANC’s parliamentary caucus has nominated former communications minister Faith Muthambi to become the new chairperson of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice. This is according to Rapport, which said the ANC’s top six will now have to decide whether Muthambi will get the position. Muthambi is well-known for supporting former SABC chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng who wrecked the state broadcaster. She was also implicated in sending confidential cabinet information to the Gupta family which helped them to influence government decisions. Muthambi shot to fame when she was appointed as communications minister by former President Jacob Zuma on 25 May 2014. Before joining Zuma’s cabinet in 2014 she held various political positions, which included: She was also one of the seven ANC MPs who were nominated for the ad hoc committee to consider President Jacob Zuma‘s submissions on the public protector’s report on his Nkandla home. While serving as Makhado Municipal Manager, Muthambi was arrested for fraud by the Serious Economic Crime Unit from Polokwane in 2005. The fraud charge was laid against her by council members and officials who alleged that Muthambi had defrauded the council and Mercurius Motors when purchasing a German sedan. The court later withdrew the fraud charge brought against her, which she said was “not based on facts and nothing more than a lie”. The Gupta leaks revealed that Muthambi had sent confidential information from Cabinet meetings to Tony Gupta. Former Icasa acting chairwoman Vuyo Batyi also alleged that Muthambi put pressure on her to approve a Gupta bid for a free-to-air 24-hour news channel. A report by Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) highlighted the wrongdoings of Muthambi and the organisation laid treason charges against the former communications minister. Various members of parliament, including ANC MP Lerumo Kalako and DA MP Phumzile van Damme, wanted Muthambi to go to prison for her actions.
