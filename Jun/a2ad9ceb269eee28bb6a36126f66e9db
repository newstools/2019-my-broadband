AfriForum has declared a dispute with MultiChoice regarding “the inconsistent application of this television company’s political policy”. In April, MultiChoice said it would not carry content that includes Steve Hofmeyr on any of its platforms as his views were “not aligned with MultiChoice’s values”. “We welcome a society where freedom of speech is celebrated, however we take a stand against racism,” said MultiChoice Group Executive Corporate Affairs, Joe Heshu. AfriForum said MultiChoice has the right to implement policies against racism and divisive statements, but questioned how this policy has been applied. The organisation argues that no action has been taken against other artists who actively encourage violence and racial hatred against minorities on social media. Afriforum highlighted comments made by a presenter of a show on DStv, which include: With all the whites assaulting blacks..does it make it fairground to go on a white beating spree? Beat them bonke man, woman or child? There is no such thing as White Excellence…only thing whites are excellent at is stealing and copying. When you learn the history of Afrika…….and it’s indigenous people. The people who actually BELONG here. You know in other African countries whites were escorted to the their ships. One day that’s gonna happen here too Don’t ever forget: WHITES LIE! AfriForum demanded that MultiChoice either revise its political policy or apply it consistently. MultiChoice was asked for comment about the AfriForum dispute, but the company did not respond by the time of publication.
