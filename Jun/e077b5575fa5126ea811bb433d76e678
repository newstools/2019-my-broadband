Standard Bank has announced that it is closing a number of branches across South Africa, according to the company’s website. The bank said that this move is aimed at aligning its business and retail banking platforms with the modern way its users bank. While several branches in each province will be closed, Standard Bank said that its digital self-service channels will remain available at all times. The bank has closed numerous branches in each province, with Gauteng being the most heavily-affected followed by the Western Cape. “We know that the way you bank has changed and we’re changing with you,” Standard Bank said. “We’re aligning our retail and business banking services so that you can bank at any time, from anywhere. In the process of making these changes, we will be closing several branches.” Below is the full list of Standard Bank brances being closed in each province.
