Universum South Africa released the findings of its annual rankings survey, which revealed that Google is the most sought-after company to work for. The survey included 23,000 working professionals and 45,000 students who shared their opinions and views on career goals and ideal employers. “The tough economic, political and social landscape has had a major impact with both target groups prioritising security and stability from employers,” Universum SA country manager Keshia Serage said. She said South Africans are heavily focused on whether the employers they work for have what it takes to survive the current tough economic conditions. The survey results revealed that over half of young South African professionals are unhappy in their jobs and are looking to change employers within the next 12 months. Serage said with an average job satisfaction level of 60%, it highlights a need for employers to engage with their young employees. On average, she said, employees change jobs within the first two years of employment. “This means the employer carries the training and development costs to the benefit of other organisations,” said Serage.
