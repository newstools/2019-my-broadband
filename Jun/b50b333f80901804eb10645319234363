AMD is preparing to launch a 64-core, 128-thread Threadripper processor, WCCFTech reported. This would double the core-count of the largest High-End Desktop (HEDT) processor currently in circulation – AMD’s own 32-core W2990X. The report said that this processor is currently known as the X599, but this name is likely to change to avoid a convention clash with Intel’s HEDT processors. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the X599 will be compatible with existing TR4 motherboards, claims the report. It is unclear whether the X599 will use 14nm or 7nm technology. The price for this processor is expected to reach close to $3,000, and it will launch in the fourth quarter of 2019 – a date that AMD is reportedly committed to because it has “something else planned” for CES next year.
