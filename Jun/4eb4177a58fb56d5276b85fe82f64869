iOS 13 and iPadOS will both support USB and Bluetooth mouse devices, but this functionality is designed as an accessibility option rather than a fully-fledged feature. Developer Steve Troughton-Smith confirmed this in a tweet, showing that the feature can be found in the accessibility tab within the settings menu. Troughton-Smith also posted a video showing how the feature works, adding that it also works with a Magic Trackpad. “It doesn’t seem like mouse on iOS 13 spans external displays, even if you’re using an app that can display UI on an external display — the mouse cursor is locked to the iPad screen,” said Troughton-Smith. “It also doesn’t map right-click to the new context menus in iOS 13, but it does do scroll wheel.” This feature was not explicitly announced by Apple in its WWDC iOS 13 and iPadOS reveal segments.
