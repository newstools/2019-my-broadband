Showmax has announced that it will be adding live coverage of the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations to its recently-launched live sports content. Showmax’s new sports section, which offers live streaming, extended highlights, and popular sports magazine shows, is available to all South African Showmax customers at no additional charge. It is available on all Showmax apps and platforms except for Apple TV, Xbox, and PlayStation, as well as some smart TVs. “We’re preparing for a future when uncapped data is affordable to all in Africa and video on demand becomes the norm,” said MultiChoice Connected Video CEO Niclas Ekdahl earlier this week. “Sport is the obvious next target and the only way to do that properly is to be able to stream it live.” Bafana Bafana’s Africa Cup of Nations campaign begins on 24 June when they take on Ivory Coast.
