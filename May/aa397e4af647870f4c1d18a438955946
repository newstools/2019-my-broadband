Uber is testing out a new PIN feature which aims to speed up pickup times at airports, TechCrunch reports. This feature provides riders with a one-time numeric code, which they can then provide to the first available Uber driver instead of waiting for a pre-specified vehicle. The driver then types the rider’s one-time PIN into their Uber app and can immediately set off on their ride. Uber told TechCrunch that it is currently trialing the PIN system at Portland International Airport in the United States, adding that it could roll out the feature to other airports if the trial proved successful. “If we zoom out and think about how much unprecedented growth airports are experiencing all over the world, it’s an important strategic partnership for us to work really closely with airports,” Uber said.
