Absa announced that it has successfully migrated the digital channels of 10 African subsidiaries from the UK to it’s data centre in South Africa. Absa’s platforms in Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique, and National Bank of Commerce in Tanzania (NBC) were migrated to Absa’s local data centre over a two-day period from 18-19 May. These subsidiaries join six more – Tanzania, Ghana, Botswana, Zambia, Mauritius and Seychelles – which were migrated to the bank’s South African data centre last month. According to Absa, benefits that will be gained from the migration project include: “These projects were large and complex undertakings that required meticulous planning by highly skilled teams,” said Absa chief executive of engineering services Paul O’Flaherty. “We are proud to have executed them successfully, as part of our broader separation programme which will be completed in the next year.”
