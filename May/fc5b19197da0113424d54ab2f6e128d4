A database containing sensitive personal data, including South African ID numbers and plain text passwords, was discovered on a public web server belonging to ViewFines last year. Prior to this, Home Affairs leaked data through a contact form on its website – while a real estate group exposed a database containing a variety of details of essentially every South African in 2017. Security experts such as SensePost CTO Dominic White told MyBroadband that even a small amount of leaked personal data can empower an attacker to gain access to private information. This can grant attackers access to your accounts, for example. White demonstrated this by using the leaked information of a coworker to hack into their online medical aid account. This gave him access to the ID numbers and full names of dependents and their recent medical records. In addition to this, your ID number itself reveals a lot of information about you – as detailed below. A South African ID number is a 13-digit number which is defined by the following format: YYMMDDSSSSCAZ. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-177247" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/South-African-ID-number.jpg" alt="South African ID number" width="640" height="600" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/South-African-ID-number.jpg 1280w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/South-African-ID-number-768x720.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/South-African-ID-number-459x430.jpg 459w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/South-African-ID-number-640x600.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Before the race group classification was abandoned, this is what digit A in the ID number indicated: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-177191 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-ID-book-287x430.jpg" alt="Old-ID-book" width="287" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-ID-book-287x430.jpg 287w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-ID-book.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 85vw, 287px" /> The last digit of a South African ID number is calculated using the Luhn algorithm, which allows for basic error detection. To check whether an ID number is valid, the Luhn algorithm may be applied as follows: An example of this calculation, using our fictional ID number from before, is shown below:
