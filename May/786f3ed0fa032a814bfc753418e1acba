Spotify will begin testing voice-enabled ads for mobile users in the United States, TechCrunch reports. This feature will prompt free users to respond verbally during the course of an audio advertisement. According to the report, one ad will promote Spotify Original podcast Stay Free: The Story of the Clash, while another will promote a playlist related to an Axe ad campaign later in May. The ads will only be tested on a small group of Spotify’s free mobile listeners in the US who have enabled Spotify’s voice controls feature. Participating users will reportedly be prompted to say “Play Now,” and will be taken to the advertised content if they do this. If they say anything else, their microphone will be turned off and they will hear traditional ads instead. Spotify hinted towards the roll-out of this trial in an earnings call with investors earlier this week. “We believe voice — really across all platforms — are critical areas of growth, particularly for music and audio content,” said Daniel Ek, Spotify co-founder and CEO. “We’re investing in it, and we’re testing ways to explore and refine our offering in this arena.”
