Cryptocurrency is taking off again, with Bitcoin climbing back above the $8,000 mark for the first time this year. During the height of its popularity, many users tried to cash in on the surging prices of various cryptocurrencies. Some of these investors made a lot of money in a short period of time, while others saw their savings disappear as their chosen cryptocurrency fell through the floor. These antics culminated in a slow but steady decline in the market capitalisation of major cryptocurrencies, with mainstream buyers losing interest and ICOs failing to produce the financial results expected. Blockchain-backed tokens are on the rise again, however, and they have already delivered impressive profits so far this year. This phenomenon seems to have occurred across the entire cryptocurrency market, from major tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to smaller coins like TRON and Cardano. To determine how much money you would have made if you invested at the beginning of 2019, we compared the price of the top 10 cryptocurrencies from 1 January to 15 May 2019. We converted dollar pricing on CoinMarketCap to South African rand, and we excluded Tether as it essentially functions as a token representing the fiat US dollar. It is important to note that cryptocurrency is not a stable or traditional investment, and you should ensure that you understand the nature of the digital asset you are purchasing, along with how to store it correctly. All figures below reflect prices at the time of writing on 15 May 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-306292"
