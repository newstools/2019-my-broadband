The Eskom Board has announced that Eskom Group Chief Executive Officer Phakamani Hadebe will step down at the end of July 2019. According to the Chairman of the Eskom Board, Jabu Mabuza, Phakamani has been instrumental in driving stability at Eskom during a very challenging period at the organisation. “We have learnt to depend on his resilience to drive the kind of transformation that South Africa expects of our organisation,” said Mabuza. “Appreciating the toll that this takes on an individual, we have had to, with regret, accept his decision.” “It is no secret that this role comes with unimaginable demands which have unfortunately had a negative impact on my health,” said Hadebe. “In the best interests of Eskom and my family, I have therefore decided to step down.” Hadebe recently said the company has been plagued by corruption at all levels in the organization. He said they are working with the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to identify and root out corrupt behaviour and activities. “We have identified a number of companies that need to pay Eskom back for questionable dealings they have been involved in,” Hadebe said. What is of grave concern, he said, is that these companies could not be involved in corrupt dealings with Eskom without the active enablement and support from some Eskom employees. He is, however, confident of change and said he looks forward to a future where Eskom employees are energized to go to work and give of their best.
