Good news for people who want to work at Afrihost is that the company is growing and is looking for the right skills. Afrihost said it is always looking for good developers who will fit into the company’s “family values” culture. “We’ve struggled to find developers. While we have managed to recruit very talented developers, this is an area we’d like to grow further,” Afrihost said. Apart from having the right skills, Afrihost is looking for candidates who are aligned to its culture. “A candidate who has impressive skills, but is not a good fit, is unlikely to be successful,” the company said.

Our culture is all about serving our clients – first and foremost,” Afrihost said. The best thing an applicant can do when applying for a job at Afrihost is to research the company, understand its values, and show that there is a strong alignment. “We can usually find a place in the company for someone that we know will be part of the family for a long time to come,” Afrihost said.
