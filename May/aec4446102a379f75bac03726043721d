FlySafair is scheduled to begin its “Jive for R5” sale at 09:00 today, offering 45,000 one-way flights for the price of R5 each. Customers can purchase these limited discounted tickets on the FlySafair website by queuing in a dedicated waiting room and being randomly selected for access to purchase the tickets. Upon navigating to the website, users are redirected to waitingroom.flysafair.co.za to queue for their chance to purchase a R5 ticket. However, this web page currently presents a 504 Gateway Time-Out Error, making it impossible to join the waiting room and attempt to buy a ticket. Safair acknowledged the problem in a Facebook post, stating that its servers were encountering issues due to the number of people attempting to buy R5 tickets. The website is currently down at the time of writing, making it impossible for users to purchase the limited tickets. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305382" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FlySafair-Gateway-timeout-640x315.jpg" alt="FlySafair Gateway timeout" width="640" height="315" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FlySafair-Gateway-timeout-640x315.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FlySafair-Gateway-timeout-600x295.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FlySafair-Gateway-timeout-768x378.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FlySafair-Gateway-timeout-1200x591.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
