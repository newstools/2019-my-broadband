Google has announced that it will retire its YouTube Gaming platform on 30 May, with all gaming content being transferred to the primary YouTube platform. “We want to continue to build a stronger home for the gaming community that thrives on YouTube, not just the YouTube Gaming app,” said Google. According to Google, over 200 million users already visit the main YouTube app to engage with gaming content, meaning that it makes sense to transition all gaming content onto the primary platform. Current YouTube Gaming app users can merge their subscriptions across YouTube and YouTube Gaming to continue consuming YouTube Gaming content through the main YouTube app. Google also highlighted that YouTube has a gaming-specific homepage within its main platform, which can be accessed here. YouTube Gaming launched in 2015 as a competitor to popular game streaming platform Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.
