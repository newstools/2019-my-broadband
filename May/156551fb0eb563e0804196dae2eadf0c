MWEB has launched a new VoIP service which offers identity calling, itemised billing, call forwarding, call history, and usage notifications. The MWEB VoIP service allows users to make voice calls over the Internet and “save on the cost of both local and International calls”. A big benefit of the service is that subscribers get free calls to other MWEB VoIP numbers – essentially free on-net calls. MWEB CEO Sean Nourse told MyBroadband that their new VoIP products have been a “fantastic addition to our product offerings and we have already seen a lot of interest from our customers”. MWEB is current offering two VoIP bundles: a Starter package with 100 minutes at R59 per month, and a Lite package with 250 minutes at R99 per month. These monthly subscriptions translate into call rates of 59c per minute and 39.6c per minute respectively. The packages are available on month-to-month deals and new subscribers have the option to keep their existing number, said MWEB. The table below provides an overview of MWEB’s VoIP packages.
