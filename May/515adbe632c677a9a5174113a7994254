Samsung’s Galaxy Fold will not launch in June, reports Yonhap News. A Samsung representative said that the Fold’s release schedule has not yet been decided. It is believed that Samsung is taking extra care to ensure a smooth release of the Galaxy Fold due to Huawei’s recent issues with US companies – with Samsung hoping that the Galaxy Fold can usurp the Mate X to become the most desirable foldable smartphone on the market. The Galaxy Fold was originally scheduled to launch in April, but display and build-related problems resulted in Samsung postponing the launch. Yonhap News previously reported that Samsung had taken on several strategies to fix the Galaxy Fold, including reducing the size of its hinge and increasing the size of the plastic screen cover.
