Point Topic released its Q1 2019 residential broadband tariffs report, which shows that South Africa has the biggest difference in the world between entry-level, average, and median broadband prices. Point Topic’s residential broadband report compares the entry-level, median, and average residential broadband tariffs in 83 countries. To provide an easy way to compare prices, Point Topic took the PPP data for broadband tariffs in each country, produced rankings, and then compared the variance. According to the report, Venezuela, Iran, and Ukraine have the most affordable broadband services, while Mauritania, Oman, and the UAE are the most expensive. South Africa ranks at number 69 and 70 for median and average fixed-broadband prices respectively. What this means is that the average price for an ADSL, VDSL, or fibre connection in South Africa is significantly more than most other countries in the world. The country’s entry-level broadband prices, however, are the sixth most affordable for the countries in this survey. As part of its ranking system, Point Topic included variance to indicate how different ranks for the different metrics are spread. This portrays the difference between entry-level, average, and high-end broadband packages in a country. The report revealed that South Africa has a broadband pricing variance of 1,344 – more than double that of Albania (658) which is in second place. Point Topic’s broadband tariff country scorecard is shown below, with the countries at the top of the chart offering the best median tariffs. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305500" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-Prices-by-Country.png" alt="" width="640" height="1495" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-Prices-by-Country.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-Prices-by-Country-171x400.png 171w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-Prices-by-Country-184x430.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
