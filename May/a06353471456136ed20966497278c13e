A laptop filled with six of the world’s most dangerous viruses and malware has sold for $1.2 million at auction, The Verge reported. The Samsung NC10 laptop that hosts the malware has been named “The Persistence of Chaos” by its creator, artist Guo O Dong, and was commissioned by cybersecurity firm Deep Instinct. The six viruses on the laptop are estimated to have caused a combined $95 billion in damages. Included in the six viruses is the infamous WannaCry, which caused nearly $4 billion in damage across about 150 countries, as well as MyDoom, which was the fastest-spreading email worm in history. The laptop will be used as an artistic creation only, the report stated, and is currently air-gapped to prevent it from being accessed.
