Microsoft has released a preview build of its new Chromium-powered Edge browser for macOS. The company launched the first preview builds of the new browser for Windows 10 last month, and it has now begun testing the software on other platforms. Microsoft said the macOS version of its Edge browser will offer the same experience as the Windows version and will include optimisations to improve the user experience on Mac devices. “We are tailoring the overall look and feel to match what macOS users expect from apps on this platform.” Microsoft said. The browser will also make use of specific hardware features available on Mac devices such as Touch Bar integration and trackpad gesture support. A preview build of the Edge browser for macOS is available to download from the Microsoft Edge Insider site.
