Activision has announced its new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game, which is set to support cross-play – although the extent of this functionality is not yet known. Unlike previous games, it won’t feature a Season Pass for maps that are released after launch. Instead, developer Infinity Ward will be providing more content for free. It will feature a single-player campaign as well as co-op and multiplayer modes, alongside an all-new storyline and narrative that extends across all game modes. However, popular characters like Captain John Price will still be a part of the storyline. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare will launch on 25 October across Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. Watch the reveal trailer below.
