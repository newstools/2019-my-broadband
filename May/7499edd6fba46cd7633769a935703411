CareerJunction has released its April 2019 CareerJunction Index (CJI) report, which shows a big decline in the number of IT jobs advertised in South Africa in 2019. The CJI is based on data gathered from the CareerJunction website and monitors the labour market in South Africa by examining supply and demand trends. The report revealed that there is increased competition for jobs among job seekers – with fewer jobs and more people competing for those jobs. The business and management sectors were particularly hard hit, with a 29% year-on-year decline in job volumes. The CareerJunction Index showed a big decline in IT jobs in 2019, with a particularly rapid decline in April. This is partly due to the high number of public holidays, but also because of lower demand due to a weak local economy. Some good news is that software development remains at the top of recruiters’ most-wanted list. Over 23% of vacancies on CareerJunction are IT-related, with the majority of these allocated to software developers. The graph below shows volume trends for IT job adverts published on the CareerJunction website over the past 12 months. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-306704" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ICT-JObs.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="411" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ICT-JObs.jpg 608w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ICT-JObs-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ICT-JObs-592x400.jpg 592w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
