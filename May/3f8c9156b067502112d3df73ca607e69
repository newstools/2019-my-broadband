Point Topic released its latest World Fixed Broadband Statistics report which shows that the number of fibre connections are growing while copper-based services are declining. The report showed that the number of copper lines globally fell by 8% over the last year, while FTTH connections increased by 22%. “The trend of subscribers dropping copper in favour of fibre continues across the globe,” Point Topic said. While Point Topic’s report focused on global and regional trends, the same thing is happening in South Africa. ADSL users across the country are migrating to fibre-to-the-home in areas where fibre infrastructure is available. In areas where fibre is not available, users are opting for fixed-wireless solutions like LTE-A from Rain, Cell C and Telkom for higher speeds. The charts below show the breakdown of fixed-broadband technologies across the world, and the year-on-year growth rate of the different technologies. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304722 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tech-Market-Share-640x392.png" alt="" width="640" height="392" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tech-Market-Share-640x392.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tech-Market-Share-600x367.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tech-Market-Share-768x470.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tech-Market-Share.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304724" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Growth.png" alt="" width="640" height="454" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Growth.png 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Growth-564x400.png 564w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Growth-768x545.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Growth-607x430.png 607w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
