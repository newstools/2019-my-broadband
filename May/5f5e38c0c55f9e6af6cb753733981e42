Samsung is attempting to entice smartphone customers away from Huawei by launching a trade-in programme for Huawei device owners, The Korea Times reports. The company has launched a new campaign in Singapore, offering discounts of up to $550 on a new Samsung Galaxy S10 to customers who trade in their Huawei smartphones. Samsung reportedly offers an additional trade-in value of around $145 for selected Huawei smartphones, including the Huawei P20 Pro, Mate 20 Pro and Nova 3i. Huawei is not the only competitor included in this programme, with Samsung stating that it is also targeting iPhone users with trade-in incentives. Huawei was recently placed on the US Entity List, which resulted in the company losing its Android licence as well as the licence to use technology from various other US organisations, including ARM and the SD Association. The company said it would continue to provide support to existing Huawei smartphone owners, but the extent to which this trade ban will affect Huaweiâ€™s smartphone business remains unclear.
