Sony has revealed new details about its next gaming console, expected to be the PlayStation 5. The company shared the information as part of a corporate strategy presentation. The first bit of good news is that the console will be backwards-compatible and users can play PlayStation 4 games on the unit. It will also be compatible with the PlayStation VR. Additionally, the next-generation console will support physical game discs. Sony added that the PlayStation 4 will remain the “engine of engagement of profitability” for the next three years, while it is speculated that the PlayStation 5 may launch in 2020. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307088" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Loading-screen.png" alt="Loading screen" width="640" height="363" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Loading-screen.png 1740w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Loading-screen-600x341.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Loading-screen-768x436.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Loading-screen-640x363.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Loading-screen-1200x681.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Looking at the hardware in the PlayStation 5, Sony said the console will be powered by a new CPU and GPU. Sony previously told Wired that the next-generation console will feature a third-generation AMD Ryzen CPU with eight cores, and a custom AMD Radeon Navi GPU. The graphics chip will support ray tracing, while Sony said the new PlayStation will support 8K graphics. Storage in the PlayStation 5 will be taken care of with SSDs, compared to the PlayStation 4’s current hard drives. This hardware contributes to the PlayStation 5 being 10-times faster than a PlayStation 4 Pro at loading complex scenes. No pricing or launch date information was shared by Sony. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307090 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Next-gen-features-640x361.png" alt="Next-gen features" width="640" height="361" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Next-gen-features-640x361.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Next-gen-features-600x339.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Next-gen-features-768x433.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Next-gen-features-1200x677.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
