WhatsApp has updated the beta version of its iOS messaging app, adding a number of improvements focused around media sharing, WABetaInfo reports. WhatsApp has changed the way messages containing multiple photos are presented to the receiver, with the message now displaying exactly how many items are included in the album. Following the implementation of this update, users will no longer be able to copy, save, or export the profile pictures of their contacts. The messaging app has also made a number of changes to its audio and video messages for iOS, changing the export codec for voice messages to M4A and adding a number of improvements to streaming videos which have not yet been downloaded by recipients. The beta update shows that WhatsApp is also working on adding a new type of message which includes interactive buttons. These changes were submitted in a new update for the iOS version of the application and will reportedly be available in the next update on the App Store.
