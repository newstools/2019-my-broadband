Microsoft has stopped providing Huawei with Windows licences as part of its efforts to comply with US trade limitations against the Chinese company, The South China Morning Post reported. Windows operating systems running on current Huawei PCs will not be affected, but Microsoft will no longer accept new product orders from Huawei. Microsoft’s services team has also reportedly begun moving out of its Chinese headquarters in Shenzhen. “This does not mean that Microsoft is not cooperating with Huawei any more. The suspension in business between the two companies could be just temporary,” said an unnamed Microsoft employee from these headquarters. Microsoft has already taken significant actions against Huawei as part of its compliance with the US government order, including the removal of Huawei hardware and cloud products from its online marketplaces. Huawei mobile chief executive for business, Richard Yu Chengdong, said earlier this week that Huawei plans on launching its own operating systems which could be compatible with Android and Windows.
