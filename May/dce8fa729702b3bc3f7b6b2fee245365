Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) allow users to surf the internet without being tracked by ISPs and other online entities. Many VPN users seek to improve their online privacy, while others use the services to access region-restricted content. VPNs range from free versions – which are usually inefficient and offer only basic features and limited bandwidth – to high-quality, speedy solutions which charge a monthly fee. While different VPNs offer specific features which may make them attractive to different users, ultimately one of the most important considerations when picking a VPN is speed. PCMag recently performed tests on some of the most popular VPNs to determine which of these offer the best speed to their users. In these tests, “speed” refers to the percentage by which internet speed is changed when using these VPNs as opposed to the speed without them. This means that a lower percentage is better. The test was performed on a 1Gbps connection. Here are the five fastest VPNs. Private Internet Access is based in the USA but runs through over 3,000 servers across the world. Up to five connections are allowed at one time and there are no restrictions on how much traffic may be consumed when using this service. It also has the ability to block ads from showing during your web surfing sessions. Private Internet Access offers a seven day money-back guarantee if you are unhappy with the service.
