Ster-Kinekor has launched a movie subscription club, where users pay a monthly fee and are then allowed to watch multiple movies per month. Ster-Kinekor said that two tiers are available to users: The four tickets are valid for 2D and 3D movies, and excludes premium showings such as IMAX, D-BOX, Cine Prestige, and special events. The company stated that for the MORvies Club, up to five 2D or 3D movie tickets per day can be selected. This excludes premium showings such as IMAX, D-BOX, Cine Prestige, and special events. “Ster-Kinekor MORVies Club members cannot make multiple ticket purchases for the same session nor can they purchase movie tickets for any other person. Only the registered member can use the card allocated to them and no other person or third party,” it said. The company said the pricing for the plans will be locked for three months. The first payment must be made immediately, while the following two payments will be debit orders. “Ster-Kinekor may make changes to any products or services offered on the website, or to the applicable prices for any such products or services, at any time, without prior notice. Any changes, however, would not affect the initial 3-month price lock applicable to your package and would only come into effect on expiry of your initial 3-month price lock period.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-306920" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SK-Club.jpg" alt="SK Club" width="640" height="934" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SK-Club.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SK-Club-274x400.jpg 274w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SK-Club-768x1121.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SK-Club-295x430.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
