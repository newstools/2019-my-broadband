Snap employees have used their access to a dedicated data-access tool to see privileged information of Snapchat users, Motherboard reports. The tool, called SnapLion, allows Snap to access user data including locations, phone numbers, email addresses, and the users’ saved Snaps. SnapLion was originally developed to be used for information gathering in response to legal requirements, such as court orders or subpoenas. However, one of the former employees, who spoke to Motherboard on the condition of anonymity, said that data access abuse occurred “a few times” at Snap. The abuse was reportedly carried out by multiple employees, and Motherboard also claimed to have seen an email where employees discuss how “insider threats” need to be combated. In response to the report, a Snap spokesperson said that the company has “robust policies and controls” to limit internal access to user data. “Unauthorized access of any kind is a clear violation of the company’s standards of business conduct and, if detected, results in immediate termination.”
