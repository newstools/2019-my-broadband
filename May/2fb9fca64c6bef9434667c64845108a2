Open Source Week 2019, which includes the PyConZA, LinuxConf, and PostgresConf events, will take place at The Wanderers in Johannesburg from 7-11 October. Open Source Week 2019 kicks off with LinuxConf [ZA] 2019 – an Open Source and Linux conference – on 7 October. Topics covered at LinuxConf [ZA] will include Linux Kernel and OS, Linux distributions, virtualisation, system administration, open source applications, networking, and development environments. PostgresConf South Africa 2019, a conference dedicated to the PostgreSQL database, takes place on 8 October. It forms part of the international PostgreSQL conference series and serves the database administration and developer communities. At this conference delegates and speakers will exchange ideas and learn about features and upcoming trends within PostgreSQL. 10 and 11 October are dedicated to PyConZA 2019, where the Python software community gathers to spread knowledge and learn from one another. Delegates can expect talks about the frontier of software development, data science, and security. There will also be half-day and full-day workshops, and tutorial sessions focussing on open source software. Registrations are open for the events and early-bird tickets are available for all three conferences. Conference organiser Malcolm McLean said there are also a wide range of sponsorship packages at each conference for companies who want to support this great initiative.
