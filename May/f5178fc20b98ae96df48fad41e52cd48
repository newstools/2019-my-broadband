DStv Now users who tried to use the service on Sunday were greeted with the message “Error 500 – There is a problem with the page you requested”. The DStv Now service was unavailable for a few hours on Sunday which prevented users from viewing high-profile sporting events like the Premier League’s final matches. The company said on Twitter that their technical teams are aware of performance issues on DStv Now and have been working round the clock to resolve these problems. “This is due to the Optimization that’s currently being done to improve the overall viewing experiences,” the company said. This is the second outage in the past week with many users expressing their frustration on social media. MultiChoice Connected Video head of communications, Richard Boorman said on Friday that they were busy investigating the outage on Thursday evening. “We’re currently busy with a full post-mortem to determine the exact cause of the outage,” said Boorman. “Broadly the cause was a systems update which we’d tested ahead of deployment without any issues arising, but unfortunately in the live environment it failed”.
