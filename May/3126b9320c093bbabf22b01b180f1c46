Facebook will begin publishing adverts on WhatsApp’s status page starting next year, according to a tweet by an attendee of a Facebook Marketing Summit. “WhatsApp will bring Stories Ads in its status product in 2020,” the tweet said, showing the presentation which confirmed the launch date. WhatsApp vice president Chris Daniels told journalists in October 2018 that adverts within the Status feature would be the “primary monetisation mode for the company”. This latest development means that previous reports suggesting that adverts could come to WhatsApp as soon as 2019 appear to be incorrect. WhatsApp will join fellow Facebook-owned social media platform Instagram in running adverts through its Status feature. Facebook also recently announced that it would be implementing business catalogues within WhatsApp. “With catalogues, businesses can showcase their goods so people can easily discover them,” said Facebook.
