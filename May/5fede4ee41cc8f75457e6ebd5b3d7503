Afristay has a simple strategy to compete against Airbnb in South Africa – tailor its entire experience to suit South African travellers and make the booking process fast and easy. The company is also adding a personal touch to its service with dedicated booking agents helping clients. This strategy is paying off. Over the last year, the company grew by 350% in booking and traffic and it is now averaging 700,000 web visitors per month. All of Afristay’s listings are pre-verified and guest transactions are thoroughly checked and confirmed. The platform hosts listings across more than 2,000 unique African locations, making it an accessible and secure accommodation platform for travellers exploring Africa. Speaking to MyBroadband, Afristay director Rupert Bryant said the company is aiming to do R140 million in bookings in 2019. This growth, Rupert said, is a result of their strong focus on customer service and their obsession over ensuring that they offer an excellent experience every time. “If there’s ever a problem, or you want to check something, you can pick up the phone and call us to get hold of us right away,” he said. A large percentage of Afristay’s growth is coming from return customers, which shows that the company’s focus on the quality of its service is working. The company’s system, which offers clients discounts on future bookings, is also paying off with a large group of loyal customers.
