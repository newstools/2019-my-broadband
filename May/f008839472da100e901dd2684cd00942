Match is working on a version of its dating app named Tinder Lite, which aims to deliver a smaller and more lightweight experience, TechCrunch reports. This Lite version of the dating app requires less data, bandwidth, and storage space than the standard Tinder app, making it ideal for users in countries where mobile data is relatively expensive. Match CEO Mandy Ginsberg told investors during an earnings call that Tinder Lite would launch soon, although she did not reveal an official release date for the stripped-down app. Tinder Lite is aimed at markets such as India, where Internet penetration has grown greatly in recent years. “Tinder Lite will be a smaller app to download,” Ginsberg said. “It will take less space on your phone, making Tinder more effective, even in more remote areas or regions.” “And keep in mind, these are regions where data usage still comes at a premium.” Tinder Lite may lack some resource-intensive features found in the full version of the app, but it will run better on cheaper smartphones and will not be as data-hungry as the full version.
