The annual Rush esports event will take place at the Sun Arena at Time Square in Pretoria from 28 – 30 June 2019. This year’s event will run in conjunction with the seventh annual GeekFest, offering a combination of competitive gaming and geek-themed entertainment over a three-day expo. “The partnering of these two South African-born events is an exciting alliance because, as exposure for this type of gaming and entertainment grows, so does the sector; meaning that local fans can continue to expect bigger and better offerings as the events and gaming community evolve,” said Rush marketing manager Lauren Das Neves. “Local collaboration is key as it enables fans of both events to have a more interactive experience at the same venue.” Rush will feature a number of gaming competitions across various titles and platforms, with specific tournaments scheduled to be announced on 17 May 2019.
