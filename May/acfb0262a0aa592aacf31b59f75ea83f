Thousands of South Africans are moving abroad, with the UK, Australia, and New Zealand being popular destinations. In 2018, for example, the UK government granted 45,000 work permits to South Africans. Statistics from BusinessTech also show that over 5,500 South Africans moved to New Zealand during 2018. The reasons for moving abroad are numerous, and include the high rate of crime in South Africa, high unemployment, collapsing public services, and a failing government. The opportunity to expand their career and earn more money are other key drivers for South Africans going overseas. As stated, the UK is a popular destination for South Africans and there is a large expat community in the country. Pew Research has estimated that at the end of 2017, there were 210,000 South African migrants in the UK. An easy way for an individual to move to the UK is through work – either by a company transfer or after finding a job with a UK-based employer. For IT professionals looking to move to the UK, the country’s occupation shortage list identifies several IT positions which need skilled labour. The lack of skilled professionals in these positions make it easier for individuals outside of the UK to apply for a job and successfully obtain a work visa. IT positions which are currently on the list are detailed below.
