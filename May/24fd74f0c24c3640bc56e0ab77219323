Vodacom Business announced that it has partnered with BlackFog to provide a new cybersecurity and privacy solution to customers. “BlackFog is an on-device solution that blocks outbound data in real-time, preventing cyber-attacks before they happen,” said BlackFog VP for global marketing Brenda Robb. Robb added that BlackFog offers 12 layers of defense against malicious threats including ransomware, spyware, malware, phishing, unauthorized data collection and profiling. “BlackFog spots attackers in real-time, as soon as an attacker attempts to remove unauthorized data from the device, BlackFog shuts them down before they get the chance.” This includes the following security measures: “BlackFog’s unique approach to cybersecurity and data loss using outbound data protection was an important part of the decision process,” said Vodacom executive head for cyber security Sunkay Ramessur. During the initial rollout of the security solution, BlackFog will be sold via the Vodacom account management channel. The BlackFog app is available to Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android users. “Installing the app on each device ensures maximum protection for the end user even when outside of the Vodacom network,” said Robb. No pricing has been made public for the BlackFog service.
