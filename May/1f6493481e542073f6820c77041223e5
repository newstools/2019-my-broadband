Standard Bank has launched SimplyBlu – a new and easy-to-use platform which allows South Africans to start their own online store. SimplyBlu offers an all-in-one solution which supports in-app payments, web store payments, Masterpass, tokenisation, and fraud monitoring. The platform provides you with easy-to-use tools to set up your own online store or ecommerce platform. All card transactions facilitated by SimplyBlu are 3D Secure authenticated and PCI DSS compliant. According to the platform’s terms and conditions, SimplyBlu is designed and developed by Mastercard to help merchants manage their businesses. SimplyBlu also provides an account management dashboard between the merchant’s online store and Standard Bank’s payment processing system. The platform offers everything from web hosting to overnight transaction settlement, making it a comprehensive solution for various ecommerce solutions. SimplyBlu allows clients to build their own online store using a simple drag-and-drop interface with built-in templates, and it also includes a web store address. Clients can set up customisable electronic invoices which allow their customers to pay securely through email, and the Mastercard Payment Gateway can be integrated into their ecommerce site for improved payment processing. When it comes to processing transactions, ecommerce clients using SimplyBlu can accept domestic and international card payments from major card companies including Mastercard and Visa. These transactions are settled overnight into the client’s Standard Bank account. Customers can apply for Standard Bank’s SimplyBlu offering on the bank’s official website, provided they have the required identification and business registration documents. Standard Bank stated that it would hold a launch event for the SimplyBlu event on 4 June 2019. The launch of SimplyBlu follows the availability of other comprehensive ecommerce solutions in South Africa, including distribution and warehousing through ParcelNinja and delivery through Pargo.
