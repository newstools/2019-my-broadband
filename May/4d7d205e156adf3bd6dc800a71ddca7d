Samsungâ€™s upcoming Galaxy A70S smartphone could be the first handset to have a 64MP camera sensor, ET News reports. The report said the smartphone is expected to launch in the second half of 2019, adding that the Galaxy Note 10 would not include the new high-quality sensor. Currently, the highest-quality image sensor implemented on a smartphone is 48MP, which was first released by Sony last year. The reported added that Samsung is taking the approach of launching high-end features on its cheaper devices in an effort to combat manufacturers such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which launch high-end smartphones at a more affordable price. Samsung has implemented cutting-edge camera technology on its Galaxy A Series before in the Galaxy A80 smartphone, which boasts a 48MP rotating main camera.
