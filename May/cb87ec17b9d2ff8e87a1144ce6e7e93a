A great solid state drive (SSD) is a must-have for any modern desktop or laptop build. Whether it is a cheap 2.5-inch SATA SSD with just enough capacity for your operating system or a high-speed PCIe NVMe drive with exceptional read and write speeds, all SSDs offer an immediate upgrade over their mechanical counterparts. If you are looking for the best performance possible however, it is important to pick out a high-speed M.2 PCIe SSD. These drives are available from major manufacturers including Samsung, Western Digital, and Intel, and they have become steadily cheaper since their initial arrival on the market. Using performance data from AnandTech’s benchmark database, we have ranked the best-performing SSDs available in South Africa below. The 10 fastest SSDs available in South Africa, along with their local pricing, are detailed below. The hardware was ranked according to results from AnandTech’s ATSB – The Destroyer benchmark, which replicates access patterns of I/O-intensive desktop usage. This test measures average data rate in megabytes per second (MB/s) and provides a good overview of real-world drive capabilities, especially under heavy workloads.. Certain SSDs were excluded as they are not readily available in South Africa, including products from Zotac, Plextor, OCZ, and Patriot. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-294762" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Intel-Optane-905P-SSD.jpg" alt="Intel Optane 905P SSD" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Intel-Optane-905P-SSD.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Intel-Optane-905P-SSD-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Intel-Optane-905P-SSD-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
