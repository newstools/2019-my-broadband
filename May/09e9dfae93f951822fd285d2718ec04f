MTN has issued a statement to customers warning them of a new scam which has been targeting its customer base. In this scam, somebody claiming to be an MTN agent approaches individuals or companies attempting to sell VIP mobile numbers. VIP numbers contain unique combinations of numbers which are easy to remember or can be read as a specific company or person’s name. The scammer offers this number to victims, claiming that MTN will automatically register a VIP mobile number on their behalf for a fee of up to R20,000 per number. If the customer falls for this scam, they are either given an unregistered or fraudulent SIM card. After the customer has bought the so -alled “VIP” SIM card, the scammer tricks them into believing the SIM card they bought has been registered and it will be activated after one hour. A few hours later, victims realise they have been scammed when they still cannot use the new SIM card. Alternatively, the number being sold to customers may be a VIP mobile number obtained through SIM swap or porting. After this is sold to the victim and they call to query the fraud, the number is returned to its original owner and the victim is unable to continue using it. “MTN is urging all its customers not to respond to these VIP number calls,” the company said. “Customers should report these scams to the SAPS and to MTN through the fraud desk at CRFraudqueries@mtn.com.”
