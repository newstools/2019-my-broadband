Qualcomm expects to receive at least $4.5 billion in payment from Apple as a result of a settlement agreement the pair reached in April. “Our GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 includes revenues of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion resulting from the settlement of our prior disputes with Apple and the contract manufacturers,” Qualcomm said in a footnote in its second quarter earnings report. Apple and Qualcomm surprised many by settling their public patent dispute just one day after the pair locked horns in court last month. Qualcomm was suing Apple for a variety of patent infringements over the years, and had already won one of these cases in a Chinese court. “We are also pleased to have reached multi-year agreements with Apple and look forward to continuing to support them as a customer,” added Qualcomm.
