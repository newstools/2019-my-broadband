Cell C will increase the price of its 1GB WhatsApp data bundle, which lasts for 30 days, from R20 to R29 from 5 June 2019. Cell C explained that its pricing is determined by multiple factors and it has become necessary to increase this price by 45%. “Cell C’s WhatsApp bundle still offers great value for money and is still competitively priced in the South African market,” the company said. Cell C added that it remains committed to its aim to keep customers connected at the most affordable prices. This price increase follows WhatsApp data bundle price changes from Vodacom and MTN, which also increased the effective price to consumers. Vodacom increased the price of its 30-day 1GB WhatsApp data bundle from R29 to R35, while MTN decreased the lifespan of its 1GB WhatsApp data bundle from 30 days to 20 days.
