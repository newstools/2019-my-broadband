Uber Eats has launched a “Pick-Up” service for users in Johannesburg. From today, users can order food through Uber Eats and then pick up their meal from the restaurant. Just under 400 restaurants – including KFC’s, Krispy Kreme, and Col’Cacchios – are available for Pick-Up requests. The price of the meals in app remain the same, and there is no charge to pick up a meal. Ailyssa Pretorius, General Manager for Uber Eats South Africa, said they want to support the growth of the restaurant industry in South Africa. “That’s why we’re launching a new service to help bricks and mortar restaurants grow their business, while providing users with a quick and convenient way to access food on-the-go,” said Pretorius. “Although this is primarily a test and learn opportunity, we look forward to receiving feedback from customers before optimising and expanding further.” Uber launched Pick-Up services in several US cities at the start of 2019, while the Pick-Up offering is also available in Paris and London.
