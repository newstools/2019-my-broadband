Communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams announced that government has paid ICASA the first part of its annual budget, after the regulator threatened to take legal action against the department for non-payment. TechCentral reported that more then R100 million was paid to ICASA, although the minister is not happy ICASA made a public display of government’s lack of payment. One day before government paid the first instalment of its funding owed to ICASA, the regulator instructed its attorneys to launch legal action against the Department of Communications to release the funding allocated to it. Keabetswe Modimoeng, the acting chairperson of ICASA, told media about the situation at an emergency press briefing at the regulator’s headquarters in Centurion on Monday. He confirmed that there was a dispute and that ICASA had not received any of its annual allocation of funding – which totalled around R400 million. The withholding of ICASA’s first tranche payment is unlawful and tantamount to a complete shutdown of the regulator, Modimoeng said. Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams maintained that no minister was explicitly told not to pay ICASA the funds owed to it, and said she was concerned with how ICASA handled the nonpayment situation.
