Many people prefer to watch movies in 2D instead of 3D, which was confirmed by a MyBroadband poll where 80% of respondents said they enjoyed 2D movies more. Despite this preference, many high-profile movies are nearly exclusively offered in 3D when they hit the circuit. A good example is the blockbuster Avengers: Endgame, for which it was virtually impossible to find a 2D screening during the opening weekend. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many people watch movies like Avengers: Endgame in 3D because they have no choice and not because they prefer it over a 2D experience. This raises the question – why do cinemas have mostly 3D screenings when a new title is released when there is a strong demand for 2D movies? Chantelle Burrows, Nu Metro Cinemas’ marketing and content executive, told MyBroadband that the feedback the company receives is that customers prefer 3D movies. “3D relates to an enhanced, premium experience of the film in cinemas, with many films specifically produced by filmmakers to be screened in specialised formats such as 3D,” said Burrows. She explained that 3D titles are usually scheduled for mostly 3D screenings in at least the first week of their release. After the first week, show times and cinema types are reviewed on a week-by-week basis based on public demand, Burrows said. Using the Avengers: Endgame example, Burrows explained that from week two onwards, Nu Metro’s schedule includes 2D screenings for ‘Avengers: Endgame’ at the majority of its cinemas nationwide.
