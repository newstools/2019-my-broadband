Apple has launched its new iPod Touch, which boasts an A10 Fusion processor and up to 256GB of internal storage. The device will run iOS 12 and provide users with access to Apple Music, which can be used to download music over Wi-Fi for offline listening. Apple’s newest iPod Touch will also be able to run and will be compatible with the company’s upcoming “Apple Arcade” gaming subscription service. The new iPod Touch is small and light by modern smartphone standards, featuring a 4-inch Retina display and ultra-thin 6.1mm chassis which weighs just 88 grams. “The ultra-thin and lightweight design of iPod Touch has always made it ideal for enjoying games, music and so much more wherever you go,” said Greg Joswiak, VP for Product Marketing at Apple. “We’re making the most affordable iOS device even better with performance that is twice as fast as before, Group FaceTime, and augmented reality starting at just $199,” Joswiak said. The iPod Touch will be available for $199 from Apple’s website and in the Apple Store app. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307858" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iPod-Touch-2019-Arcade.jpg" alt="iPod Touch 2019 Arcade" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iPod-Touch-2019-Arcade.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iPod-Touch-2019-Arcade-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iPod-Touch-2019-Arcade-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
