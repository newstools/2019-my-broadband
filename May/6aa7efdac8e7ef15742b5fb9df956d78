Mathematical Literacy was introduced as a new subject in the South African curriculum in 2006 and was stigmatised as a “dumb version” of real mathematics. Mathematical Literacy is, however, a completely different subject to mathematics with a strong focus on the role that mathematics plays in the modern world. This, the Department of Basic Education explains, will help learners to interpret and critically analyse everyday situations and solve problems. Mathematics, in comparison, focuses on more formal and abstract mathematical concepts and caters for learners who have an interest and aptitude in scientific fields. Mathematical Literacy is therefore not merely an easier version of mathematics, but rather a new subject with different content. But how easy is matric Mathematical Literacy?
