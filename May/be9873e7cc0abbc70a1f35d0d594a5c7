Inflation and unfavourable exchange rates make it difficult to find good purchases on a budget, with useful tech products becoming increasingly expensive. Smartphones and laptops can cost a pretty penny, to the point where Apple’s Phone Xs Max costs more than a seven-night luxury skiing trip. There are still many gadgets you can buy without breaking the bank, however, without being forced to compromise on quality. These include everything from DIY electronics and robotics kits to powerful networking systems and recording hardware. While many 3D printers are expensive and difficult to use, the da Vinci Mini is neither. It has a maximum build volume of 150 x 150 x 150 mm with a resolution of up to 0.1mm. Filaments for this printer are relatively cheap and are made using PLA plastics, which are biodegradable and non-toxic. Whether you are building complex scale models or project components, a 3D Printer would be a welcome addition to a workstation. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-305772" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3D-Printer.jpg" alt="3D Printer" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3D-Printer.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3D-Printer-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3D-Printer-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If you enjoy reading and are getting tired of lugging your books around, a Kindle is a no-brainer.
