Naspers and WeWork have announced that Naspers’ Johannesburg team will move to WeWork’s Johannesburg office when it opens in August 2019. The Johannesburg office is located at The Link in Rosebank, opposite the Gautrain Rosebank train station. “Over 400,000 members are now based at WeWork locations around the world, and member businesses range from start-ups to mid and large-sized companies,” said WeWork. “International locations serve as a base for business travel, as well as offer opportunities for companies to easily expand abroad.” It added that larger enterprise companies now make up more than 30% of its global membership. “Over the years, more and more corporates are coming to us to be part of our global community,” WeWork said.
