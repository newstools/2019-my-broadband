AMD has set a launch date of Q3 2019 for its upcoming AMD Navi graphics cards, Softpedia News reports. The Navi GPU lineup will be built on a 7nm manufacturing process, and its low-end model could reportedly rival the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070. It will also support ray tracing – a feature introduced by Nvidia in its RTX 20 series – and will ship with GDDR6 memory. Rumours suggest that the launch of the Navi is likely to be in the earlier stages of Q3, with many reports suggesting that the launch could take place as soon as 7 July. WCCFTech claims to have been told by sources that the Navi will cost as little as $249 – making it an attractively-priced competitor to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070. AMD originally wanted to release the Navi last year, but was forced to delay its launch.
