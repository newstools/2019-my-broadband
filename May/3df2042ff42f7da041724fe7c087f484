Point Topic has released its Q1 2019 fixed-broadband tariffs report, which shows that South African entry-level broadband prices are in line with international standards. The report compares broadband tariffs across different technologies, looking at price and speed variations around the world. All prices in the report are quoted in US dollars at PPP (purchasing power parity) rates to allow for easier comparisons. According to the report, the average price for a copper-based broadband service – ADSL and VDSL – is $65 (R935) per month. The average speed of these copper-based broadband connections was 11Mbps, in line with Telkom’s average ADSL and VDSL speeds. An uncapped 10Mbps DSL connection from Afrihost is priced between R679 and R999 per month, which is similar to international rates. When it comes to fibre-to-the-home (FTTH), however, South African speeds lag behind international standards. According to the report, the average speed for an international FTTH service is 278Mbps, which is significantly higher than local speeds. Local users typically take lines between 10Mbps and 200Mbps. The average monthly price for an FTTH service is $99 (R1,423) per month, which is in line with what South African consumers pay. The graphs below provide an overview of the average price of fixed-broadband access across the world. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305562 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-Price-640x416.png" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-Price-640x416.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-Price-600x390.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-Price.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305566 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Price-per-Mbps-640x418.png" alt="" width="640" height="418" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Price-per-Mbps-640x418.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Price-per-Mbps-600x391.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Price-per-Mbps.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
