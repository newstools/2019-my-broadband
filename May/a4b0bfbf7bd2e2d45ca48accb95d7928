Intel announced that it will begin shipping its new 10nm CPUs from June this year. The company also revealed an expected launch date for its upcoming 7nm graphics chip. The new 10nm processors are designed for mobile PCs and will be known as Intel’s “Ice Lake” range. According to Intel, Ice Lake CPUs will deliver “approximately 3 times faster wireless speeds, 2 times faster video transcode speeds, 2 times faster graphics performance, and 2.5 to 3 times faster artificial intelligence (AI) performance over previous generation products”. Intel added that it plans on launching multiple other 10nm products throughout 2019 and 2020, including CPUs for client and server systems, general-purpose GPUs, and Intel’s upcoming “Snow Ridge” 5G-ready network system-on-chip (SOC). The company also announced its plans to launch its first general-purpose 7nm product, a GPU, in 2021. Before this, however, Intel will launch a high-performance 7nm GPU for data centres, AI, and high-performance computing. This will be launched in 2020.
