Microsoft has launched a private preview version of a new online code editor named Visual Studio Online. This platform is based on the open-source Visual Studio Code desktop code editor, and will support all extensions supported by the original editor as well as IntelliCode support. Microsoft said its Visual Studio Online editor is a companion to the standard Visual Studio platform, and is positioned to aid in sharing information as well as making quick edits or reviewing pull requests. The platform will have a similar interface to Visual Studio Code and will support Live Share, enabling various collaborative features. Once the online code editor rolls out to all users, it will be available at online.visualstudio.com and will be accessible from any device. Microsoft did not state when this platform would become publicly available.
