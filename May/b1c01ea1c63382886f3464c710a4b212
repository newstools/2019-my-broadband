TaoTronics is an international consumer electronics company and specialises in the development of a wide variety of products including sound bars, LED lamps, and even air humidifiers at affordable prices – without compromising on product quality. One of the most popular products in their catalogue are their high-quality headsets, which offer a great audio experience without costing an arm and a leg. Until now, this great brand has not been available to South Africans, but thankfully this is set to change. TaoTronics headsets, sound bars and LED Lamps are now coming to South African customers thanks to Syntech – who are already exclusive distributors of other popular hardware brands like Crucial, Redragon, and Romoss. These products will be available on Takealot at highly competitive prices. Syntech provided us with two TaoTronics headsets to test – the TT-BH22 active noise cancellation (ANC) over-ear headphones, and their TT-BH07 sport in-ear earphones. The BH22 headphones offer a truly premium listening experience. Audio played through these headphones is full and immersive. They offer deep, strong and crisp higher tones. After extensive testing across various music genres, it is clear that no matter what music style you listen to, the BH22 headphones will be a fantastic fit. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304746" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-3-638x430.jpg" alt="headphones-3" width="638" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-3-638x430.jpg 638w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-3-593x400.jpg 593w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-3-768x518.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-3-1200x809.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> They also offer a great experience when listening to podcasts or watching movies, as the clear audio almost makes it feel as if you’re in the same room as the people speaking. Their active noise cancellation technology is one of the most impressive features of this headset. It ensures that you minimise background noise and get the most out of every song without being distracted by your surroundings. As a result, listening to music with the BH22s truly feels like you’ve entered a new world. In our MyBroadband offices, which are regularly filled with discussions and conversations, the BH22 headphones blocked out this sound with ease, allowing me to focus on my work without being distracted by office chatter. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304748" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-4-640x427.jpg" alt="headphones-4" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-4-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/headphones-4-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The BH22 headphones ship with a USB charging cable and a 3.5mm audio cable.

This audio is further optimised by Qualcomm’s aptX audio technology, which improves the transmission of sound through Bluetooth. TaoTronics’ website says that the earphones offer up to 6 hours of playtime and take just 1 hour to charge. The TT-BH07 earbuds cost just R569 on Takealot.
