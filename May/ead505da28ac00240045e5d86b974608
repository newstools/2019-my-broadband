Google will roll out its Gmail confidential mode feature to G Suite users on June 25, activating the mode by default on all accounts. The feature will allow G Suite users to write confidential emails and access a range of security and privacy features. Email senders can set an expiration date for their messages, after which access to the email will no longer be possible. Additionally, confidential emails are not available to be forwarded, printed, downloaded, or have their contents copied. Users can also request SMS verification before an email can be read. To disable confidential mode once it reaches general availability, administrators can navigate to Apps > G Suite > Settings for Gmail > User settings. The feature is currently available for beta testing from the G Suite menu.
