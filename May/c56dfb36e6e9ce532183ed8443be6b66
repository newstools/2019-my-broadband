SEACOM announced that it has added eight new Points of Presence (PoPs) across Africa. The company extended its presence in Kenya by installing a new PoP in Mombasa, which connect’s Kenya’s first open-access data centre onto its network. SEACOM said it has similar plans for new open-access PoPs which will be implemented in Nairobi and Kampala. In South Africa, SEACOM also deployed a new PoP inside the Teraco Bredell data centre, which the company said is a key location which caters specifically to content providers and enterprise customers. “It will also serve as an important data recovery site for many operators,” SEACOM said. SEACOM’s PoPs bypass the public Internet in connecting company networks to digital solutions, offering line rates of up to 100Gbps and improved latency. “The moves that SEACOM is making to improve our infrastructure on the continent will benefit African companies with greater high-speed, reliable and secure connectivity to cloud services and other online tools,” the company said.
