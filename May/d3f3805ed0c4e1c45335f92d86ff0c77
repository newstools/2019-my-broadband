Huawei recently released its new MediaPad M5 Lite tablet, which offers premium features and design at an attractive price. The 10.1-inch device boasts a Full HD IPS display which offers good sharpness and contrast, and is compatible with the Huawei M-Pen Lite stylus. The hardware is built to deliver a good Android experience – and we tested out Huawei’s new tablet to see if it delivers. The specifications of the device are below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305846" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-640x360.jpg" alt="Huawei MediaPad M5 Lite 1" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Both the display and audio of the MediaPad M5 Lite are exceptional and the device’s software offers the familiar Android 8.0 interface paired with useful gestures and support for the stylus. The M-Pen Lite stylus boasts 2,048 layers of pressure sensitivity, making it ideal for users who value fine detail notes and sketches when using their tablet. Huawei’s MediaPad M5 Lite delivers serious audio capabilities, boasting four Harman Kardon speakers which deliver professional-quality sound. Chipset performance is also impressive thanks to the tablet’s octa-core processor, which allowed for responsive and smooth performance across multiple apps without any noticeable slowdowns. The tablet includes a number of kid-friendly features and applications, too, allowing parents to set limits to their child’s usage. During our test, watching YouTube videos on the tablet was an awesome experience compared to a smartphone. Not only was the display larger, but the audio was far better than any smartphone we have tested. The EMUI 8.0 operating system also works perfectly in tablet format, and is a complete pleasure to use when paired with the M-Pen Lite stylus. Writing messages was another fun element, with the stylus and the tablet’s text converter turning handwriting into typed text. This is present in all applications. Overall, we were impressed by the hardware and design of the MediaPad M5 Lite – and its high-end features paired with its price make it a formidable competitor in the South African tablet market. The device is priced at R5,999 on the Huawei Store. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305848" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-2-640x360.jpg" alt="Huawei MediaPad M5 Lite 2" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-2-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305852" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-4-640x360.jpg" alt="Huawei MediaPad M5 Lite 4" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-4-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-4-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-4-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305850" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-3-640x360.jpg" alt="Huawei MediaPad M5 Lite 3" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-3-640x360.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-3-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-MediaPad-M5-Lite-3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
