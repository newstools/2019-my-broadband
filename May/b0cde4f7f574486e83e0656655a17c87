Samsung recently launched its new QLED TVs in South Africa, which includes its first 8K consumer QLED TV. These QLED 2019 TVs offer superior colour depth, contrast, and picture quality compared to other displays and include a number of high-end features. One of the biggest competitors to Samsung in the high-end range is LG, however, with its OLED TV range also excellent image quality to high-end customers. We compared the latest generation of Samsung’s QLED TVs against the LG OLED TVs available in South Africa to see how they stack up. The biggest difference between the two ranges is the display technology behind their panels. Samsung’s QLED panels are a variant of LED TV technology, which means they use LCD panels with LED backlighting – and include a layer of quantum dot film within the LCD panel. For this reason, the backlighting of a QLED TV makes a big difference to picture quality and can vary between product models. OLED panels are different to traditional LCD displays and do not require any backlighting, as the OLED pixels themselves emit light. This removes the need for any backlight and generally means OLED panels deliver better contrast ratios compared to standard LCD TVs. OLED has traditionally been more expensive than LED technologies, though. Using official pricing and product listings online, we have compared LG and Samsung’s top 55, 65, and 75-inch TVs below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-288020" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LG-C8-OLED-639x430.png" alt="LG C8 OLED" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LG-C8-OLED-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LG-C8-OLED-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LG-C8-OLED-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LG-C8-OLED.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303976" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q90R.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q90R.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q90R-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-QLED-Q90R-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303974" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900.jpg" alt="Samsung Q900" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Q900-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
