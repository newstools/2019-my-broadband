Apple has committed to being more upfront about the performance and battery health effects of iOS updates on its devices. The company told the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that it would provide more detailed and accurate information about the performance impact of iOS updates going forward. Apple was investigated by the CMA for not disclosing that a software update issued in 2017 slowed down older iPhones. “The CMA became concerned that people might have tried to repair their phone or replace it because they weren’t aware the software update had caused the handset to slow down,” the authority said. “In addition, people were not able to easily find information about the health of their phone’s battery, which can degrade over time.” According to the watchdog group, Apple has now formally committed to notifying users when a software update is expected to impact performance, and it will also provide information on how to improve iPhone battery health.
