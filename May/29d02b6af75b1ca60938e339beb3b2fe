A report by South Korean news site Yonhap News claims that Samsung is planning to make changes to the Galaxy Fold so that it can be released again. According to the report, Samsung plans to reduce the size of the hinge so that it better suits the frame of the smartphone. This should reduce the risk of this hinge breaking. Another issue experienced by reviewers of the original Galaxy Fold was that the display included what appeared to be a screen protector which was actually part of the display. When users peeled this film off, they damaged the phone. The report states that this plastic cover will be made larger – to a point where it can be tucked into the frame of the smartphone, ensuring that users don’t mistakenly peel it off. The updated Galaxy Fold could be launched as soon as next month.
