MWEB has launched its new fibre-to-the-home advertising campaign this month, taking aim at Telkom’s landline services. The advertisement features former Springbok coach and SuperSport personality Nick Mallett encouraging a landline user to switch to fibre. Referencing the man’s landline phone, Mallett says “I bet if this thing rings, it is a telemarketer. You really need friends that badly?”. “With fibre from MWEB you can make friends all over the world. Voice, Video, Conference Calls. I think it will be good for you,” he says. The phone then rings, after which Mallett hands the phone to the man with the words, “It is the 90s calling. They want their landline back”. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> This is not the first time MWEB has taken aim at Telkom in its broadband advertising. In 2012, MWEB used Telkom’s call centre background music to poke fun at the company in its ADSL advertising. MWEB, which at the time launched a wide range of online tools to interact with the company, subtly referenced Telkom’s poor call centre performance in its advert. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
