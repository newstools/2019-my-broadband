Rain has changed the network name it shows on cellphones to “GO Proteas” ahead of the ICC Cricket World Cup, which began on 30 May with South Africa playing England. The network operator told MyBroadband that it may keep it on for the duration of the World Cup. “But we will make the call later on,” said Rain. “We just wanted to show our support for our boys. We’re big Cricket fans.” Cellular networks have globally-unique numbers which identify them, known as Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) codes. These PLMN codes are made up of a country code and a number for the network. Rather than displaying this code, cellphones instead use something more human-readable — the PLMN name. The PLMN names of networks may be stored on the cellphones themselves, and in the network operator’s SIM cards. A network operator can also override the stored PLMN name with a custom string. Not all devices will display the custom PLMN name however, meaning that not all cellphones on the Rain network will display the “GO Proteas” message. “Unfortunately it depends on the handset,” Rain said. The following screenshot shows Rain’s temporary PLMN name showing on an iPhone.
