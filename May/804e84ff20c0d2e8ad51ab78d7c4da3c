ARM has announced three new smartphone chips which it expects to be used in premium smartphones from next year. The Cortex-A77 is designed to provide superior AR and VR performance thanks to a 20% increase in instructions per cycle (IPC) over the previous-generation Cortex-A76. ARM added that machine learning performance has improved by 35-times over the course of the past two Cortex-A series CPU releases. “The new Cortex-A77 CPU underpins ARM’s continued push for performance and best-in-class efficiency within smartphone power budgets with performance comparable to today’s mainstream notebooks,” said ARM. ARM also launched the Mali-G77, which is its premium GPU and delivers a nearly 40% improvement over the previous-generation Mali-G76. The Mali-G77 also offers users a 60% improvement to machine learning performance, allowing for superior on-device intelligence. Enhancements to ARM’s dedicated neural processing unit, the ARM ML, were also announced. These improvements include increased energy efficiency and improved memory compression techniques.
