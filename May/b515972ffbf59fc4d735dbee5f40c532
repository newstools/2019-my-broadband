Vodacom has launched two new mobile data deals – 20GB for R149 and 40GB for R199 – aimed at high-end data users. These two deals offer a significant discount on the usual prices for 20GB and 40GB mobile data bundles and are likely a response to MTN’s recent promotion. MTN is offering its business clients 20GB anytime data and 20GB Night Express data for R199 per month. To sweeten the deal, MTN is throwing in an additional 20GB of anytime data for the first month and a 14GB Entertainment Pass for social media and streaming. The R149 and R199 price points are popular with consumers, which is why Vodacom hit back with the two promotions below: These two products are available on 24-month contracts and Night Owl data is available between midnight and 05:00. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-306444" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20GB.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20GB.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20GB-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-306448" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/40GB.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/40GB.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/40GB-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
