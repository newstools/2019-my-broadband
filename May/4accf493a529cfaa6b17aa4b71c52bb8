Steam has published its Hardware Survey for April 2019, listing the most popular components used by gamers on the platform. According to the data, Nvidiaâ€™s GeForce GTX 1060 remains the most popular GPU on Steam, although it should be noted that the survey does not distinguish between the 3GB or 6GB model. The most common amount of VRAM is 2GB, however, with 19.57% of Steam gamers using GPUs with 2GB graphics cards. Intel quad-core processors with a clock speed of between 3.3GHz and 3.69GHz remained the most popular chips, with over half of gamers owning a quad-core CPU. An Intel processor which best matches the most common specifications outlined in the survey is the Intel Core i3-8100, which boast four physical cores and a clock speed of 3.60GHz. Power supplies, motherboards, and cases are not measured by the Steam Hardware Survey, and compatible products were included to provide a pricing overview of a functional PC. The South African pricing for a gaming PC outfitted with the most popular components on Steam is listed below.
