Bitcoin’s nine-day rally has pushed it back above $6,000. The biggest cryptocurrency outperformed its closest peers again in the digital market on Thursday and has now rebounded more than 90% from its trough last December. It’s the latest milestone as the wild ride continues for the decade-old token, which crashed last year from a peak of more than $19,000 in 2017. “The only store of value in the space right now is Bitcoin,” said Michael Novogratz, co-founder and chief executive at Galaxy Investment Partners LLC. “It doesn’t need to change — it’s gold,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg Television from a conference in Las Vegas. The token gained 2.7% to $6,060 at 9:43 a.m. in London, according to Bloomberg composite pricing. The MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 10 basket of the largest digital currencies rose just 1.1%, having fallen the previous day. Bitcoin’s nine-weekday winning streak is the longest since May 2017. It shrugged off a brief sell-off Wednesday after Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, said hackers withdrew 7,000 Bitcoins worth about $40 million at the time. Security remains one of the key obstacles to mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, given the industry’s history of hacks. At a gathering Tuesday in Chicago, some of the largest traders including DRW Holdings Inc.’s Cumberland crypto unit and Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Holdings discussed creating a blacklist of counterparties known to renege on trades or engage in nefarious activities. “Bitcoin’s long-term technical profiles continue to point to a new up cycle,” said Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC technical strategist Rob Sluymer in a note May 8. He reckons the digital asset is continuing to rebound from support at its 200-week moving average, after telling investors last week to buy. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305656" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Coming-Back-640x360.png" alt="Coming Back" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Coming-Back-640x360.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Coming-Back-600x338.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Coming-Back-768x432.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Coming-Back.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
