MyBroadband has released its April 2019 ISP satisfaction ratings, which show that Supersonic is the top-rated Internet service provider in South Africa. MyBroadband’s ISP satisfaction ratings are based on feedback from 9,781 South African broadband users between 1 April 2019 and 30 April 2019. These ISP ratings are gathered through three speed test platforms: To ensure a neutral testing environment, MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband speed test platform. As part of their speed test, users are also given the opportunity to rate their Internet service provider (ISP) which is then used for the ISP satisfaction ratings report. The table below provides an overview of the ratings of prominent fibre, ADSL, and fixed-LTE service providers in South Africa.
