Google has launched its new Pixel 3a smartphone, which offers similar features and design to the standard Pixel 3. The Pixel 3a has a cheaper and less powerful chipset however, and lacks the IP68 dust and water resistance boasted by the flagship model. Google has positioned the Pixel 3a as a mid-range smartphone with Google’s high-end features, as it has a price tag of $399. The price of this device places it in competition with other impressive mid-range Android devices – most notably the Samsung Galaxy A30 and Huawei P30 Lite. Both of these competing devices were announced earlier this year, and they too combine flagship features with attractive price tags. In terms of pricing, Samsung’s Galaxy A30 is the cheapest of the three smartphones, while Huawei’s P30 Lite is the most expensive. There is no information regarding a South African launch date or pricing for the Google Pixel 3a, so we have used the conversation rate for the device’s international price at the time of writing to provide a rough estimate. We compared the pricing, hardware, and features of the Google Pixel 3a, Galaxy A30, and Huawei P30 Lite below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-305610" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pixel-3a-vs-Galaxy-A30.jpg" alt="Pixel 3a vs Galaxy A30" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pixel-3a-vs-Galaxy-A30.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pixel-3a-vs-Galaxy-A30-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pixel-3a-vs-Galaxy-A30-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-305612" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pixel-3a-vs-P30-Lite.jpg" alt="Pixel 3a vs P30 Lite" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pixel-3a-vs-P30-Lite.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pixel-3a-vs-P30-Lite-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pixel-3a-vs-P30-Lite-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> You will notice that the Pixel 3a has a smaller display panel than its competitors, but uses better display technology than the P30 Lite – OLED. While it also only has a single-lens rear camera system, the Pixel 3a can deliver impressive photos and videos – and the device includes high-end features like HDR+, Portrait Mode, Super Res Zoom, and Night Sight. Additionally, both the P30 Lite and Samsung Galaxy A30 have more flagship-like notched display designs, while the Pixel 3a has traditional bezels. All of these smartphones deliver unprecedented features in the mid-range Android market, and selecting a clear winner is a difficult task.
