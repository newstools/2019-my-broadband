Google is rolling out a feature for South African Google Maps users which will warn them when they are approaching speed cameras along their route. This feature was previously limited to selected markets, but the company confirmed to TechCrunch that it was expanding the availability of this functionality to more than 40 countries. The list of supported regions now include the United States, UK, Australia, India, Russia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, among many others. As this feature rolls out to users in South Africa, more Google Maps users should see their current speed limit in the bottom corner of their navigation app, along with the addition of speed trap icons along their route. According to the report, Google Maps uses a combination of authoritative feeds and feedback from users to pinpoint the location of speed cameras. This feature was previously available in the Waze navigation app, but has now also been absorbed into Google Maps along with other functions such as the ability to find where you parked your car.
