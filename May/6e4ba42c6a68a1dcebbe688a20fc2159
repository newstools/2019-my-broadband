Telkom has released its financial results for the year ended 31 March 2019, which revealed that operating revenue increased by 5.3% to R41.8 billion and EBITDA increased by 8.5% to R11.3 billion. This growth is mainly thanks to the excellent performance of its mobile services revenue, which increased by 58.3%. Telkom grew its active mobile subscribers by 85.9% to 9.7 million users thanks to its affordable data-centric value proposition. The results were not only good news, however. They also revealed the biggest decline in fixed-broadband subscribers the company has ever seen. Telkom’s ADSL, VDSL, and fibre subscribers declined from 981,176 in March 2018 to 847,650 in March 2019. There was also a big decline in Telkom’s fixed-line subscriber base. It now has 2,267,000 fixed-line subscribers, down from 2,678,000 a year ago. The five slides below provide an overview of Telkom’s performance over the past year. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307718 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Finances-640x328.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="328" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Finances-640x328.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Finances-600x308.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Finances-768x394.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Finances-1200x615.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Finances.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307720 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mobile-640x328.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="328" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mobile-640x328.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mobile-600x308.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mobile-768x394.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mobile-1200x615.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mobile.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307722 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-640x328.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="328" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-640x328.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-600x308.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-768x394.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband-1200x615.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Broadband.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307724 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Openserve-640x328.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="328" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Openserve-640x328.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Openserve-600x308.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Openserve-768x394.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Openserve-1200x615.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Openserve.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307726 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BCX-640x328.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="328" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BCX-640x328.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BCX-600x308.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BCX-768x394.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BCX-1200x615.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BCX.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
