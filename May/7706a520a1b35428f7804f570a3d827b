MultiChoice Group has announced the launch of its DStv HD Decoder 6, which replaces its 5-series decoders. The new model has the same functionalities as the HD Decoder 5-series and retains most of its features while offering some new improvements. The new HD Decoder is made of recyclable components, and MultiChoice said it considers recycling as a “pinnacle part of their business operations.” The decoder also includes a micro-SIM and is XtraView compatible with all DStv Explora models on the market. “Through understanding customer preferences and ongoing commitment to innovation and technology advancement, MultiChoice delivers unrivaled access to content across multiple platforms and aims to continuously update its current technology,” the company said. MultiChoice said customers who own an HD Decoder 4 or 5 will not need to replace or upgrade their current device. The new decoder is available from today and can be purchased from DStv service centres and agencies, as well as various retailers. It retails at R399 as a standalone product, and R599 including installation. Photos of the new HD Decoder 6 are below. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304872" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-1-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-1-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-1-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-1-768x512.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304874" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-and-remote-1-639x430.png" alt="" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-and-remote-1-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-and-remote-1-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-and-remote-1-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6-decoder-and-remote-1.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-304876" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6S-remote-new-1-625x430.png" alt="" width="625" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6S-remote-new-1-625x430.png 625w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6S-remote-new-1-582x400.png 582w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6S-remote-new-1-768x528.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DStv-HD-6S-remote-new-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
