When you’re looking for a smaller phone, that still packs a punch while being affordable, it can be a challenge – a challenge that Samsung has overcome with the Galaxy S10e. Features How exceptional is the Galaxy S10e? This exceptional: It offers a capacitive, side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and includes a dual-lens rear camera that’ll make sure you can capture those ultra-wide shots, any time day or night. It also has advanced sensors on the front and back to give users the ability to capture superb quality photos and videos. The 5.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display maintains a premium look, feel and quality, and with the front facing camera inside the display there’s no distracting notch in the middle of the screen. The S10e sports the same premium finish of the S10 and S10+, but comes in vibrant and varied colour options like Prism White, – Black and – Green to the very vibrant statement Canary Yellow. Similar to its flagship counterparts, the S10e is powered by an 8nm 64-bit octa-core processor, but is paired with 128GB of onboard storage and either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. It also boasts a high-capacity battery of 3,100mAh. This article was published in partnership with Samsung.
