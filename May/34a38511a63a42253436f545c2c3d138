Microsoft has announced new features that will be implemented in its Edge Chromium browser. Headlining these new features is an “IE Mode” which will enable businesses to load older sites within the new Edge browser as if they were being loaded in Internet Explorer. The current, non-Chromium version of Edge will open Internet Explorer 11 in its own window for these websites. In the new version, a small Internet Explorer logo will show next to the URL when using IE Mode to show users that websites are being loaded in the older format within the Chromium Edge browser. The browser will allow for the customisation of the new tab page, including the ability to add a custom company logo or feature certain websites in the top tabs. Microsoft will also be implementing a new feature called Collections, which will allow users to collect images and text from web pages into a sidebar panel, from which they can then export the content into their own documents using programs such as Microsoft Word. The company said its new version of Edge will allow for the optional blocking of web trackers based upon three privacy levels: Unrestricted, Balanced, and Strict. Microsoft has not announced when these new features will be available for testing. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
