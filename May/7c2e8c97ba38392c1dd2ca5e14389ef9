The MateBook X Pro has disappeared from the Microsoft Store, and searching for Huawei hardware comes up with no results. According to page cached by Google on 17 May, Huawei’s flagship laptop was listed on the store as recently as last week. The removal of Huawei hardware from the Microsoft Store could be a result of the US recently implementing a ban on Huawei products – putting companies like Microsoft in a tricky position. According to The Verge, however, physical Microsoft stores are still selling their current stock of the MateBook X Pro. Google has already taken strict measures regarding Huawei’s use of its Android software, but the Chinese manufacturer has since received a 90-day licence to keep Android updated on its current devices. When asked by The Verge for comment regarding a potential Huawei ban, Microsoft refused to offer any statement on the matter.
