Huawei has issued a statement regarding Google revoking its Android licence. This move could have serious implications for the manufacturer’s smartphone business. Google said the decision was taken to comply with orders from the US government, which is cracking down on its technology trade with China. The most immediate concerns for Huawei smartphone owners are the loss of access to official Android OS updates and a lack of certified Google applications on upcoming devices. South Africans are in a precarious situation, as there may be no way to access critical Google apps like Gmail, YouTube, and Chrome on future Huawei devices. When it comes to local Huawei smartphone owners, however, there is no need to panic immediately, as Google has said that its Google Play services will continue to function on existing smartphones. Speaking about the US crackdown, Huawei told MyBroadband that it will continue to deliver security updates and after-sales services to existing products. “Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold and that are still in stock globally,” Huawei said. “We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.” The company said that it has been an important participant in the Android ecosystem, and has been a key global partner for Google. “Huawei has made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android around the world,” Huawei said. “As one of Android’s key global partners, we have worked closely with their open-source platform to develop an ecosystem that has benefitted both users and the industry.”
