LG plans to launch its new range of NanoCell televisions in South Africa from May, with wider availability expected in June or July, a spokesperson for the company told MyBroadband. It unveiled the TVs at CES earlier this year, along with its second-generation Alpha 9 processor which powers a deep learning algorithm designed to enhance picture and sound quality. This algorithm analyses the source content, takes in data from an ambient light sensor, and adjusts the tone mapping curve and brightness of the video accordingly. In addition to using machine learning to enhance the quality of content, LG’s new range of TVs can also link to several artificial intelligence services across multiple platforms. This includes Amazon Alexa and the built-in Google Assistant. The updated Google Assistant also enables context-aware voice commands, such as “Do I need an umbrella today?” followed by, “What about tomorrow?”. LG Electronics South Africa has told MyBroadband that it plans to launch its new range of high definition (HD) and Ultra HD TVs from May. Formerly known as LG Super UHD NanoCell, the company has re-branded the TVs to simply “NanoCell”, and the 55-inch model will start becoming available in South Africa during May. It will be more widely available in June and July, LG said. The 65-inch NanoCell TV will launch locally from June, with wider availability in July. LG’s OLED C9 55-inch, 65-inch, and 77-inch variants will be introduced during July. “Pricing has not yet been confirmed and will only be released upon launch into the market as per the above timelines,” LG said. As for LG’s Signature range of TVs, the company said that it has not yet set a retail price for its Roll-up TV, and stated that its W9 “wallpaper” TV would not be released in South Africa. However, South African buyers who were interested in buying the LG Signature W9 could place a special order to have a unit brought into the country for them. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-302962
