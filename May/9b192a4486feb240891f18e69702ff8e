The recently launched P30 series of Huawei’s smartphones has become well-known for its photographic capabilities, which is also what the ‘P’ stands for. The new devices include a number of flagship features such as in-screen fingerprint sensors and OLED displays. But it is the great camera functionality that make these devices tower above their competitors. All three smartphones in the range consist of a Leica triple camera system, which accommodates your photography to help see the world in its entirety by minimising the presence of the front camera notch while expanding the edges of the OLED display in the P30 and P30 Pro. As the Huawei website states, this super camera system with its super sensing camera, ultra-wide-angle lens, and telephoto lens, gives you the freedom to capture the treasure and beauty of the world. The camera system also allows users to capture moments in dark situations like a candlelight dinner or even fireworks. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-305522" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-image.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 image" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-image.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-image-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-image-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The HUAWEI P30 boasts a 32MP front camera, a 40MP wide-angle main camera, its 16MP ultra-wide camera, an additional 8MP telephoto camera, and 30x optical zoom functionality. The 32MP front camera on the HUAWEI P30 will intelligently recognise you to produce expert selfies, while the 40MP main camera – or as Huawei calls it, a Super Spectrum shooter – together with its 16MP ultra-wide camera lens, captures a wider range of colours for richly detailed images, even in low-light conditions. It also packs an 8MP telephoto camera, which provides sharper autofocus as well as 30x optical zoom for spectacular photos from a great distance. While the P30 is perfect for photography, it’s also the perfect phone if you’re looking for something mid-sized at 149.1 x 71.4 x 7.6mm and with a weight of only 165g. It comes in new and refreshing colour variations such as Amber Sunrise, Breathing Crystal, and Aurora, and is available with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. The back and front of the phone are covered in Corning Gorilla Glass, which together with the rounded edges and sleek design give the P30 a premium feel. The 6.1-inch OLED display takes up an impressive amount of the phone’s frontage, broken only by a ‘teardrop’ notch at the top which houses the front-facing camera. The screen has a 2340 x 1080 resolution and supports Full HD+, allowing for a greater brightness range and more vivid colours. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-305524" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-Pro-Image.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 Pro Image" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-Pro-Image.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-Pro-Image-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-Pro-Image-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The HUAWEI P30 Pro boasts the same cutting-edge camera system as the P30 but offers a 50x or SuperZoom lens and an additional ‘time-of-flight’ (TOF) depth-sensing camera lens, which provides improved bokeh effects and object tracking. The HUAWEI P30 Pro also houses a 32MP front camera, which is paired with deep-learning algorithm-assisted facial recognition and image segmentation support. It also sports an almost bezel-less display with in-screen optical fingerprint sensors and is powered by a large 4,200 mAh battery that is capable of providing users with almost an entire day of extensive use. In addition, it supports 40W SuperCharge capabilities in addition to wireless quick charge and reverse wireless charging functionality, all of which is powered by the Kirin 980 processor. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-305526" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-lite-image.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 lite image" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-lite-image.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-lite-image-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-lite-image-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The P30 Lite is the next iteration of the popular mid-range P Lite series – a reasonably priced alternative to its higher-end siblings. While it’s the most affordable of the three, like its premium counterparts, it offers a 32MP selfie camera and triple-camera system. It packs a Kirin 710 processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, and features an IPS LCD display instead of the OLED panels included on the high-end P30 and P30 Pro. The P30 Lite includes a capacitive fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone’s body instead of an in-screen fingerprint sensor as with the premium models. Despite having sacrificed certain features found in its premium counterparts, it still offers a similar physical design and features – such as such as a bezel-less display and a tiny notch at the top of the screen.
