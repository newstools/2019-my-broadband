Netflix has rolled out “studio quality” audio to its streaming service, offering improved audio quality for users with surround sound and Dolby Atmos. The platform has increased its audio bitrate to 640kbps for viewers with 5.1 surround sound system, and also offers a bitrate of up to 768kbps for Dolby Atmos viewers. The latter will only be available to Premium subscribers, but the 640kbps bitrate is available for all Netflix subscribers. Netflix added that it expects these bitrates to evolve over time as it becomes more efficient with its encoding techniques. “After years perfecting our adaptive video switching, we’re thrilled that a similar approach can enable studio quality sound to make it to members’ households, ensuring that every detail of the mix is preserved,” Netflix said.
