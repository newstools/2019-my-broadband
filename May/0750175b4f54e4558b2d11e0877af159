MyBroadband has partnered with Afristay and Huawei to launch South Africa’s biggest mobile network testing project. Mobile Internet access is a cornerstone of a modern economy, and good network quality is necessary to support many of the latest mobile applications. To test the quality of South African mobile networks and find their strengths and shortcomings, MyBroadband has launched its 2019 mobile network testing project. The project will provide a comprehensive look at cellular network quality in South Africa, and include two main components: The project kicked off in Gauteng in mid-May, and will include tests in all nine provinces and all major cities over the coming weeks. MyBroadband has partnered with antenna and wireless communications specialist Poynting to improve its test bench and test vehicle design, to ensure accurate network testing results. Poynting is a global leader in the design and manufacturing of cellular antennas, which made it a perfect partner for this project. With the help of Professor Andre Fourie and Dr. Derek Nitch, our new test benches were designed to ensure accurate results. The photo below shows one of the new test benches with five Huawei Mate 20 Pro devices – the world’s first phone to support Cat. 21 LTE connections. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-296626 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Test-Bench-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Test-Bench-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Test-Bench-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Test-Bench-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Test-Bench.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MyBroadband also followed the guidance of Fourie and Nitch in its selection and design of its dedicated testing vehicle. The testing vehicle – a bakkie with a fibreglass canopy – minimises the problems associated with using a passenger car, such as signal penetration due to the vehicle’s metal body. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-306958 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Speed-test-Vehicle.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Speed-test-Vehicle.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Speed-test-Vehicle-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> To conduct speed tests across South Africa means our test vehicle drivers have to sleep over in various locations – from big cities to small towns. Afristay, which has properties across South Africa and is known for its excellent service, was therefore a great choice for MyBroadband as an accommodation partner. Its accommodation portal makes it easy to organise your stay, from planning where you want to spend the night to booking, arrival, and departure.
