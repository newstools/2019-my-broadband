Google’s project to bring Windows 10 to its Chromebook laptops has been abandoned, according to code spotted within the project’s code by a Reddit user. Changes to the project’s code on Gerrit now include lines which directly refer to the initiative being deprecated, including the following statements: /* Deprecated: Enable AltOS Mode on next boot. */
VB2_NV_DEPRECATED_ENABLE_ALT_OS_REQUEST, Google’s plan to bring Windows 10 to its Chromebook platform was code-named Project Campfire internally, although it was never officially announced to the public. Due to the relative obscurity of its development, it is unlikely that the company will make an official announcement regarding the abandonment of the project. Chromebook devices run Google’s Chrome OS operating system, which features integration with its cloud-based Google Drive and Docs platforms.
