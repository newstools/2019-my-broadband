Rain is one of the most exciting new telecoms players in South Africa with a fresh approach to mobile data and growing a network. The operator was born out of WBS, which operated the brands iBurst and Broadlink and was acquired by Multisource in 2015. Rain is backed by the respected bankers Paul Harris and Michael Jordaan, which means it has the financial backing and business clout needed to succeed. It is already generating significant revenue through its roaming agreement with Vodacom, and is growing its own mobile user base through its Rain Mobile retail data offering. Rain has a strong brand in the local market and many young professionals are keen to work for a company which is shaking up an industry. MyBroadband asked Rain CEO Willem Roos what skills they are looking for and what it takes to be employed by Rain. Roos said technical skills are in short supply on South Africa, and it is no exception at telecommunications companies. “To find truly skilled radio engineers, network specialists, software developers, and data scientists is difficult,” said Roos. “However, we have been very excited by the quality of people that we have been able to attract.” Roos said the company is looking for people who will fit into Rain’s culture and who are passionate about what the company would like to achieve. “In technical roles, it is of course important that people have a good mastery of their area of expertise,” said Roos. “However, we think the ability to think from first principles, combined with curiosity about how the world works and the ambition to make a difference in society is much more important in the longer term.” He advised new jobseekers to be interested and knowledgeable about the world around them, not only the area in which they may have studied.
