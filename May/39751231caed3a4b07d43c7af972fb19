A number of Cell C workers are being fired via WhatsApp, according to a report from Tech Financials. The report said the reason for the dismissal of these employees is that they have been tweeting negatively about the company using the hashtags #cellckwenzejani and #savecellc. Cell C has previously applied for a court interdict to stop workers from posting defamatory or inappropriate messages about the company and its staff on public platforms. “Various threats and incidents of hate speech are currently circulating on social media,” said Cell C head of HR Juliet Mhango in the interdict affidavit. “This includes a threat on my life.” A notice of dismissal posted below shows that employees were dismissed due to the content of their tweets via registered mail and WhatsApp message. Some of these tweets were posted by members of the Information Communication and Technology Union (ICTU). These employees previously received a notice from Cell C that informed them of the company’s intention to implement disciplinary actions for participation in unprotected strikes on both 10 and 29 April. Cell C told MyBroadband that it was granted an interdict to prevent the striking employees from blocking the access and exit to the campus. As a result of this interdict, as well as some staff allegedly ignoring two ultimatums by Cell C, the company suspended 378 employees. Cell C employees also joined Tiso Blackstar staff – who were also members of ICTU – in their strike on 30 April, citing their understanding of the plight of the journalists in the country as the reason for doing so. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-303008" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="587" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter.jpg 1010w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter-436x400.jpg 436w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter-768x704.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cell-C-letter-469x430.jpg 469w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cell C did not confirm whether it had fired employees over their tweets, or whether employees had been served with notices of dismissal via WhatsApp. “It would be inappropriate to comment on disciplinary proceedings between an employee and an employer,” Cell C told MyBroadband. “However, we can confirm that all disciplinary proceedings are fully compliant with the Labour Relations Act.”
