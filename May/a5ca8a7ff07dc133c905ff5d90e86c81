Cloud backup provider Backblaze has released its hard drive reliability statistics for the first quarter of 2019. The company compared active hard drives used in its operations from Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba, and HGST to compile the report. Reliability was measured as an annualised failure rate, calculated using the number of drive failures relative to the number of active drive days for each disk. Backblaze recorded the number of failures for each hard drive from 1 January to 31 March 2019, extrapolating the annualised failure rate from this data. It was using 104,325 hard drives to store data at the end of Q1 2019, although it removed from consideration drives that were used for testing purposes and models for which it did not have at least 45 drives. Backblaze noted that while the total number of drives in service decreased by 648 since the end of last year, the backup provider added almost 60 petabytes of storage. This can be attributed to the migration from smaller drives to larger drive sizes. Backblaze predicts that it will have fewer than 15,000 4TB drives by the end of 2019 while increasing its available cloud storage capacity to over 1 exabyte. The most reliable hard drives for Q1 2019, as well as their lifetime failure rates from 20 April 2013 to 31 March 2019, are listed below.
