Post-paid subscribers increased by 26.8%, with net additions of approximately 396,000 to reach 1.9 million, with an ARPU of R186.” The sharp increase in customers has also led to a jump in data revenue for Telkom, which increased by 34.7% to R8.91 billion. Looking at mobile data revenue growth only, numbers were up 60.7% to R5.91 billion. The improved performance of Telkom’s mobile division did not come without costs, however, and direct costs associated with the mobile business increased 20.7%. This was largely due to “an increase in store footprint and extension of distribution channels and an increase in dealers incentives”. Maintenance costs to support a 28.7% increase in mobile sites by 1,142 sites in the year were also noted.
