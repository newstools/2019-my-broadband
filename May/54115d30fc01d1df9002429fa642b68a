2019 is bringing you Batwoman and Elseworlds, the crossover episode that everyone is talking about.

There are always consequences to travelling through time though, aren’t there? The season opener put the focus back on family, which has always been the real heart of The Flash. The thing about being Team Flash is that you’re great at the planning, but the curve balls can really mess with your mojo, especially if the curveball is a visitor who you’re really going to care about, once they exist, in a timeline that may or may not exist anymore, depending on what you do in this timeline.

The last time we saw Oliver Queen, he had just outed himself to the world as The Green Arrow, handed himself over to the FBI, and asked his allies, friends and partners to complete his mission to save the city. But season seven opened with the team split up and working on different sides, and there’s nothing Oliver can do about it because he’s just trying to cope with his new identity – as Prisoner 4587.

They take our jobs, our culture. They steal from us. They hurt us … We don’t need their heroes.” Now this xenophobia what-what is even spreading to the Arrowverse? Fortunately, anti-alien terrorist organisation Cadmus will only be getting one answer from Supergirl: “This is my home. And my mission is to protect it.” Season three’s cliff-hanger ending left us with so many wheres, hows, whos and even, for that matter, whens, that Supergirl has some serious explaining to do. The fallout from Kara’s time jumps is catching up with her, and the implications of Cadmus’s sinister endgame are going to keep her very busy. There are also some radical new characters on their way this season.

Fans are saying this season is even better than the last, as well as – unbelievably – crazier, zanier, more raucous, riotous and all-out insane. Basically, they’re bringing the circus to the circus. Which is what happens when you pull John Constantine out of the hat because there’s a whole lot of magic that comes along for the ride. And most of it is pretty dark.

It’s never been the sort of place you’d think of moving to start a family, but when the criminals and the cockroaches start leaving, well … this is where heroes like Jim Gordon and Bruce Wayne really need to step up and clean up. We’ll be keeping an extra beady eye on a certain someone in a top hat, the guy in the green suit, the poisonous redhead, and frankly anyone with an exaggerated sense of humour, but riddle us this: Will this or will this not be the Batman endgame we’ve all been waiting for?
