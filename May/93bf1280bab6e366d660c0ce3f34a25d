Facebook announced that it will be making two ranking changes to its news feed to prioritise relevant links and content from close friends. The social media giant said that it learned from surveying Facebook users who their closest friends are, and has used this information to develop an algorithm that extends to the wider Facebook community. “This doesn’t mean News Feed will be limited to posts from only certain people and it doesn’t mean you will necessarily see more friend content,” said Facebook. “Rather, you will likely see posts from those you have close relationships with higher up in your news feed.” Facebook added that this prediction model will be updated continuously based on the interactions these users have with their friends online. The other change implemented by Facebook, also informed by surveys it has conducted on users, is an update to its news feed algorithm to show links that it predicts will interest users. Facebook said these changes shouldn’t show more or less content from pages. “Rather, the Page links that are surfaced to people will be ones they find worth their time.”
