President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced his new cabinet, which will lead South Africa. Following his recent inauguration, Ramaphosa said that while South Africans have felt the warm embrace of liberty, they have also known moments of doubt. He highlighted that the problems the country face include poverty, poor healthcare, unemployment, and corruption. “Our people have watched as some of those in whom they had invested their trust have surrendered to the temptation of power and riches,” he said. “They have seen some of the very institutions of our democracy eroded and resources squandered. The challenges that we face are real, but they are not insurmountable.” Many South Africans have called on Ramaphosa to cut the size of his cabinet and remove incompetent and corrupt ministers. This has been done to a degree, with the number of ministers reduced from 36 to 28. However, certain departments have been given two deputy ministers. Below is Ramaphosa’s new cabinet, which was announced today.
