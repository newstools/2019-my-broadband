The IT and telecommunications companies which pay the highest salaries in South Africa are ICASA, the SABC, and Vodacom. This is based on the latest data available from the annual reports of JSE listed companies and state-owned enterprises. While state-owned enterprises list the average personnel cost and average salary per employee, JSE-listed companies like Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom do not provide this information. Instead, MyBroadband used the company’s total staff bill and divided it by the number of employees to get the average salary per employee. The figures show that, with the exception of Vodacom, state-owned companies pay significantly higher salaries than large JSE-listed telecommunications companies. This is particularly strange, as many state-owned enterprises struggle to make a profit and often ask the government for bailouts to stay afloat. The table below shows the average salaries of prominent state-owned and listed ICT companies in South Africa. The annual reports also shed light on the average salaries of top managers at these companies. It should be noted that the salaries for Blue Label Telecoms, Vodacom, and MTN’s top management are not listed because they do not report the income of all its top managers.
