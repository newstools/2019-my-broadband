IBM X-Force has released a report which shows that hacktivism – hacking for the point of promoting an activist agenda – has decreased by about 95% in the past four years. According to X-Force, hacktivism has dropped from 35 reported instances in 2015 to just two last year. So far, no instances of hacktivism have been reported in 2019. “Most notably, the Anonymous collective and associated groups that identify themselves as Anonymous in different parts of the world perpetrated fewer attacks,” explained X-Force. According to X-Force’s data, Anonymous has contributed to nearly half of all hacktivism attacks since 2015, which has meant that their decline had a massive effect on the general hacktivism landscape. “Arrests and legal warnings issued to hacktivists at large may be acting as an effective deterrent against additional hacktivist activity,” X-Force added. However, X-Force speculates that despite the significant drop it has documented, hacktivism is probably not dying off. “More likely than not, we are experiencing a lull in hacktivist activity rather than a conclusion.”
