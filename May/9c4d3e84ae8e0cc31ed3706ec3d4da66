Telkom has released its financial results for the year ended 31 March 2019, which shows a massive decline in its fixed line subscriber base. Telkom now has 2,267,000 fixed-line subscribers, down from 2,678,000 a year ago. This is a year-on-year decline of 441,000 lines. Over the last six months, the company lost a record 299,000 subscribers, which means it is now losing around 50,000 subscribers each month. While this decline is not new – Telkom has been struggling to hold onto its fixed-line users since 2000 – the rapid loss of fixed lines over the last year may be concerning. Telkom is also losing fixed broadband subscribers despite its continued investment in its fibre rollout. The results show that Telkom’s ADSL, VDSL, and fibre subscribers declined from 981,176 in March 2018 to 847,650 in March 2019. This is by far the biggest decline Telkom has ever seen, and equates to losing over 21,000 fixed broadband subscribers each month. This 13.6% decline in fixed broadband subscribers comes at a time when there is a very strong demand for fibre-to-the-home services in South Africa. The table below provides an overview of Telkom’s fixed-line growth and decline since 1993.
