Apple has released its new MacBook Pro, which is the fastest Mac notebook ever made. The device now boasts a 9th-generation processor with up to eight cores, delivering 40% more performance than a six-core MacBook Pro. Apple’s new MacBook Pro also features a Retina display, super-fast SSD storage, all-day battery life, and Apple’s T2 security chip. “Now with 8-core processors for an incredible performance boost, along with its stunning Retina display, fast storage, all-day battery life, and running macOS, MacBook Pro continues to be the world’s best pro notebook and we can’t wait to get it into our customer’s hands to see what they do next,” said Apple Mac product marketing senior director Tom Boger. The new MacBook Pro is available in 13-inch and 15-inch models, and the latter can be outfitted with either a six-core or eight-core Intel Core processor. Apple said the eight-core model of its new MacBook Pro is up to twice as fast as the fastest quad-core 15-inch MacBook Pro. All new Mac devices come pre-loaded with macOS Mojave, the latest version of Apple’s operating system. This OS includes a built-in dark mode, file stacking, iOS app integration, and a redesigned Mac App Store. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro boasts a 500-nit Retina display with support for the P3 wide colour gamut along with a stereo speaker system. The devices also feature a Touch Bar above the updated keyboard and a large Force Touch trackpad. Apple said its updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro would be priced from $1,799 and $2,399 respectively. A top-of-the-line Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch, with Intel Core 9th-gen i9 CPU, 32GB of RAM, Radeon Pro Vega 20, and 4TB of SSD storage, retails for $6,349 from the US Apple Store. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307140" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-inch-.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-inch-.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-inch--300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-inch--595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-307144" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-MacBook-Pro-15-inch-.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-MacBook-Pro-15-inch-.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-MacBook-Pro-15-inch--300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-MacBook-Pro-15-inch--595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
