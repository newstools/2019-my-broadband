Following a US crackdown on its technology trade with China which resulted in Huawei being barred from working with US companies, iPhone users in China have begun switching to Huawei devices. According to a report by the South China Morning Post, smartphone users in China are switching from iPhone to Huawei to show support for the company. A manager at one of China’s largest solar module manufacturers switched from an iPhone 7 to a Huawei P30, citing a desire to show his support for Huawei in the current climate. Another ex-iPhone user employed at a state-owned telecommunications company switched to Huawei too, saying it was embarrassing to use an iPhone when all company executives in China own Huawei devices. “It’s kind of embarrassing to pull an iPhone out of your pocket nowadays when all the company executives use Huawei,” he said. The report stated that Huawei is winning over customers from Apple in China, and the US ban has only increased customer support for the Chinese smartphone manufacturer.
