Google is blocking users of Microsoft’s Chromium-powered Edge browser from accessing the modern YouTube experience. Microsoft recently released a preview version of its new Edge browser which runs on the Chromium web engine, allowing anyone to download and try out the new browser on their Windows or Mac PC. A Microsoft Edge preview user discovered that while the browser works very well across many popular platforms, Edge preview users are unable to access modern YouTube features, which include the modernised YouTube interface as well as a dark mode for the website. Edge preview users are automatically presented with the old version of the YouTube website, and when they try to manually access the new YouTube via youtube.com/new, the website states that their browser is not supported and requests that they download Google Chrome. However, the page clearly states that YouTube supports the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Edge. While the preview build of the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browser is blocked from accessing the modern YouTube experience, the classic Microsoft Edge browser can still access the new features. It is unclear whether this is an error on Google’s part, as Microsoft previously said it has been working closely with Google engineers on the new Edge browser.
