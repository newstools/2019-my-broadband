Altron has unveiled a brand film which seeks to reveal the intricate relationship between human beings and technology.  The film’s premise is that technology is so intertwined with our everyday lives that it is largely invisible and working in the background. This is not a film about product offerings or services offered by Altron. Instead it is an emotive storytelling concept that shows a delicate portrayal of a family and their intimate relationship with technology over time. The success of the film lies in how it lends something abstract like technology tangibility and take a concept usually spoken about in dispassionate terms and make it part of a family, thus lending it a sense of character and humanity. “At the end of this film we want our audience to recognise their own relationship with technology. We want them to see how it has been part of their lives all along. How it has been part of their growth and part of their memories just like their loved ones,” says Zipporah Maubane, Group Executive: Marketing. The technology in our lives has been there all along and Altron as a brand will continue to be steadfast, reliable, quietly supporting customers and society, and always adapting to their needs. Xolisa Dyeshana, Chief Creative Officer at Joe Public says, “The objective of the film is about Altron being the driver of the sentiment that technology is a facilitator of intimacy and change. Technology has grown with us, changed with us and will continue to be forever entwined with the lives we live.” The long format commercial has been repurposed into 20-second bite-sized product videos to give the viewer a focused look into Altron‘s technologies from biometrics, fleet management, vehicle tracking and recovery, broadband infrastructure services to digital patient records.
