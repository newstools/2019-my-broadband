Fixed-LTE is the connectivity method of choice for many South African households which cannot get fibre-to-the-home services. The service offers subscribers a high-speed, low-latency solution with fairly high monthly usage limits at a much better rate than traditional mobile data products. Telkom was the first company to mass-market its fixed-LTE products in South Africa, and was followed by Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Rain. Rain, however, stopped selling its fixed-LTE products shortly after it launched its mobile data products in 2018. While you can still purchase a Rain SIM and use it in a fixed-LTE router with unlimited data for most of the day, the peak time price of R50 per GB can become a problem. The table below provides an overview of the best fixed LTE deals from Telkom, Vodacom, MTN and Cell C. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305424" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vodacom-LTE.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="472" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vodacom-LTE.jpg 638w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vodacom-LTE-542x400.jpg 542w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vodacom-LTE-582x430.jpg 582w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305426" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MTN-LTE.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="685" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MTN-LTE.jpg 719w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MTN-LTE-374x400.jpg 374w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MTN-LTE-402x430.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305428 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cell-C-LTE-640x397.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cell-C-LTE-640x397.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cell-C-LTE-600x372.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cell-C-LTE.jpg 725w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305422" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Telkom-LTE.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="705" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Telkom-LTE.jpg 754w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Telkom-LTE-363x400.jpg 363w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Telkom-LTE-391x430.jpg 391w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
