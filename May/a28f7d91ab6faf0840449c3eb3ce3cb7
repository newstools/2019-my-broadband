Telkom has released its financial results for the year ended 31 March 2019, which show the biggest decline in fixed-broadband subscribers the company has ever seen. The results show that Telkom’s ADSL, VDSL, and fibre subscribers declined from 981,176 in March 2018 to 847,650 in March 2019. This 13.6% decline in fixed-broadband subscribers comes at a time when there is a strong demand for fibre-to-the-home services in South Africa. Telkom’s Internet all access subscribers, which include includes Telkom Internet ADSL, ISDN, and WiMAX subscribers, declined from 572,402 in March 2018 to 507,172 in March 2019. These declines are likely a result of increased competition from fibre-to-the-home players like Vumatel and fixed-LTE services from Rain, Cell C, Vodacom, and MTN. The table below shows Telkom’s fixed-broadband subscriber numbers over the past 16 years.
