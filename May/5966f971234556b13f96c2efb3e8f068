Valve has launched its Steam Link app for iOS and Apple TV users on the App store. This app will allow Apple product users to stream games from their Steam library to their Apple devices – including their iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. The app is free, and is already available on the App Store to owners of supported Apple products. Steam Link has already been on available on Android devices for a year, but Apple previously blocked Valve from publishing its Steam Link App on the App Store. This happened on 10 May 2018 – three days after Apple had approved the app. The app was reportedly blocked due to “business conflicts with app guidelines” that were allegedly not met by the original review team. However, it appears that Apple has finally changed its stance on the issue.
