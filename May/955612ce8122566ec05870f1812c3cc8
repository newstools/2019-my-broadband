Takealot officially launched its new pickup point system at its flagship Big Bird One Stop pick-up point in Midrand. Takealot has 25 pickup points across the country which offer an alternative to receiving one’s orders via delivery, and the company predicts that 10-15% of its sales will be collected at these points rather than delivered. Orders of over R450 are free to collect, while any orders under R450 will be subject to a R25 collection fee. Speaking at the event, Takealot CEO Kim Reid said the company hopes to have all collections of in-stock products take place within 2 days. Reid added that the company will hopefully offer same-day collection within the next 5-6 months. Reid said that Takealot hopes to launch another 25 pickup points in the next year, taking the total number of locations to around 50. He added that these upcoming pick-up points will be located mostly in larger cities and towns, adding that since Takealot, Superbalist, and Mr D are all under the same business umbrella, this will also play a factor in where any new pickup points are launched. Reid also said that despite being branded as a Takealot pickup point, Superbalist products will also be available for collection at these points. As part of the event, MyBroadband was able to get a peak behind the scenes at how the pickup point operates. Upon arriving at the pickup point, products are stored in a shelving system situated on the second floor, where they are scanned and recorded. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305076" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Storage-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Storage-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Storage-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Storage-768x513.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Storage.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305074" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Storage-2-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Storage-2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Storage-2-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-305078" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Takealot-Storage-3-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Takealot-Storage-3-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Takealot-Storage-3-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Takealot-Storage-3-768x513.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Takealot-Storage-3.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> When the customer wants to collect their order, the package is retrieved and placed on a conveyor belt.
