Facebook announced that it will allow certain cryptocurrency-related ads to be run without requiring pre-approval. Ads that Facebook will now allow to be run without pre-approval include those related to blockchain technology, industry news, education surrounding blockchain, and events relating to cryptocurrencies. However, Facebook said that it will still require pre-approval on ads that actively promote specific cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and mining software and hardware. “This process will continue to take into account licences they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange (or are a subsidiary of a public company) and other relevant public background on their business,” said Facebook. Facebook also announced that as of 5 June, it will update its “Prohibited Financial Products and Services Policy” to include contracts for difference (CFD), which it claims are often used to mislead people by using “predatory behaviour.” The company confirmed that ICOs will continue to be banned from being advertised on Facebook.
