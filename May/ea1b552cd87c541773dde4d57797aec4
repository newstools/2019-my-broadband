ICASA will convene public hearings later this month on the Draft Sports Broadcasting Services Amendment Regulations that were published on 14 December 2018. The regulator has received 39 written submissions from industry players on the draft regulations, 28 of which have confirmed their availability to present before the council. “ICASA has a clear mandate of regulating in the public interest. Therefore, the draft regulations seek to reiterate and ensure that South Africans have access to a wide range of national sporting events and further reflect and give exposure to minority and developmental sport,” says ICASA councillor, Palesa Kadi. The public hearings will be held at African Pride Irene Country Club in Centurion from 27-31 May and ICASA noted the participation in the hearings process with appreciation. “It is really encouraging to see such interest in our regulatory processes because this helps us to make informed decisions that are indeed in the public interest,” said Kadi.
