Samsung South Africa will offer customers who own Galaxy A5, A7, S7, and S7 Edge smartphones a free firmware upgrade. Customers who visit a participating Samsung service centre will be able to save up to 5GB of data this way, and will also receive an installation and activation of Samsung Pay. “Samsung Pay is continuing to blaze new trails with mobile payments in South Africa and this free installation will allow more Samsung users to make full use of its convenience,” said Samsung. Samsung Pay allows customers to make cardless payments. This offer will run until 6 June 2019, said Samsung.
