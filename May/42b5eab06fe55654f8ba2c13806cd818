Criminals are increasingly targeting mobile networks to steal deep-cycle batteries, which make their way into South African homes. Vandalism of cellular networks to steal batteries, copper, and other valuables is nothing new, but this trend is accelerating. Leonie Verster, divisional executive at Bidvest Protea Coin, said people do not realise how big the problem of battery theft is in South Africa. While stolen cellular network batteries were previously destined for countries like Zimbabwe and Malawi, a local market has developed with the advent of load-shedding. Speaking to Carte Blanche, Verster said it is more lucrative to sell the stolen batteries in South Africa because there are no cross-border transport costs and less risk. “They have the demand in South Africa, they can steal and then sell the batteries immediately,” said Verster. The stolen batteries are often sold to unsuspecting people who want to protect themselves against load-shedding or make use of solar power. Unscrupulous companies purchase the stolen batteries from criminals and then install them as part of a load-shedding solution. Verster warns that people who have these stolen batteries in their homes are in trouble, irrespective of whether the batteries are new or second-hand. “You are in possession of stolen commodities and subsequently you are going to be dealt with accordingly,” she said. Carte Blanche highlighted some tell-tale signs to identify stolen batteries and protect you from becoming part of the criminal chain.
