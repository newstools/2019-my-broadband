Ster-Kinekor has launched a new movie subscription club, which offers multiple movie tickets and other benefits to monthly subscribers. The service is only available at certain cinemas, and premium showings – such as IMAX, D-BOX and CinePrestige – are excluded from this service. The club is intended to offer movie-goers better value – and we compared normal movie prices against the new monthly packages to see if this is the case. Pricing for the comparison is based on Eastgate Shopping Centre movie ticket rates. Discounts on popcorn and drinks combos have not been taken into account. Ster-Kinekor Fan Club allows subscribers to access four movies tickets per month for a total fee of R249. One 2D movie ticket at Eastgate costs R86, which means that if you use three or four movie tickets in a month, you will save money with the Ster-Kinekor Fan Club package. A standard 3D movie costs R109 at Eastgate, which again means that using three or more movies tickets will ensure that you are saving money by subscribing to the Fan Club package. The MORvies Club allows members to watch up to five movies per day for a fee of R349 per month. However, unlike Fan Club, you can only purchase one ticket per movie per card holder. If you are a 2D movie watcher, you will need to watch at least five movies each month to save money with the MORvies Club. If you prefer to watch 3D movies, watching four movies per month will be enough to make signing up to the MORvies Club worthwhile.
