Vodacom is not charging subscribers to transfer data from one number to another, the mobile operator has told MyBroadband. The cellular network announced on 27 February that data transfers will be free for 50MB or less, and that it would charge a fee of up to a maximum of R20 for 1GB. It made the announcement along with several others, including a below-inflation price increase on select packages, and a reduction of its out-of-bundle data tariff of up to 70%. The price increases took effect from 1 April, while the reduction in out-of-bundle data charges was implemented on 1 March. Vodacom’s data transfer service was also to launch on 1 March, as stipulated by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). However, the version of the data transfer service that ultimately launched on Vodacom’s network did not require a fee. “Charging for data transfer was one of the options that Vodacom considered during the implementation of the regulations,” the mobile network told MyBroadband. “We took the decision to provide our customers with the option to transfer data free of charge shortly after we announced the reduction of out of bundle rates by up to 70%.” “This is in line with our commitment to reduce the cost to communicate, give customers control on what they do with their data, and to enable affordable data connectivity to all South Africans.” Transferred data on the Vodacom network is subject to certain terms and conditions. Vodacom appears to be very concerned over abuse of the system, and includes the following wording in its T&Cs: “Vodacom reserves the right to suspend the service in the event of suspected abuse where non-compliant devices (as specified by the regulating body, ICASA) are being used on the Vodacom network.” The rest of the terms and conditions are summarised below.
