Vodacom announced that it has achieved the highest BEE contributor score of Level 1. The company said it earned its Level 1 BEE status by ensuring that it exceeded its financial year targets against all the seven components of the B-BBEE scorecard. This achievement spent R2.3-billion to implement its BEE strategy, moving from Level 3 to Level 1 over a single year. “This accomplishment comes at a time when our economy is faced with many challenges,” said Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub. “It demonstrates how serious we are about being part of the transformation of South Africa and its people, especially the poor of our country.” In June 2018, Vodacom announced the largest-ever BEE transaction in the South African ICT sector, worth up to R16.4 billion. The deal cost Vodacom R1.15 billion and includes all the network’s existing BEE partners, our existing YeboYethu Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP), and a new staff scheme called Siyanda.
