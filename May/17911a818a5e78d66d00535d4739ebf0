Economist Mike Schussler has said a recent BBC report which showed that the unemployment rate in South Africa declined between 1994 and 2018 is complete fiction. The BBC report showed that the unemployment rate of black Africans declined from 43% in 1994 to 30.4% in 2018. According to the BBC report, titled “South Africa elections: Charting divides 25 years after apartheid”, five million black Africans are unemployed – but the rate is falling. Schussler responded to the report, saying the December 2018 unemployment rates are correct and from StatsSA. The 1994 rates are, however, complete fiction. “The unemployment rate for black Africans was 24.7% in 1994 from StatsSA, and not 43% as shown in the BBC article,” said Schussler. He added that the 1994 unemployment rate for whites was 3%, coloureds 17.6%, and Asians 10.2%. “In all cases the unemployment rates for 1994 increased,” Schussler said. “One is concerned when the facts are so different from what was published that they are really made up to fit the story.” “Is the BBC again involved in embedded journalism as in the Iraq war? This time for a government whose number one problem remains unemployment which got worse?” he asked. Schussler explained that StatsSA’s October Household survey was the only survey used in 1994 for official unemployment figures. The stats quoted in the BBC article, and the real stats, are shown in the charts below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304950 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BBC-640x384.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BBC-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BBC-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BBC-768x460.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BBC.jpg 789w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-304952 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Real-Stats-640x384.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Real-Stats-640x384.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Real-Stats-600x360.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Real-Stats-768x461.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Real-Stats.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
