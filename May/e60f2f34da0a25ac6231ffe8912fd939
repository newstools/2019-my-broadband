The easiest way to reduce data prices in South Africa is to give more spectrum to mobile operators – but incompetence, mismanagement, and instability at the Department of Communications has stopped this from happening. In its recent Data Services Market Inquiry, the Competition Commission said a lack of spectrum played a role in high data prices. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said the most significant obstacle to reducing input costs and, by extension, data prices is the fact that no new spectrum has been allocated in South Africa in the last 14 years. “Lengthy delays in completing the digital migration and allocating 4G spectrum has curbed the pace at which data prices could have fallen,” Joosub said. He added that the release of high-demand spectrum will help to restore investor confidence in South Africa and the growth of the economy. MTN SA CEO Godfrey Motsa said the spectrum crunch that has beset South Africa for a decade has undoubtedly hindered the health and growth of the industry. Digital dividend spectrum – the 700-800MHz band that can only be allocated once the digital migration in South Africa is completed – can play a key role to reduce data prices. By moving to a digital system and switching off the analogue one, large chunks of spectrum, called the digital dividend, will become available. Because of its lower frequency (in comparison with 2,100MHz, for example) it is excellent to provide rural and indoor LTE coverage. In the absence of digital dividend spectrum operators have had to re-farm spectrum and build significantly more towers at great expense to provide LTE services. This higher network cost is passed on to consumers in the form of more expensive data products. It is clear that releasing spectrum will help operators to roll out networks, launch new technologies like LTE-A and 5G, and reduce data prices. This raises the question as to why this has not happened. The answer is simple: ANC government incompetence. Over the last 11 years South Africa has had 11 communications ministers, many of whom have no knowledge of the industry. This, coupled with incompetence and mismanagement, has crushed the digital migration and spectrum allocation processes. The Department of Communications started its digital migration process over a decade ago and set a deadline of November 2011 for the process to be completed. The November 2011 deadline passed without any real progress, and so did the international digital migration deadline of 17 June 2015. In 2015, South Africa became part of a small list of countries that failed to even get out of the starting blocks towards digital migration. Since then it has been one missed deadline after another, while the telecoms industry is begging for additional spectrum to serve the growing demand for mobile data. Every new minister promised action, but just like their predecessors, the job has not been completed. The list below provides an overview of what has happened during the past 18 years in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-74529" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ivy-Matsepe-Casaburri.jpg" alt="Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ivy-Matsepe-Casaburri.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ivy-Matsepe-Casaburri-250x166.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Date: 2001 Minister: Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri What they said: The Minister appoints the Digital Broadcasting Advisory Board (DBAB).
