Official marketing images of the new OnePlus 7 Pro have been leaked online, providing the first look at the device’s “breakthrough” bezel-less display. Pictures of the device posted by WinFuture show that the OnePlus 7 Pro will not feature a notch to house its front-facing camera, instead relying on a sliding mechanism similar o the OnePlus 7. The bottom bezel of the device has also been greatly reduced to provide an extremely high screen-to-body ratio, and the display itself has been rumoured to include “breakthrough” features. According to WinFuture, the OnePlus 7 Pro will boast a 6.67-inch 3,120 x 1,440 AMOLED display with a refresh rate of up to 90Hz. The device will have a triple-lens rear camera and a single-lens retractable front camera, along with OnePlus’ traditional notification slider positioned on the right side of the smartphone chassis. The upcoming OnePlus 7 Pro is expected to launch on 14 May 2019.
