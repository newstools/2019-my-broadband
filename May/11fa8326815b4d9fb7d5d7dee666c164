FNB Connect has dropped the price of its Lifestyle Top Up Medium package from R139 to R99 per month, offering customers a monthly saving of R40. The mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) offers Lifestyle Top Up Medium customers a monthly allocation of 100 minutes, 300 MB of data and 100 SMSs. When compared to once-off prepaid bundles for similar allocations, a customer would spend nearly double the current price for the same value, FNB Connect said. FNB Connect added that it made this pricing change as part of its strategy to help customers with money management, which includes being efficient on mobile spend. “The Lifestyle Top Up package is a month to month package that is ideal for our traditional pre-paid customers but offers pricing normally only associated with a fixed term contract,” said FNB Connect CEO Len Pienaar. “No credit checks are required and a customer can cancel the package or change it with a month’s notice.” Pienaar added that the integration of FNB Connect in the bank’s ecosystem allows customers to actively manage both their mobile and banking accounts within the same platform. FNB Connect reported a base of approximately 700,000 users in December 2018, which it said is a firm indication that it is increasingly becoming a mobile provider of choice among FNB customers.
