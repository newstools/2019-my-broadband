The SANBS has launched a new drone blood delivery service at the North Eastern Radio Flyers in Sandton. Its Tron drone has a range of over 100km and can travel at up to 180km/h – but can also travel as slowly as 60km/h if necessary. The wing-design is incredibly efficient, added the SANBS, allowing for long travel with minimal power usage. “We had a discussion with the department of health to discuss how to help people in rural areas, and hence the drone project was born,” said SANBS CEO Dr Jonathan Louw. He said that when designing the drone, there were seven criteria: After a six-month process, the SANBS decided to partner with the organisation they deemed to be the best option: Quantum Systems. Louw said the SANBS is incredibly excited by the opportunities that this new drone delivery system offers patients in need. “We believe this will be a milestone in the history of blood transfusion, not only in South Africa, but in the entire world.” The SANBS will now conduct a series of test runs, and once the Civil Aviation Authority gives them the necessary licensing, they’ll look to expand into multiple provinces including KZN, the Western Cape, and the Eastern Cape. The Tron drone can either be controlled by a pilot or fly autonomously. Before it takes off, it conducts a series of security checks to ensure that it is ready to fly. Once these checks have been done, the drone will take off. Crucially, the Tron is designed to fly at a height that will not interfere with aeroplane traffic. The drone also relays HD-quality video to the control centre, ensuring that its flight path and trajectory can be monitored at all times. The design of Tron is such that it lands smoothly, avoiding any damage to either the drone or the blood sample – even if it needs to make an emergency landing. Pictures of the Tron can be seen below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-308020 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Drone-1-640x427.jpg" alt="Drone" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Drone-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Drone-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Drone-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Drone-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307942 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-768x513.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307946 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-drone-2-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-drone-2-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-drone-2-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-drone-2-768x513.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-drone-2.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307948 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-3-640x430.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-3-640x430.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-3-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-3-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-3-768x516.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-3.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307950 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-4-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-4-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-4-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-4-768x513.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-4.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307944" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blood-container.png" alt="" width="640" height="512" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blood-container.png 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blood-container-500x400.png 500w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blood-container-768x614.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blood-container-538x430.png 538w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-307940 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-5-640x427.png" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-5-640x427.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-5-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-5-768x513.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SANBS-Drone-5.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
