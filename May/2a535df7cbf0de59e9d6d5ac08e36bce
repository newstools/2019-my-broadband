Popular hacker forum OGusers.com has been hacked, exposing the email addresses, hashed passwords, and private message history of users, KrebsOnSecurity reports. Information for over 113,000 users was exposed in the attack, including the IP addresses of users. According to the report, OGusers is a forum popular among people who conduct SIM-swop attacks and attempt to hijack online accounts. On 12 May 2019, OGusers administrators noted that several months’ worth of information was wiped from the website’s storage, a result of attackers breaching and stealing the forum’s user database and wiping drives. A user posted all the stolen details on rival hacking community RaidForums on 16 May 2019, allowing hackers to download the information for free. “On the 12th of May 2019 the forum ogusers.com was breached [and] 112,988 users were affected,” RaidForums administrator Omnipotent posted. “I have uploaded the data from this database breach along with their website source files.”
