Microsoft announced that its Windows 10 May 2019 Update has now begun rolling out to users around the world. The update includes a number of new features, including a new light theme and Windows Sandbox, and Microsoft said the rollout of the update would be implemented gradually to minimise the potential for widespread issues. “We will be taking a measured and throttled approach, allowing us to study device health data as we increase availability via Windows Update,” the company said. Customers who are ready to install the May 2019 Update can navigate to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and select the Download and Install option. With the launch of this update, the Windows 10 April 2018 Update is approaching end of service. Windows 10 users on this update or earlier will automatically receive the May 2019 Update. “Being on the latest version of Windows 10, the May 2019 Update, provides you with the latest features, more control over updates, and greater transparency for a better update experience,” Microsoft said. “We will continue to work to improve Windows 10 quality and will be closely monitoring and sharing how the rollout is going, including both the current status and issues via the new Windows release health dashboard.”
