Boeing announced that it has completed the development of its updated 737 Max software and is now awaiting certification from the FAA. The company claimed to have tested the updated software for over 360 hours across 207 different flights and is confident that the software is ready to be implemented across its entire fleet. “With safety as our clear priority, we have completed all of the engineering test flights for the software update and are preparing for the final certification flight,” said Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. “We’re making clear and steady progress and are confident that the 737 MAX with updated MCAS software will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly.” Boeing has also developed training and educational materials in a bid to support their return to service. These are currently being reviewed by the FAA, global regulators, and airline customers. “The accidents have only intensified our commitment to our values, including safety, quality and integrity, because we know lives depend on what we do,” said Muilenburg.
