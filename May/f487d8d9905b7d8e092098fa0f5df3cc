Cell C recently announced it had “enhanced” its MediPlay offering, which comprises a range of data-focused packages. These packages include data, minutes, SMSs, Black data, and access to various Black channels. Cell C owns the Black streaming service, and subsequently offers unique access and specials for the content platform through its MediaPlay offering. However, Cell C is competing directly with other popular data-focussed packages, the most attractive of which is arguably Telkom’s FreeMe range. To see how they compare, we looked at the value Cell C MediaPlay and Telkom FreeMe products offer. The monthly data, minutes, SMSs, and monthly price for the Telkom FreeMe and Cell C MediaPlay bundles are detailed below. This comparison shows how much cheaper Telkom’s FreeMe data packages are than Cell C’s competing products. It must be noted that the table below does not include bundled extras such as Black channel availability or LIT music streaming, which offer increased value. Telkom’s FreeMe line-up has the edge over Cell C in terms of monthly data and pricing, but do the features bundled with these packages match up with MediaPlay? Cell C now includes 2GB of Black data with packages from 1.5GB – 5GB, and 4GB Black data for larger packages. MediaPlay also offers access to a number of channels on the Black streaming service, depending on which package the customer selects. On the other hand, Telkom offers FreeMe subscribers free WhatsApp messaging and calling (2GB FUP), and also bundles LIT music and video streaming with packages over 2GB in size. The LIT service allows users to stream video from platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Showmax without using their monthly data, in addition to streaming music for free. A fair usage policy of 50GB applies to this platform, but top-ups are relatively cheap once this is reached. A comparison of the add-ons offered by Cell C MediaPlay and Telkom FreeMe packages are detailed below – which shows that the LIT add-on offers better value for money for media streaming. If you want Black streaming channels, Telkom FreeMe still offers better value – as you can simply purchase a standalone Black TV Premium subscription for R99 per month.
