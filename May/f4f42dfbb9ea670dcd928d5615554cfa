Sony recently held a corporate strategy meeting where it outlined its plans to cut costs and improve profitability. The company reorganised its internal structure, moving its mobile communication division into its electronics products and solutions segment. Sony said it also planned for its mobile division to be profitable by the end of its 2020 financial year, which it would accomplish by cutting operating costs. According to a report by Xperia Blog, Sony would accomplish this by focusing on key markets while “defocusing” on other regions. Markets which were defined as non-focus regions included Africa, the Middle East, India, and Australia, with South Africa outlined as a defocused region. According to the report, Sony Mobile would slowly pull out of these regions in an effort to cut costs. A number of these regions had already seen the quiet exit of Sony Mobile, the report stated. To find out the what the latest approach was, MyBroadband spoke to Sony Mobile South Africa about the future of its business and whether the company would exit the region. Sony Mobile South Africa said it would continue business as normal, with its products being available for direct purchase in the country. “Sony Mobile South Africa has confirmed that it is business as usual,” the company told MyBroadband. Sony offers a number of smartphones in the mid and top market segments, including its new Xperia 10 range. These smartphones offer flagship-like features paired with a modern chassis design and an affordable price tag. Sony Mobile’s smartphones also boast impressive camera technology, with even its mid-range devices featuring 4K video recording capabilities.
