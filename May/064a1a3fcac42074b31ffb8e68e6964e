Webafrica has launched Telkom fixed-LTE packages which do not require users to take out a contract. The packages are available on a month-to-month basis, and users can cancel with one calendar month’s notice, said the company. Webafrica’s packages come in a range of sizes – from 20GB of Anytime data per month up to 200GB of Anytime data per month. They also include Night Surfer data, which can be used from midnight to 07:00 daily. Users will also receive a free Huawei B525 router with their LTE package, which remains the property of Webafrica. A customer is entitled to use the router for as long as their package is active. If cancelled, users may return the router or choose to purchase it. The Anytime data in the Telkom LTE packages is valid for 61 days before it expires, while Night Surfer and Top-Up data is valid for 30 days. Top-Up data is available from R2.65 per GB. The table below details the Telkom fixed-LTE packages available from Webafrica. Webafrica said that a maximum of three packages per customer are allowed, and that a delivery fee of R209 will be charged. Users will also need to RICA their SIM card with the ISP by providing the necessary documents.
