SqwidNet has partnered with Chipfox-SA to facilitate livestock tracking using IoT technology in South Africa. SqwidNet is the Sigfox operator in South Africa and provides a nationwide IoT network that allows low-cost data transmission with low power usage. “Through IoT, companies can solve industry-specific challenges and manage their assets more effectively,” said SqwidNet managing director Phathizwe Malinga. “In agriculture, for example, IoT can be applied to monitor soil moisture, air quality, and other related trends which can then be used to improve crop yields. Similarly, it is being used for tracking livestock and wild animals.” Chipfox-SA said it has extended the long-standing global partnership with Sigfox to become the go-to solution provider for livestock tracking in South Africa. The company provides a portable electronic device that uses GPS to track location, with battery facilitating up to 6 years of autonomy. “This technology allows us to gather far greater insights into animal behaviour and enable us to protect those species that need it most,” said Chipfox-SA managing director Ben Hoffman. “We plan to put Sigfox trackers on hawks as well as a few mammal species including buffalo, rhino, and cheetahs going forward,” he said.
