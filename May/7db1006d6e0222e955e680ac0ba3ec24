Sony has revealed the latest details about its next-generation console, expected to be the PlayStation 5. The console will receive new hardware, said Sony, including: This will allow the PlayStation 5 to support ray tracing and 8K graphics, said the company. It added that the PlayStation 5 will be 10-times faster than a PlayStation 4 Pro at loading complex scenes. Another standout feature is backwards-compatibility with PlayStation 4 games – including physical discs – and the PlayStation VR headset. With multiple PC and PlayStation gamers in our office, the announcement from Sony immediately caused furious debate about what will, won’t, and should happen with the PlayStation 5. The first point of contention was the “8K graphics” claim. While 8K output to a compatible display seems reasonable, gaming in 8K is unlikely. Gaming in 8K at frame rates above 30fps is even more unlikely, according to our hardcore gamers. This is due to the fact that even today’s most advanced gaming PC with the GPUs like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti are built for 4K 60fps performance. It must also be noted that this performance comes with the need for a full-size graphics card in a desktop PC, and a big wallet. The RTX 2080 Ti sells for $1,200 (R17,000) in the US. What we would like to see in the PS5, however, is consistent 60fps 4K performance in all games, with an 8K home menu being good enough for now. In addition to this, FreeSync support via the AMD hardware would be welcome. This would mean that users with FreeSync TVs and monitors could see smoother gameplay if frame rates were to drop. A 2TB SSD, as standard. This was a firm request from the ranks, as 500GB or 1TB of storage is simply not enough for those who buy most of their PlayStation games from the digital store. You do not want to delete games every time a new triple-A title comes out, especially if the download size of Red Dead Redemption 2 is anything to go by. The Rockstar Games title required 99GB to download on the PlayStation 4, along with an extra 50GB for the installation process. Other hardware requests were two controllers bundled as standard with the console – and the ability to completely turn off a controller’s light bar, if the new Dualshock units come with light bars. The PlayStation 5 is expected to launch in 2020, and more details on its rollout may be revealed at E3 2019 – which takes place in June. Perhaps the most important detail yet to be revealed, however, is the price. There have been reports that the PlayStation 5 will be sold at a loss following its launch in a bid to drive sales. This loss will covered by the continued sale of the PlayStation 4, and games for the console, for the next three years. The most expensive console on the market currently is the Xbox One X, which sells for around R8,500 in South Africa. This is the closest device we have in terms of a comparable product, although the PlayStation 5 is expected to exceed the One X by some margin when it comes to performance. When the Xbox Box One X launched locally, it sold for R7,000 as part of a launch special – and Sony may follow this route for the PS5. What actual rand figure this translates into is unknown – we are hoping for something between R8,000 to R9,999.
