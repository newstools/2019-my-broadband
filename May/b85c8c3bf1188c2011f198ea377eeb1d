Verizon’s 5G network in the United States now delivers gigabit download speeds, according to tests conducted by The Verge. According to the report, 5G coverage remains limited across certain parts of Chicago but the speeds delivered over the network are extremely impressive. Speed tests conducted on Samsung’s Galaxy S10 5G smartphone reflected download and upload speeds of 1,096Mbps and 60Mbps respectively, with a ping of 25ms. The Verge also tested out the real-world capabilities of the 5G network, downloading an episode of the Office at high quality in eight seconds and the film Iron Man 2 in a minute and a half. 5G promises unprecedented speeds, and compatible smartphones are already beginning to roll out from major manufacturers which support the technology. It will be a while before these speeds are available in South Africa however, thanks to the lack of available spectrum.
