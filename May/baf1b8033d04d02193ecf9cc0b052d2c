Point Topic has released its latest global fixed-broadband take-up forecasts, which show that fibre-to-the-home is rapidly killing ADSL across the globe. The report, titled “The next billion: markets and technologies that will drive broadband in the next decade”, shows that fibre will continue to drive broadband take-up worldwide. Between 2018 and 2025, fixed-broadband take-up in the top 30 markets is expected to grow by 22%. Global take-up is expected to grow by 24%. In the same period, fibre-based connections are expected to grow by 51% while VDSL services are expected to increase by 28%. ADSL connections, however, are expected to decline by 39% by 2025 – a consequence of the growing popularity of fibre-to-the-home services. The chart below shows the change in broadband technology market shares between 2008 and 2025. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305934 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tech-market-shares-640x418.png" alt="" width="640" height="418" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tech-market-shares-640x418.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tech-market-shares-600x392.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tech-market-shares-768x501.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tech-market-shares.png 976w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The chart below shows the forecast of global churn in fixed-broadband take-up by technology. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305930 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Churn-by-tech-640x388.png" alt="" width="640" height="388" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Churn-by-tech-640x388.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Churn-by-tech-600x363.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Churn-by-tech.png 672w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
