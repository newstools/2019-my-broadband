Microsoft plans to launch a whole new version of its Xbox Game Pass package for PC gamers, the company announced in a blog post. The company first launched Xbox Game Pass in 2017, allowing players on Xbox One to access a large library of games for a monthly fee. This Xbox Game Pass library included some Play Anywhere titles which could also be installed and played on PC, but there was no equivalent package for PC gamers to access titles on the Microsoft Store. “We researched whether a similar opportunity exists for PC players and PC game developers, and we believe that it does,” said Xbox head Phil Spencer. “We also considered the importance of bringing something new and additive to the PC gaming ecosystem, and we believe that we can.” Xbox Game Pass for PC will give subscribers access to over 100 “high-quality” PC games from over 75 developers and publishers. Spencer added that PC gamers will now also be able to purchase Xbox Game Studios from other platforms such as Steam in addition to the Microsoft Store. “Our intent is to make our Xbox Game Studios PC games available in multiple stores, including our own Microsoft Store on Windows, at their launch,” he said. “We believe you should have choice in where you buy your PC games.”
