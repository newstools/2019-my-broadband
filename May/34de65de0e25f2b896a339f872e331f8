Consumer Reports has claimed that Tesla’s automatic lane-changing technology “doesn’t work very well” and could create potential safety risks for drivers. Tesla added this new lane-changing feature to its Autopilot software last month as part of the company’s efforts to make driving more seamless. However, Consumer Reports said that in tests it has conducted, it found that the feature cuts off other cars without leaving enough space. The technology also conducted several passing maneuvers that violate road laws where the vehicle was being driven. “The system’s role should be to help the driver, but the way this technology is deployed, it’s the other way around,” says Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports’ senior director of auto testing. “It doesn’t appear to react to brake lights or turn signals, it can’t anticipate what other drivers will do, and as a result, you constantly have to be one step ahead of it.” As a result of these findings, Consumer Reports speculates that Tesla’s goal of implementing full self-driving technology by the end of 2020 is unlikely to come to fruition.
