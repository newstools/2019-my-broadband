Intel thinks that laptops with foldable displays will debut in around two years, Nikkei Asian Review reports. The company said it was working on understanding the limitations and potential of the technology, along with looking at ways the solution could improve the notebook experience. According to the report, Intel is working with display manufacturers including LG, Sharp, and Samsung to research the technology. Samsung and Huawei have led the charge in foldable hardware with their Galaxy Fold and Mate X smartphones, although these have been plagued with the issues expected in a first-generation foldable smartphone. Samsung’s Galaxy Fold encountered a number of issues when it was rolled out to reviewers, mainly around the display’s hinge failing which resulted in the panel being disabled.
