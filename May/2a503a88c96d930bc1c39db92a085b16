Smartphones are becoming increasingly expensive in South Africa, and this means that flagship devices like the latest Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S Series, or Huawei P Series smartphones can be too expensive for some users, while others will have to look for the cheapest deals available. To help local buyers find the cheapest deals on new devices, we looked at the latest flagship-series smartphones on the market from major brands including Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. We then compared the contract pricing of these devices and eliminated all packages which were priced at over R700. This would leave us with a selection of smartphone contracts which offered the latest high-end smartphones on the market at a relatively cheap price. We did not compare any contracts priced at over R700, which resulted in a number of more expensive smartphones being excluded from the comparison entirely. Current-generation smartphones which did not qualify for the comparison due to their contract prices being too high include: We also only compared 24-month contracts, excluding any packages which offered cheaper monthly pricing over a 36-month period. Vodacom offered the widest selection of discounted 36-month contracts for the flagship devices we compared, but these packages were not included due to the vast difference in total accrued payment at the end of the period. Below are the best flagship smartphone contracts available for under R700 per month in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300550" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-header.jpg" alt="Huawei P30 header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299060" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S10e" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Samsung-Galaxy-S10e-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-280157" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Huawei-Mate-20-Pro-header.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate 20 Pro header" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Huawei-Mate-20-Pro-header.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Huawei-Mate-20-Pro-header-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Huawei-Mate-20-Pro-header-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="wp-image-275281 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iPhone-Xr-1.jpg" alt="iPhone Xr 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iPhone-Xr-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iPhone-Xr-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iPhone-Xr-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293102" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LG-V40.jpg" alt="LG V40" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LG-V40.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LG-V40-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LG-V40-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
