Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Note 10 could ship without a headphone jack or any physical buttons, Android Police reports. The report said that Samsung’s next premium flagship device will have no 3.5mm connector, and its exterior physical buttons would be replaced with capacitive areas. These pressure-sensitive areas could be highlighted by a change in texture along the edge of the smartphone or small ridges on the side of the chassis. The report said that these changes could have been motivated by a drive to remove potential points of failure from the hardware, and may also be made to the company’s Galaxy S flagship lineup. A source told Android Police that Samsung also plans to launch the Galaxy Note 10 in two different sizes – offering a smaller and larger device to customers.
