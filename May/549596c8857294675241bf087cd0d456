Takealot has officially launched 25 new pickup points across, headed up by a flagship venue at the Big Bird One Stop in Midrand, Gauteng – located on the New Road off-ramp. The company has 25 pickup points across the country which offer an alternative to receiving one’s orders via delivery, and the company predicts that 10-15% of its sales will be collected at these points rather than delivered. MyBroadband spoke to the architects behind the New Road branch of the Takealot pickup point to find out more about the construction and design of the venue. The flagship pickup point was designed by Cape Town-based firm Bomax, and the project was headed up by Heinrich van Zyl. Bomax handles all interiors for Takealot including their headquarters, offices, and pick up points throughout the country. Boxmax said the main purpose of this collection point was to get the parcels to the customers as quickly as possible, and the two most important considerations were the journey of the parcel and the experience of the customer. “Having storage facilities located on the first floor presented a challenge for the flow and efficiency of the logistics but allowed an opportunity for a novel and exciting method of getting the parcels moved between floors,” Bomax said. “This was successfully and playfully addressed by the spiral conveyer belt that gets the parcel from storage to the collection desk and in the customer’s hands in under 3 minutes.” In addition to this spiral conveyer belt, the pickup point also sports a large feature wall with recreations of various products depicted in a unique design. “A feature wall was designed for the double volume space to represent the different departments of Takealot and the variety of products they offer,” Bomax said. “Each item of the feature wall was custom moulded with high density foam.” “The layout was kept simple to allow an efficient experience for the customer, but features several Takealot brand aspects such as the distinguishable blue colouring throughout,” the company said. Below are images of the Takealot New Road pickup point when it was under construction and after it was completed, courtesy of Bomax. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305280"
