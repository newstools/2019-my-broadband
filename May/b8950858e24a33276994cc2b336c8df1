The Huawei P30 Lite is arguably the best value-for-money device on the market today. At R5,999, the smartphone features a 6.15-inch high-resolution display with excellent colour, runs Android 9.0, has facial and fingerprint recognition, and packs a triple-lens rear camera system. These elements are typically reserved for flagship devices, but the Huawei P30 Lite brings them to the mid-range market thanks to its attractive price. A long battery life, courtesy of a 3,340mAh cell, and fast Wi-Fi and LTE are also standard on the device – along with a powerful HiSilicon Kirin 710 processor. More importantly, the P30 Lite looks and feels like a phone with a substantially higher price tag that what it really costs. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305398 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-640x371.jpg" alt="P30 Lite" width="640" height="371" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-640x371.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-600x348.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-768x446.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite.jpg 1051w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Huawei P30 sits in your hand in the same way a high-end Samsung or Apple smartphone would, and its front is almost entirely made up of its touchscreen – save for a small notch at the top which houses the front-facing camera. Officially, the screen-to-body ratio is 90%. Its Android operating system is skinned with Huawei’s EMUI design and presents menus and icons in a way Android users will be familiar with, meaning it not only looks like a flagship, but offers an interface which fits the device’s narrative: smooth and smart performance. The hardware specifications of the P30 Lite are listed below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305396 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-2-640x329.jpg" alt="P30 Lite" width="640" height="329" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-2-640x329.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-2-600x309.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-2-768x395.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Lite-2.jpg 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The P30 Lite is available in two colours: Midnight Black and Peacock Blue, the latter of which is the model pictured in this article. Looking at the rear of the device, the vibrant blue starts at the top and descends past the triple-lens camera and fingerprint sensor. It then mergers into an iridescent purple at the bottom, which displays subtle changes in different lighting conditions. The SIM card and microSD slot is positioned on the top-left edge of the P30 Lite, with a USB-C and headphone ports on the bottom edge. The left side of the phone is completely flush, and a “lock” button along with a volume button finish off the device’s frame on the right. The Huawei P30 Lite is available from mobile networks and local retailers, and is a great option for those who want a powerful smartphone with the latest technology, but who do not want to spend tens of thousands. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305404 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Side-640x303.jpg" alt="P30 Lite" width="640" height="303" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Side-640x303.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Side-600x285.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Side-768x364.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Side.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-305394" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Camera.jpg" alt="P30 Lite" width="640" height="447" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Camera.jpg 675w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Camera-573x400.jpg 573w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/P30-Camera-616x430.jpg 616w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This article was published in partnership with Huawei.
