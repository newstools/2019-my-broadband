Sony Interactive has launched PlayStation Productions – a new production studio that will turn popular PS4 games into movies. Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, project head Asad Qizilbash said that Sony Interactive decided to keep the making of these movies in-house because they felt they were best positioned to make successes out of these projects. “Instead of licensing our IP out to studios, we felt the better approach was for us to develop and produce for ourselves,” says Qizilbash. “One, because we’re more familiar, but also because we know what the PlayStation community loves.” Qizilbash added that they have been analysing how Marvel took its comic book range and turned them into a massive movie franchise, and they hope to replicate this with their movies. “For the last year and half, two years, we’ve spent time trying to understand the industry, talking to writers, directors, producers,” he said. “We talked to [film producers] Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Kevin Feige to really get an understanding of the industry.” Sony has an advantage over other game studios that have tried to turn their successful titles into movies. The company can use its Sony Pictures division to help with distribution, and it also has a more comprehensive catalogue of games than its competitors. PlayStation Productions doesn’t have a set schedule by which it must operate; instead, it will be allowed as much time as it needs to develop content that matches the quality of PlayStation’s video game titles.
