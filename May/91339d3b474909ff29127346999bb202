Gigabyte has launched its Aorus NVMe Gen4 SSD – one of the first solid state drives to use the new PCIe 4.0 controller. Along with its 5,000MB/s read speeds, it offers a sequential write speed of up to 4,400MB/s – which is around twice as fast as the fastest PCIe SSDs currently on the market. The Aorus NVMe Gen4 SSD comes in a M.2 2280 form factor and offers an external 2GB DDR4 external cache. It also sports a full body copper heat spreader to manage any excessive heat, which reduces temperatures by around 14%. The Aorus NVMe Gen 4 SSD comes in 1TB and 2TB models, and is only compatible with Gigabyte’s X570 motherboard and AMD’s next-generation Ryzen chips – all of which will become available in July. Gigabyte has not yet provided pricing for this new SSD.
