Cloud computing is changing every aspect of business by lowering infrastructure and communications costs, enabling safer data storage, increased productivity, and improved operations. The benefits of using cloud services are tremendous, but it can be challenging to find out what is on offer and how your company can benefit from the cloud revolution. This is why MyBroadband is hosting the 2019 Cloud Conference and Expo on 6 June 2019 at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, Gauteng. The event showcases the latest cloud products from local and international companies, and features top speakers to tell you more about the journey into the cloud. It is the premier cloud event in South Africa and is a must-attend event for every ICT manager and executive.
