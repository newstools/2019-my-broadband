Steve Hofmeyr posted a video on Facebook where he cancelled his DStv account, destroyed his DStv decoder by driving over it, and took his satellite dish off his roof. This followed MultiChoice’s decision to remove all content featuring Hofmeyr from DStv, Showmax, and the audio channels it controls. MultiChoice Group Executive for Corporate Affairs Joe Heshu explained that the company’s decision is based on the fact that Hofmeyr’s views are not aligned with MultiChoice’s values. “We welcome a society where freedom of speech is celebrated, however we take a stand against racism,” said Heshu. Hofmeyr hit back against MultiChoice’s decision, saying the company is now aligning itself with the state which is corrupt and racist. “White people, their language, and their cultural heritage have become playthings for the fascists,” he said. Hofmeyr said that he has provided a lot of content to MultiChoice and he will be looking to move his content elsewhere. Hofmeyr offered a R10,000 cash prize to encourage people to follow his lead and cancel their DStv subscription. He said he cannot boycott everything and everyone who takes a stand against him, but added that he will try. “I am finished with MultiChoice, all their channels, including Kyknet and Showmax, as well as Media24,” he said. Hofmeyr encouraged his followers to get access to the Internet, invest in an Android TV box, and subscribe to a streaming TV service. Hofmeyr posted the video embedded below on Facebook.
