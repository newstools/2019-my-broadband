Vodacom is on a digital transformation journey which will require skills and expertise in big data, artificial intelligence, and robotic process automation. The company told MyBroadband that there is a scarcity of these three skills, not only in South Africa but across the world. While the company is doing its best to acquire these skills, it is also collaborating with its partners to ensure a self-sustaining approach when dealing with the scarcity. While skills form a core part of Vodacom’s recruitment process, the company is also looking for a good cultural fit. “We look for people who are excited about driving business transformation and making an impact in society,” Vodacom said. “We also look for people who have the potential to identify and align with our organisation’s purpose of connecting for a better future.” Vodacom’s advice to job seekers is to be curious about the future and to think about the impact that you can make on society. “Make a deliberate choice to work with companies, individuals, or people who have a deep interest in making a difference in society,” Vodacom said. Vodacom added that a deliberate attempt to keep learning and reskilling yourself is a great way to stay ahead in the capability game.
