Although we’re moving deeper and deeper into the fourth industrial revolution, the use of printers and physical documents in the workplace is nowhere near obsoletion. In fact, recent data shows that the average U.S. Office Worker uses up to 10,000 sheets of paper per annum. The IDC has also found that between 5% and 15% of an average business’ annual revenue is allocated to document costs.
