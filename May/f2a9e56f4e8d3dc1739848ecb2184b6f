Huawei Mobile South Africa said it will continue to provide security updates and services for all existing smartphones and tablets. This statement follows Google’s announcement earlier this month that it has cut off Huawei’s Android licence. Huawei has also been barred from the SD Association, meaning it will no longer be able to sell products which support official SD and microSD card standards. Google and the SD Association’s decisions are a result of the United States’ strict limitation which it imposed on its technology trade with China. While the United States Bureau of Industry and Security has issued a temporary licence to Huawei to retain support for its existing products, the long-term impact can be significant. Unless a deal is struck between the US and China which will see the ban on trade lifted, Huawei will have to look for a different operating system to replace Android for its smartphones and tablets. Huawei Mobile South Africa thanked its customers for their support and told them they will continue to receive support for their devices. “Thank you to all our loyal customers for being understanding and showing your unconditional support over the past week since the Android news,” Huawei said. “Huawei will continue to provide security updates and services for all existing smartphones and tablets.” It previously told MyBroadband that it will also continue to provide after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products. The company added that it will continue to work on developing a secure and sustainable software ecosystem to provide the best possible user experience worldwide. Huawei said it will continue to provide updates on the situation as new developments emerge.
