WhatsApp is working to implement a new feature which will allow users to share their status updates to Facebook, WaBetaInfo reports. Once this feature is added, users who have Facebook installed on their smartphone and post a status update on WhatsApp will be presented with an “Add to Facebook Story” option. Selecting this option will redirect you to Facebook to share your story on the social media platform. This feature will not automatically share any statuses, requiring manual authorisation from the user. Another feature coming to both Android and iOS versions of WhatsApp is the ability to add contacts by scanning an in-app QR code on their device, the report stated. Both of these features are currently under development and there is no information when they will be officially released.
