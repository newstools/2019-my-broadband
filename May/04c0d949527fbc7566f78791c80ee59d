Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has said his company is ready for a clash with the US government. The South China Morning Post reported that Zhengfei said the clash with the US was inevitable, as Huawei threatens US interests. “We sacrificed [the interests of] individuals and families for the sake of an ideal, to stand at the top of the world,” said Zhengfei. “For this ideal, there will be conflict with the United States sooner or later.” The United States has imposed strict limitations on its technology trade with China, with Huawei directly affected by the crackdown. The US government has essentially blacklisted Huawei and in the process ordered Google to revoke its Android licence – a move which has serious implications for Huawei’s smartphone business. Huawei has also been blocked from buying hardware and software from companies like Intel and Qualcomm – leaders in the chip market. Zhengfei said Huawei’s HiSilicon unit, which produces its smartphone chips, has been prepared for a US ban on hardware purchases for some time, though. Huawei has also previously stated that it is working on its own operating system in the event it was prohibited from using Android. In the interim, however, the US has issued a temporary licence to Huawei to retain support for its existing products. While Huawei’s smartphones look at risk of losing support from Google, Zhengfei said the US ban will not affect the company’s 5G network plans and that “its rivals cannot catch up” to where it is.
