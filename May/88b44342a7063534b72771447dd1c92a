Vodacom is in the process of acquiring IoT.nxt, a development company that delivers software and hardware solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT.nxt was founded by Nico Steyn in 2015 and quickly grew to become a leading provider of IoT solutions in South Africa. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said the acquisition will help the company to enhance its IoT offering. He explained that IoT.nxt offers unique edge technology and a tech-agnostic platform which can play a significant role in solving the challenges of legacy systems that have integration limitations. This acquisition, Joosub said, will position Vodacom well in being the digitalisation partner of choice for customers. Steyn told MyBroadband that the acquisition of the company will not change the way it operates, and they will maintain their agility in the market. The IoT.nxt brand will also remain, added Steyn. IoT.nxt currently has numerous clients in the South African IT and telecoms market, including Telkom, Cell C, Fastnet and T-Systems. “Our brand stays the same, and we are still able to do business with anyone,” said Steyn. Besides a capital injection, the deal with Vodacom will give the company strategic leverage – including access to Vodacom and Vodafone’s global operations, concluded Steyn.
