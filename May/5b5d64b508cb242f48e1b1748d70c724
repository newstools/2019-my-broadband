HMD Global has launched its new Nokia 1 Plus budget smartphone in South Africa. The device is one of the first smartphones running Android 9 Go to be released, and it aims to deliver mid-range smartphone features at an attractive price point. “With the Nokia 1 Plus our vision is to deliver exceptional value for money with a bigger screen and a high-quality distinctive design,” said HMD Global South Africa general manager Shaun Durandt. “The improved screen display and better viewing experience will allow you to enjoy your favourite apps and shows on the go.” “With the added benefit of Google Assistant Go – your own AI voice assistant allows you to ask questions, set reminders, and give it tasks, all by simply talking to it,” Durandt said. The Nokia 1 Plus features an auto-focus rear camera and a new front-facing camera, and is powered by a quad-core MediaTek CPU running the newest version of Android Go. Android 9 Go is a version of the full Android 9 operating system which features lightweight versions of applications and fewer storage and memory requirements. The Nokia 1 Plus will be available in two colours – Blue and Black – from 1 May 2019 for a recommended retail price of R1,499. HMD Global said that the Nokia 1 Plus would initially only be available from Vodacom outlets, with the device becoming available through selected MTN outlets later in May. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-304838" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nokia-1-Plus-Blue.jpg" alt="Nokia 1 Plus Blue" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nokia-1-Plus-Blue.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nokia-1-Plus-Blue-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nokia-1-Plus-Blue-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
