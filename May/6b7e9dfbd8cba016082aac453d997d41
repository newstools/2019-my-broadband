Google announced that it will launch an updated version of its Google Glass augmented reality spectacles targeted at businesses. The Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1 chipset, which includes a multi-core CPU and a new AI engine. “This enables significant power savings, enhanced performance and support for computer vision and advanced machine learning capabilities,” said Google. The new Google Glass product also features a superior camera, better battery life, and a USB Type-C port for faster charging. These smart spectacles are built on Android, which Google said will make it easier to integrate services and APIs into this new product. “We’re committed to providing enterprises with the helpful tools they need to work better, smarter and faster,” said Google. “We’re excited to see how our partners and customers will continue to use Glass to shape the future of work.” <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-307020" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Glass_Enterprise_Edition_2.max-1000x1000-640x355.png" alt="Glass_Enterprise_Edition_2.max-1000x1000" width="640" height="355" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Glass_Enterprise_Edition_2.max-1000x1000-640x355.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Glass_Enterprise_Edition_2.max-1000x1000-600x333.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Glass_Enterprise_Edition_2.max-1000x1000-768x426.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Glass_Enterprise_Edition_2.max-1000x1000.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
