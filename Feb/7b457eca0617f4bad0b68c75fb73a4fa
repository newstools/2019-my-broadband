TechRadar reports there could be fewer than 200 AMD Radeon VII GPUs available in the UK when it releases – which is set to take place today. Overclockers UK’s purchasing manager Andrew Gibson said his company has slightly under 100 cards and they are the “largest stockist in Europe”. Meanwhile, there are reportedly only 20 Radeon VIIs in France, and a only 20 in Spain. While there is no official word from AMD regarding any shortage of stock, these rumours will leave many prospective customers worried – including those in South Africa, where there is no trace of the card. Some have speculated that the rumoured lack of stock has been caused by the Lunar New Year in China, with many factories closing down for this celebration. AMD previously said there will not be a shortage of Radeon VII GPUs upon release, after previous reports suggested it only had 5,000 units ready for shipping. The Radeon VII is priced at $699 in the US, and no pricing has been released for South Africa.
