Apple is likely to release a new MacBook Pro in 2019, speculates analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in a leaked research document. Kuo expects that the new MacBook Pro will have a display sized at 16.5-inches, which would be larger than any MacBook Pro released in the past six years. He added that there will also possibly be a 13-inch version released this year that will be the first MacBook Pro of this size to support 32GB of RAM. Kuo also believes that Apple will release a 31.6-inch 6K monitor for the Mac Pro, with a backlit display design using Mini LEDs. Apple’s marketing VP Phil Schiller previously said that while Apple last produced a display in 2016, it was working on a new one to work with its new Mac Pro. Kuo also speculates that Apple will release 5.8-inch OLED, 6.1-inch LCD, and 6.5-inch iPhones with triple-cameras and an upgraded battery later this year.
