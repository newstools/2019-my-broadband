ICASA has made slight amendments to the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter, which is set to be implemented on 28 February 2019. The regulations require mobile operators to roll over unused data, prevent automatic out-of-bundle data usage, and allow for data transfer between customers. ICASA said the amendments mainly relate to usage notifications and out-of-bundle billing. The changes require that mobile operators provide consumers with an option to opt out of usage depletion notifications for voice, SMS, and data services. Additionally, networks must provide consumers with an option to opt in or opt out of out-of-bundle data billing. ICASA highlighted the fact that these regulations do not apply to MVNOs, resellers, or other non-licensees.
