Kenneth Makate’s legal team has served Vodacom with correspondence stating that he is taking their CEO’s R49-million offer “on judicial review”. This is according to Vodacom’s chief officer of legal and regulatory affairs Nkateko Nyoka, who was speaking to the SABC. The constitutional court ordered Vodacom in 2016 to “commence negotiations in good faith with Kenneth Nkosana Makate for determining a reasonable compensation” for his involvement in the Please Call Me service. The court further ordered Vodacom’s CEO to determine a “reasonable compensation payable to him” in the event that negotiations between the parties failed. Vodacom argues that it has followed the Constitutional Court order and that it now considers the matter as settled and closed. Makate, however, does not share this view and described the Vodacom CEO’s offer as “shocking and an insult”.
