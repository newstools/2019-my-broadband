Google Chrome 73 will be the first version of the browser to support multimedia keys on keyboards, reports ZDNet. This will allow users to control their audio and video content in the browser by using specialised buttons on certain keyboards. Chrome will not allow users to control their media at a tab level – rather, pressing play or pause will control all media within the browser, regardless of which tab is open. The upcoming feature is already available to Chrome 73 Beta and Chrome Canary users to test with YouTube. Chrome 73 is expected to release next month, and will initially launch on Chrome OS, macOS, and Windows. Linux support will become available at a later date. The current version of the browser, Chrome 72, was released on 30 January 2019 and focused on security and stability.
