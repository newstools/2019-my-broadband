Tesla has launched its new Sentry Mode feature, which uses the vehicle’s external cameras to monitor its surroundings. If enabled, the Sentry Mode system will enter a standby mode when the Tesla vehicle is left unattended. If a minor threat is detected – such as someone leaning on the vehicle – the system will switch to an “alert” mode, displaying a message on the touchscreen that warns the person they are being recorded. The final mode, which takes place if a major threat occurs – such as a broken window – will active the Tesla’s alarm, increase the display’s brightness, and play music at maximum volume. Additionally, the vehicle’s owner will receive an alert on their Tesla mobile app, which will notify them of the incident. They will also be able to access video footage of the incident – beginning 10 minutes before the event took place – if they insert a USB drive before enabling Sentry Mode. “While no alarm system can prevent against all vehicle thefts, break-ins and threats, we hope that with Sentry Mode and our other security features, your Tesla will be even more secure,” said Tesla. The feature is rolling out to Model 3 vehicles from today, and will soon be extended to Model S and Model X vehicles built after August 2017.
