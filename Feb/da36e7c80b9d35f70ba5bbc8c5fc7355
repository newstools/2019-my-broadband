Qualcomm has unveiled its new 5G chipset for PCs at MWC 2019 in Barcelona. The new Snapdragon 8cx 5G PC platform includes the company’s X55 modem, which will allow notebook manufacturers to produce laptops with 5G network capabilities. “This new PC platform will impact consumers, small businesses, the enterprise, and those on-the-go by enabling multi-gigabit connectivity, multi-day battery life, and performance computing in a modern device,” Qualcomm said. The 7nm chipset aims to combine smartphone-like functionality with the power of a premium light PC to offer performance and high-speed connectivity. Qualcomm said the addition of 5G capabilities to PCs will enhance the experience of online applications, from cloud storage and computing to gaming. The Snapdragon 8cx 5G is currently sampling to customers and is expected to be in commercial devices in late 2019.
