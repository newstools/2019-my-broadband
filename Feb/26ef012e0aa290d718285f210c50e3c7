WhatsApp is working on a new feature to improve its chat search function, WABetaInfo reports. Advanced Search will improve the standard search tool within WhatsApp, allowing users to search through multiple types of messages. Users will be able to filter their search by photos, GIFs, videos, documents, links, and audio, and the interface will reflect how many media files are stored in WhatsAppâ€™s storage. Search history will also be stored in the application and can be deleted at the press of a button. The new functionality will reportedly be made accessible to any iOS Testflight beta programme members in future iOS updates. The report added that this feature will also launch for the Android version of WhatsApp later this year.
