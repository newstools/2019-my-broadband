Huawei has unveiled the date of its P30 Series smartphone announcement on Twitter. A video posted by the company stated that the Huawei P30 will be revealed on 26 March 2019 in Paris, one month after Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

There is currently little information available regarding the specifications and features of the Huawei P30, but rumours point to in-display fingerprint sensors, optical zoom cameras, and 5G modems. Huawei did not provide any information regarding its upcoming flagship smartphones, but the teaser video was published alongside the caption “Rules were made to be rewritten”.
