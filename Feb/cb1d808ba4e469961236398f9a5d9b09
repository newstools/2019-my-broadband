The PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch are the current gaming consoles of choice. The Sony and Microsoft consoles come in multiple variants, but can each be broken down into two product lines: the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro, and the Xbox One and Xbox One X. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (including the Xbox One S) are the “base” consoles, while the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X offer improved hardware to produce better visuals and performance. Nintendo’s Switch does not have a “pro” version, but those who buy the device have a range of colour and bundle options to choose from.
