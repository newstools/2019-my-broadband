Home Affairs staff who work with clients are banned from using cellphones to ensure their quality of work is not impacted. The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs welcomed the banning of phone use at work, which was agreed to by all relevant stakeholders, including labour unions. “It is now clear that the usage of cellphones is banned and clients must not be faced with this challenge when they seek services at the Department of Home Affairs,” said Committee Chairperson Hlomani Chauke. The committee has encouraged citizens to continue monitoring and reporting bad service by Department of Home Affairs’ officials. This will enable the department to identify employees who are undermining the delivery of the department’s mandate. The department has assured the committee that it has undertaken a review of departmental policy on frontline employees’ cellphone use with stakeholders. While it welcomed the no-cellphone rule, the committee said it is concerning that there is no adherence to policy – which points to lax management. It has called for the strengthening of management, especially at an office level, as it is there that clients receive service.
