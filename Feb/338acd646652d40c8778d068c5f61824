South African-born and Silicon Valley-based mobile technology company Clickatell has made three new appointments to its board – including Michael Jordaan as chairman. Jordaan is joined by non-executive directors Willem van Biljon and Ryno Blignaut. “Our new appointments are a mix of technologists and financial services experts. Michael Jordaan has first-hand knowledge of the needs and challenges of mobile banking through his investment in the app-driven bank Bank Zero,” said Clickatell CEO Pieter de Villiers. “We will benefit from the tremendous insight offered by Willem. His experience scaling up infrastructure and serviceability at global technology companies is vital for us at this stage of our business. Ryno understands the complexities of global regulations across multiple geographies and has experience managing a global business footprint.” The appointments come at a time when Clickatell plans to build on a 30% year-on-year organic growth across its regions of global operations, the company said. “We see chat banking and chat commerce growing rapidly around the world. Our board’s collective global experience along with our leadership team’s on-the-ground emerging market success gives us an edge enjoyed by very few companies.”
