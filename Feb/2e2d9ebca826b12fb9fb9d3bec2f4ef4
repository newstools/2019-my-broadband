MultiChoice has announced its annual price adjustment for DStv, with the fees of several packages set to increase from 1 April. In 2018, the subscription fee of DStv Premium increased by 2.53%, while Statistics SA pegged inflation for 2017 at 5.3%. This year, for the first time since it launched, the price of DStv Premium will not increase. “From 1 April, DStv will freeze the price of DStv Premium subscription packages, which means customers will pay the same for their packages in the next year,” said MultiChoice. “We understand that times are tough in South Africa, and that our customers are under pressure to make every cent they spend count.” MultiChoice will be increasing the price of its Access Fee, however, the amount you pay to access services such as Catch Up, personal video recording, and XtraView on your DStv decoder. The Access Fee will increase from R90 to R95. This is a 5.56% increase, which is higher than Statistics SA’s average inflation rate for 2018 of 4.7%. Other DStv packages which did not receive a prize freeze for 2019, but above-inflation increases instead, include DStv Family, which saw a 6.4% increase from R249 to R265 per month, and DStv Access, which increased by 6.1% from R99 to R105. The price increases for DStv Compact Plus (2%) and DStv Compact (3.6%) are below the average inflation rate Statistics SA reported for 2018. DStv EasyView remained unchanged at R29, while DStv Select – only available to existing customers – went from R249 to R265 (6.4%). The graph below shows the price of DStv Premium plotted against inflation since 2000. It shows that the rate of increase of the DStv Premium subscription fee is now well below inflation, thanks in part to the prize freeze instituted by MultiChoice for 2019.
