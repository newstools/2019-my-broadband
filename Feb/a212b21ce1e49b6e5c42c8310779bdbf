Garmin shares rallied 17 percent to their highest level in 11 years as demand for watches from outdoor enthusiasts helped fourth-quarter earnings beat the highest estimates. “Their smart wearable business is on fire,” Tigress Financial Partners Chief Investment Officer Ivan Feinseth said in a phone interview. “They are becoming a leader in fitness wearables.” Revenue from Garmin’s outdoor segment increased 25 percent in the quarter “with significant contributions from adventure watches,” the company said in a statement Wednesday. Garmin forecast 2019 revenue of about $3.5 billion, surpassing the $3.43 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The consumer-electronics maker also highlighted the launch of new products including Descent, a watch for divers. Garmin shares have long been undervalued by the Street, according to Feinseth. “This move is well-deserved.” Competitors also rose after the report, with Fitbit Inc. increasing as much as 3.8 percent, Fossil Group Inc. adding as much as 2 percent. Feinseth is also bullish on Garmin’s announcement last week that it will buy Tacx, a closely held Dutch company that makes indoor bike trainers. Feinseth called it an “incredible acquisition” and sees the combination of Tacx and Garmin’s fitness-tracking technology as a “serious competitor to Peloton.”
