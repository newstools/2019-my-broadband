Hetzner has announced the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) figures for its data centre in Samrand, Midrand. PUE is a widely-accepted benchmark in the data centre industry to help determine how energy efficient an installation is. The highest level of energy efficiency is awarded a PUE score of 1.2, with the industry average being 1.7. Hetzner’s Samrand data centre scored 1.21. “When we built the Samrand DC in 2013, it was really important for us to find an efficient and sustainable way of managing power consumption while making every effort to reduce its carbon footprint,” says Hetzner brand manager Athena Turner. “We make every effort to reduce power usage and pass on that cost-saving to our customers.” Hetzner said that it does not sacrifice performance for energy efficiency, and has found ways to deliver both performance and effective energy usage. “We may have added more customers and more servers, but we’ve kept our PUE score consistently low,” said Turner.
