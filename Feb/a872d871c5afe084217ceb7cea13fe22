Samsung has started producing a 512GB smartphone storage chip that offers double the speeds of its previous chip. The embedded Universal Flash Storage (eUFS) 3.0 chip will offer read speeds of 2,100MB/s – four-times faster than a SATA SSD. The eUFS 3.0 chip also offers write speeds of 410MB/s, which is similar to the write speeds of SATA SSDs. “Beginning mass production of our eUFS 3.0 line-up gives us a great advantage in the next-generation mobile market,” said Cheol Choi, executive VP of Memory Sales at Samsung. The chip will be used in future Samsung smartphones, including the upcoming Galaxy Fold. Samsung said it will release a 128GB version alongside the 512GB version this month, while it plans on releasing 256GB and 1TB versions later this year.
