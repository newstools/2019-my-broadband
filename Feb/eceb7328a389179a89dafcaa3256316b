MultiChoice has announced that it will “freeze the price” of DStv Premium from 1 April 2019, ensuring customers will pay the same rate for their package. The announcement was part of a media release which stated that MultiChoice will increase the prices of certain DStv packages from 1 April. “DStv has announced that it will be adjusting some of the prices of its subscription packages from 1 April 2019. However, Africa’s leading video entertainment company has managed to keep the average increase below consumer inflation levels,” said MultiChoice. “From 1 April, DStv will freeze the price of DStv Premium subscription packages, which means customers will pay the same for their packages in the next year.” Customers on other packages will get a minimal increase, below inflation, it added. “We have a fantastic content line-up for the year ahead and would like as many customers as possible to be able to enjoy DStv,” said MultiChoice. “We understand that times are tough in South Africa, and that our customers are under pressure to make every cent they spend count. As such, we’re keeping DStv as affordable and accessible as possible to as many households as we can, to ensure they can enjoy great entertainment for their families.” The packages affected by price increases, and the amount they are going up by, were not detailed by MultiChoice at the time of publication. MyBroadband has asked if these figures can be shared. Currently, DStv Premium costs R809 per month, excluding the complementary Access Fee of R90. DStv Compact Plus and DStv Compact currently cost R509 and R385 per month respectively, while DStv Family, DStv Access, and DStv EasyView cost R249, R99, and R29 per month respectively.
