LG has released the G8 ThinQ smartphone as it seeks to compete with flagship devices from the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. The G8 ThinQ’s standout feature is its Air Motion technology, which allows users to interact with their screen by moving their hand in front of its Z-Camera. rather than actually touching the screen. Hand ID is another new feature, and uses a 3D biometric sensor system that scans the palm of your hand to unlock your phone. The third of the standout features of the G8 ThinQ is its new Crystal Sound OLED audio system. Instead of using a standard speaker at the top of the smartphone, the G8 ThinQ uses the OLED display to direct sound towards you – theoretically ensuring better sound performance. The LG G8 ThinQ sports a 6.1-inch, 3,120 x 1,440 OLED display and packs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor – keeping up with other 2019 flagship smartphones. The G8 ThinQ also packs 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage, a rear-mounted fingerprint reader as an additional biometric security option, and a 3,500mAh battery. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297312" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-3.png" alt="LG ThinQ G8 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-3.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-3-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-3-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297314" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8.png" alt="LG ThinQ G8" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297316" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-2.png" alt="LG ThinQ G8 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-ThinQ-G8-2-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
