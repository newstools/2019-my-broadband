HMD Global has unveiled its latest high-end Nokia smartphone – the Nokia 9 PureView. The smartphone is the first in the world to have a 5-camera system on the rear, all of which are 12MP sensors with Zeiss optics. “Every picture taken with a Nokia 9 PureView is in HDR, five cameras simultaneously capture the image and fuse it together into one 12MP photo with outstanding dynamic range and depth of field,” said the company. The device is aimed at photographers and enthusiasts, and shoots photos in RAW format. It also features support for the Adobe Lightroom mobile app, so you can edit photos on the phone. Three of the camera sensors on the rear of the device are monochrome, with the remaining two colour sensors. When a photo is taken, the phone’s coprocessor captures all the images and puts them together – creating a single image. This allows for better noise reduction and decreased power usage, along with a 12MP depth map for enhanced depth of field control. The phone’s Pro Camera UI has been upgraded, too, and allows for exposure time of up to 10 seconds when shooting. Other standout features of the phone include a body made from 6000 Series aluminium, an IP67 rating, Gorilla Glass housing a 5.99-inch QHD+ OLED display, and 6GB of RAM. The device also supports wireless charging, 128GB of internal storage, and runs Android 9.0. HMD Global added that the Nokia 9 PureView measures only 8mm thick and does not contain a camera bump on the rear. Retail pricing for the phone will start at $699. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297218" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Cameras.jpg" alt="Nokia 9" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Cameras.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Cameras-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Cameras-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297222" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image-2.jpg" alt="Nokia 9" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297224" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-PureVIew.jpg" alt="Nokia 9" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-PureVIew.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-PureVIew-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-PureVIew-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-297226 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image-640x256.jpg" alt="Nokia 9" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image-640x256.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image-600x240.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image-768x307.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Nokia-9-Image.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
