Engen’s new “Big Bird” 1-Stop has just undergone a major revamp and now offers a range of new stores. Situated on the N1 South in Midrand, Engen Big Bird now offers customers an Engen Quickshop, Wimpy, Corner Bakery, Andiccio 24, Kauai, KFC, Woolworths Foodstop, and Schoon Bakery. Additionally, there are a variety of ATMs available, which cater to Absa, Standard Bank, and FNB customers. “We would like to thank our loyal customers for their patience and incredible support over the past year, during the revamp,” said Engen Big Bird owner Nicola Bird. “We are really looking forward to this additional new offering and we know our customers are looking forward to having a Woolworths Foodstop and all the other new convenience offerings.” Additionally, Takealot is completing a new customer centre in the complex, which will allow customers to collect their packages directly – a service previously only offered to Cape Town customers. Photos of the completed Engen Big Bird and Takealot facilities, which are still under construction, can be found below.
