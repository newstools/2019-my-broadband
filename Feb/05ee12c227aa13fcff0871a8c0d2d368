Showmax announced it is now offering a free two-month trial for DStv Compact and Compact Plus customers. From 7 February until 7 April 2019, qualifying subscribers who add Showmax to their DStv bill will receive a two-month free trial of the service. If these subscribers choose to continue after the two-month period they will only be charged R49 per month – instead of the standard R99 monthly rate. To begin the trial, Compact and Compact Plus subscribers can go to the streaming service’s website and sign up with their South African ID number. After authenticating via SMS, subscribers will be able to download the Showmax app and begin watching. Customers can cancel their Showmax subscription at any time, including during the trial period.
