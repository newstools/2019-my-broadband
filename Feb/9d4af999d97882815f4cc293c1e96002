Global IoT services provider Eseye has partnered with MTN and the new AnyNet Federation to meet the demands of IoT customers. The AnyNet Federation aims make the global IoT landscape easier to navigate for AWS customers by deploying a single cellular M2M solution that can be implemented globally. Using the AnyNet Secure for AWS SIM card, AnyNet Federation customers will experience connectivity that integrates into AWS IoT Core and is globally scalable, the companies said. Regardless of which AnyNet Federation partner is delivering the data, the customer is billed through their account by AWS – and the network operator is paid for the services it delivers. “This is a ground-breaking global collaboration,” said Eseye CEO Nick Earle. “The AnyNet Secure is already the most feature rich and integrated connectivity solution for AWS.” “MTN is delighted to bring their networks across 12 markets to the support the objectives of the AnyNet Federation,” said MTN group enterprise executive Oliver Fortuin. “We believe that through collaboration we can speed up the deployment of our customers’ global IoT and enhance their global business opportunities.”
