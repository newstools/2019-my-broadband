The 91st Academy Awards ceremony took place last night, with the biggest names in the film industry in attendance. There was no official host this year, following controversy around the appointment of Kevin Hart â€“ who backed out of the role due to public outcry. Despite this, the event proceeded as normal and began with a comedy routine from Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey, and Amy Poehler. The award for Best Picture was won by Green Book, while Rami Malek and Olivia Colman took home awards for Best Actor and Actress in a Leading Role respectively.
