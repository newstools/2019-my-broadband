Metrofibre Networx (MFN) has launched Aitsa.com, an ISP that will focus on providing connectivity (fibre and ADSL) services to the Afrikaans market.  According to the head of Aitsa.com, Cornelius Jansen van Rensburg, this ISP is the most recent initiative of MFN, after its 2018 launch of Gigago.co.za. “Aitsa.com is about embracing the diversity of South Africa. We believe that every South African should be able to partake in the economy and receive products and services in the same language in which they think, dream and speak. The purpose of the Aitsa.com project is not just to sell a service, but to actively support the inclusive promotion of Afrikaans within a multi-lingual context. Aitsa.com has also launched a bursary fund aimed at assisting deserving and needy young South Africans,” Jansen van Rensburg said. Like its counterpart Gigago, Aitsa.com will provide value for money. The ISP will provide 100% uncapped, unshaped, and unthrottled packages from R659 per month. Fibre prices normally vary significantly between network providers, which makes it difficult for customers to discern the differences in quality of service and value of money. Aitsa.com resolves this problem through its standard pricing model. An Aitsa.com client, whether in Cape town, Pretoria, Johannesburg or Bloemfontein, will get the same service at the same price. The simple 3-step sign-up process will allow Aitsa.com customers to check whether there is fibre in the area, choose a package which suits them, and click to complete the order.  Fibre users will be able to download music, stream videos and play online games to their hearts’ delight. Aitsa.com is available on the Openserve and Metrofibre infrastructure, and will soon be available on all other networks. For more information go to www.aitsa.com.
