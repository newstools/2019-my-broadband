Canon’s compact PowerShot G series cameras deliver premium quality in the palm of your hand. This is thanks to its 1.0 type sensor and superior DIGIC processing. The EOS-1D X Mark II features the DIGIC 7 processor, which provides superior image quality straight from the camera, reducing the need to edit photos thanks to Auto Lighting Optimiser and Diffraction Correction. For the more adventurous photographer, the Dual Pixel CMOS AF delivers precise and rapid focus in just 0.09 seconds, giving the level of responsiveness, speed and confidence needed for capturing a spontaneous shot at a moment’s notice. For those facing more challenging conditions, as an increased level of protection against dust and moisture, the camera features weather sealing for durable performance.  The flagship PowerShot G1 X Mark III is a killer combination of Canon’s EOS DSLR image quality with the handling and compact size of a PowerShot. With legendary heritage, the G1 X Mark III is perfect for today’s enthusiast photographer seeking to subtly capture boundless moments whilst on the move. The PowerShot G1 X Mark III supports the hassle-free capture of Full HD 60p movies in MP4 with smooth, stable filming and can be twinned with an optional waterproof casing to be used underwater up to a depth of 40 m (130 feet) – great for creative deep-water photography projects. The PowerShot G1 X Mark III is packed with a range of connectivity features, such as Wi-Fi and Dynamic NFC, to easily connect with compatible smart devices through a single tap.  Canon’s latest range of G series cameras such as the G1 X Mark III, the PowerShot G7 X Mark II, PowerShot G3 X, PowerShot G5 X and G9 X Mark II are ideal for photographers looking for an all-in-one alternative to a DSLR as a photographic companion. Proving the resilience of this range, an older Canon PowerShot G12 camera was found in 2018 after being lost at sea for over three years. The camera, which was lost by a Japanese student while scuba diving, was discovered in its waterproof case in working condition and with battery charge remaining. The original photos have since been returned to the owner. Read more here.
