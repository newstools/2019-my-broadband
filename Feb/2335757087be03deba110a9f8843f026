Point Topic has released its Q4 2018 residential broadband tariff report, which shows that South Africa has very affordable entry-level services, but very high average broadband prices. Point Topic’s scorecard compares the entry-level, median, and average residential broadband tariffs in 82 countries. To provide an easy way to compare prices, Point Topic took the PPP data on entry-level, median, and average broadband tariffs, produced rankings, and then compared the variance. According to the report, Venezuela, Iran, and the Ukraine have the most affordable broadband services, while Mauritania, Oman, and the UAE are the most expensive. South Africa ranks close to the bottom of the scorecard when it comes to the cheapest average and median prices of fixed-broadband products. This means that most South Africans pay higher prices for their ADSL, VDSL, and fibre connections than their counterparts in other countries. South Africa’s average broadband price is also higher than certain African countries, including Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya. Some good news is that South Africa has very affordable entry-level broadband prices, where it is ranked at number 8. As part of its latest ranking system, Point Topic included variance to indicate how different ranks for the different metrics are spread. This shows the difference between entry-level, average, and high-end broadband packages in a country. With a score of 1,141, South Africa has the second-highest variance in the world – slightly lower than Poland on 1,157. The lowest variance of 0 is found in Iran and Venezuela, where there is not a wide range of fixed-broadband products. Point Topic’s broadband tariff country scorecard is shown below, with the countries at the top of the chart offering the best median tariffs.
