The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti has been launched, with prices starting at around R5,000 in South Africa. Nvidia officially unveiled the card after launching its RTX 2060, RTX 2070, and RTX 2080 GPUs 2018. The GTX 1660 Ti does not pack all the advanced features which come with the RTX cards – such as ray tracing – but promises powerful performance. “The GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is built with the breakthrough graphics performance of the award-winning Turing architecture. With performance that rivals the GeForce GTX 1070, it’s a blazing-fast supercharger for today’s most popular games, and even faster with modern titles,” said Nvidia. The specifications of the card are below. Good news for South Africans is that local PC retailers Evetech, Wootware, and Rebel Tech have already listed local pricing for the new card. Prices start at around R5,000, and multiple manufacturers have versions on offer. Pricing from the retailers is shown below.
