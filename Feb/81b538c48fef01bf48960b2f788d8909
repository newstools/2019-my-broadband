Jobs website Adzuna has released a report which outlines how much of their salaries South Africans use for rent. Adzuna analysed rental data and the latest job listings to uncover which tenants are are the biggest winners and losers in South Africa. Adzuna’s data shows that Gauteng is the most affordable province for tech employees to rent in on average, in terms of rental costs as a percentage of a tech employee’s salary. This is primarily due to Gauteng offering the highest IT salaries in the country. Other affordable provinces for tech employees include Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape, where rental costs constitute an average of 22% of employees’ total salaries. KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape, and the Northern Cape all require an average of at least 30% of tech employees’ salaries to cover rent. The Western Cape tops the list, requiring IT professionals to contribute 32% of their salary towards rent. This is due to Western Cape rentals costing significantly more than those in any other province. Looking at the situation on a city level, the most affordable South African city for any employee – not only the tech sector – to rent in is Polokwane, in which the average working resident spends 11% of their salary on rent. Other affordable cities include Bloemfontein (16%), Port Elizabeth (17%), Johannesburg (18%), and East London (19%). “It is interesting to note that Johannesburg comes up as one of the most affordable cities for renting employees,” said Adzuna SA country manager Jesse Green. “The results we see here could be because employment in Johannesburg offers much higher salaries when compared with job opportunities in cities such as Bloemfontein, for example.” The most expensive cities in SA to rent include Cape Town (38%), Vanderbijlpark (38%), Sandton (37%), and Richards Bay (26%). The average percentage of IT employees’ salaries spent on rent, listed by province, is shown below.
