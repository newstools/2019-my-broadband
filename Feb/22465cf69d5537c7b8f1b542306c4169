Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy Fold – a smartphone which folds out into a tablet. The Fold was unveiled at Samsung’s 2019 Unpacked event and, like its name suggests, is a smartphone that can fold to change shape. The device in its smartphone format features a 4.6-inch display – but users are able to open it up and unfold it into a 7.3-inch tablet. This is thanks to an internal smart hinge developed by Samsung, which the company said is super durable, and an “infinity flex display”. With the large display in action, Samsung added that three-app multitasking will be accessible by users. For example, watching a YouTube video, messaging in WhatsApp, and searching in Google. Using an app and switching between smartphone and tablet mode will also be seamless, and the app will continue on the new screen it is shifted to. Samsung said the device will be available in four colours, with different colour hinges available too. The Fold packs a 7nm processor, 12GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and two batteries which total 4,380mAh of power. Other features include a six-camera system – three lenses on the back, two on the inside, and one on the front. A side-button fingerprint sensor will also be included. Samsung said the Fold will be available in LTE and 5G versions, and will start at $1,980 when it goes on sale on 26 April.
