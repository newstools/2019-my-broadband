Eskom announced that it is unlikely to implement load-shedding on Friday, due to improvement in generation performance. The power utility said it has made progress in replenishing its water and diesel reserves, although the power system remains vulnerable. Eskom added that there is a chance load-shedding could be implemented at short notice if there is a change in plant performance. Recent heavy rains could also impact the feeding of coal to boilers, with a potential impact on generation production. “We thank South Africans and all our customers for working with us through a very difficult five days,” Eskom stated.
