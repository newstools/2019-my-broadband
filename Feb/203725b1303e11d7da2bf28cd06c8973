GoDaddy, the world’s biggest cloud platform dedicated to small, independent ventures, is launching in South Africa on 13 March 2019. GoDaddy is an American company which is well-known for offering domain registrations and web hosting. The company has 18 million customers across the globe with 77 million domain names currently under management. “GoDaddy is the place people come to name their idea, build a professional website, attract customers and manage their work,” the company said. GoDaddy promises South African entrepreneurs the tools to get online and “help small businesses make it big online”. The company has previously offered its services across many countries including South Africa, but it said it would now offer specific packages priced in South African rand. GoDaddy’s website offers local pricing for its various products, which include .co.za domain names from R89.00 per year and .com domains from R14.99 per year. The company added that it would now also have a physical presence in South Africa via an agency. In South Africa, GoDaddy will compete against established hosting companies like Hetzner and Afrihost.
