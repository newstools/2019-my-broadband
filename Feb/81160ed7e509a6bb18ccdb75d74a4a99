LG has unveiled the V50 ThinQ smartphone – its first 5G offering – at MWC 2019 in Barcelona. The phone will offer users two screens, as it looks to compete with foldable smartphones like the Huawei Mate X and Samsung Galaxy Fold. The main screen is a 6.4-inch QHD+ OLED display, while the second screen is 6.2-inch OLED display – the difference in size owing to a larger bezel on the latter. The V50 ThinQ offers a triple-lens rear camera as well as HDR imaging, which allows the V50 to take 4K 60fps video. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor and X50 5G modem – both of which are the standard for flagship 5G smartphones released to date. This is powered by a 4,000mAh battery – 20% larger than the LG V40 ThinQ. LG will initially release the V50 ThinQ in the US, South Korea, Australia, and various European countries. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297342" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Back.png" alt="LG-V50-ThinQ Back" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Back.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Back-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Back-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297344" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Front.png" alt="LG-V50-ThinQ Front" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Front.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Front-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Front-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-297346" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Dual-Screen-Gaming-639x430.png" alt="LG-V50-ThinQ-Dual-Screen Gaming" width="639" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Dual-Screen-Gaming-639x430.png 639w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Dual-Screen-Gaming-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Dual-Screen-Gaming-594x400.png 594w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-Dual-Screen-Gaming.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297348" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-with-Dual-Screen-1.png" alt="LG-V50-ThinQ-with-Dual-Screen 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-with-Dual-Screen-1.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-with-Dual-Screen-1-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LG-V50-ThinQ-with-Dual-Screen-1-595x400.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
