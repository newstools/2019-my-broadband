Windows 7 support is set to end in January 2020, after which updates will no longer be delivered to users. Windows 7 users will need to upgrade to Windows 10 by 14 January 2020 to avoid losing support for their operating system. However, if you are using Windows 7 and do not want to upgrade but still want to receive Windows updates following this deadline, you will have to pay. ZDNet has obtained the pricing for Microsoft’s paid Windows 7 Extended Security Updates, which are charged on a per-device basis. Windows 7 Pro users will be charged $50 for the first year of updates – increasing each year. The prices, per device, for Windows 7 Extended Security Updates are listed below. Microsoft has not officially published this pricing, and the costs may be negotiable depending on volume.
