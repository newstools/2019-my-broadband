That way, when game-time arrives, all you have to do is press “Play”. If you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, stream SuperSport with DStv Now data bundles from Telkom, Vodacom or MTN. Remember: go into Quality Settings in the app and choose a lower setting so you use less data when you stream. Buy your DStv Now data bundles via USSD Telkom (*180!1*5*1*3*1#), MTN (*136*2*999#) and Vodacom (*135#). This article was published in partnership with DStv Now.
