Despite the various improvements made to the update process in Windows 10, many Home users still find it too complex, according to researchers by University College London. The research surveyed 93 Windows 10 Home Edition users and found that many are still plagued by unexpected restarts and confusing update setting configurations. 53% of respondents stated that updating Windows was easier in Windows 10, but 97% of users said that the default 08:00-17:00 Active Hours for Windows update scheduling werenâ€™t correct in their case. This time bracket is more applicable to office users, but respondents in the survey said that they usually used their PCs in the evening, and 28% of users did not even know that Active Hours existed. According to the research, a large proportion of Windows 10 Home users still do not understand the Windows update process, suggesting Microsoft still has progress to make in improving its user experience.
