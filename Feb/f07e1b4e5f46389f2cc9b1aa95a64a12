Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun has posted pictures of the upcoming Mi 9 Explorer Edition smartphone on Weibo, showcasing the device’s transparent rear panel. The smartphone sports a transparent back glass panel which displays a layout of components with various logos pasted on the design. Instead of displaying the smartphone’s PCB, Jun explained how the manufacturer inserted a carved 0.3mm-thick aluminium sheet between the PCB and the rear glass panel of the device. This sheet was milled by a micro CNC machine to resemble a circuit board, with a number of labels printed on the “components”. Labels printed on the carved component sheet include  “Mi 9”, “Super Mi”, and “Battle Angel” – and point to the smartphone having a 48MP rear camera with a seven-piece lens and an impressive 12GB of RAM.
