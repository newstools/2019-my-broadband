Samsung recently launched its latest range of Galaxy devices, which includes the Galaxy S10e, S10, and S10+, and Technomobi is taking pre-orders. The range redefines the Galaxy S style with its expansive Infinity-O display, creating an edge-to-edge experience for a unified design with no notchor bezel, as well as less visual distraction.
