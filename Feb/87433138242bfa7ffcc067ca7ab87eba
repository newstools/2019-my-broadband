Samsung has stated that it will no longer make new 4K Blu-ray or 1080p players, reported CNET. “Samsung will no longer introduce new Blu-ray or 4K Blu-ray player models in the US market,” said Samsung. This follows the company launching its most recent 4K players in 2017. “A high-end 4K player for 2019 along the lines of its UBD-M9500 was in the works, but has now been scrapped,” stated the report. While no reason was given for the move, the advent of 4K streaming from popular services like Netflix has made DVD and Blu-ray players redundant for many people.
