Fibre is continuing to overtake ADSL in South Africa, and the data demands of customers are subsequently increasing. While capped fibre packages may be suited to households who consume a modest amount of online media, tech-oriented users and gamers who spend a lot of time online and perform bandwidth-intensive tasks such as video games downloads and watching Netflix in 4K need an uncapped line. To see what is on offer when it comes to uncapped fibre in SA, we compared uncapped packages across several major ISPs for four fibre network operators – allowing us to showcase some of the best uncapped fibre packages available. It is important to note that the terms and conditions for each ISP package is different, and can be found on their respective websites. The fair usage policy (FUP), throttling, and shaping rules for each package also differ depending on price and ISP, and buyers should investigate these policies before deciding between uncapped fibre packages. To keep our comparison simple, we compared the cheapest uncapped packages available from local ISPs to determine the best-priced deals at each speed tier. As a result, packages like Vox’s basic uncapped 10Mbps Vumatel deal might be priced cheaper than Cool Ideas’ product, but the latter does not throttle usage or enforce fair usage policies. Packages exclusive to one provider, such as Cybersmart’s R899 500Mbps fibre deal, are excluded from this comparison.
