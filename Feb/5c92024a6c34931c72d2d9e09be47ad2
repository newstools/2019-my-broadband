NASA has announced that its Opportunity rover mission on Mars has come to an end. Opportunity stopped communicating with Earth following a Mars-wide dust storm which engulfed the autonomous rover in June 2018. NASA said it has made more than 1,000 attempts to restore contact and revive the rover, but it has been unsuccessful. “We have made every reasonable engineering effort to try to recover Opportunity and have determined that the likelihood of receiving a signal is far too low to continue recovery efforts,” said Mars Exploration Rover manager John Callas. Opportunity was only designed to last 90 days on the Martian surface, and exceeded all expectations by continuing to function for a total of 15 years – travelling 45km over its lifetime. The rover’s final transmission was received on 10 June 2018, after it entered its final resting spot on Mars in an area named Perseverance Valley.
