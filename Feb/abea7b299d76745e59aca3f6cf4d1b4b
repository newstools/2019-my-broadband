Google is expanding its right-click mail management menu to enable more quick access options for both Windows and Mac users. The new functionality will let users quick reply or forward an email by right clicking on it and selecting the appropriate option. Users will also be able to search for emails similar to the selected mail – such as other mails from the email’s sender, or emails with the same subject line. Additionally, the feature will allow users to open the selected email in a new window straight from the right-click menu. Google said the updated menu has begun rolling out to users who are signed up to G Suite’s “rapid release” track, and will be rolled out to all users from 22 February. The new right-click menu can be seen below.
