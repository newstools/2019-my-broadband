Leaked images from WinFuture show that the next set of Galaxy Buds will be able to charge wirelessly on the back of Samsung’s Galaxy S1o. The earbuds will need to be placed into a wireless charging case, which then charges the earbuds using a reverse-charging feature reportedly offered by the S10. Not much more is known about Samsung’s upcoming earbuds, but lots of information has been leaked about the Galaxy S10. Leaks suggest the S10 comes with an Infinity O display as well as a headphone jack. Samsung’s top-of-the-range S10+ will reportedly offer 5G as well as 1TB storage – although it could also cost more than Apple’s most expensive iPhone Xs Max. The official Samsung Galaxy S10 launch will take place on 20 February, and the range is expected to begin shipping on 8 March.
