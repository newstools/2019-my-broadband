Samsung recently launched a new SSD aimed at consumers, the 970 EVO Plus NVMe M.2. As the name suggests, the SSD uses a PCIe Gen 3.0 x4, NVMe 1.3 interface, which provides fast speeds for users. Samsung said the SSD can achieve the following: The high speeds are thanks to Samsung’s latest V-NAND technology – which provides improved NAND performance and higher power efficiency – and optimised firmware. Samsung added that the drive also sports 512MB of low-power DDR4 SD RAM as cache memory and AES 256-bit encryption to keep data secure.  Another standout feature of the SSD is that it will come in capacities up to 2TB. 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB options are currently available, with the 2TB version set to release in April 2019, said Samsung. These drives will provide 1.5 million hours of reliability (MTBF), and only draw an average of 5.8W – with a maximum power draw of 9W. Samsung said this may vary depending on the system the SSD is used in. As stated earlier, it conforms to the M.2 (2280) form factor, and will slot in your motherboard accordingly. Onto the important part – the pricing. The 970 EVO Plus has just arrived at South African retailers, and starts at R1,700. Current local pricing for the SSD is as follows: While this is substantially more than a 2.5-inch SATA SSD – a 500GB Samsung 860 EVO 2.5-inch drive, for example, sells for R1,800 – the performance benefits are clear. Samsung’s 500GB Samsung 860 EVO (SATA III) provides sequential read and write speeds of 550MB/s and 520MB/s respectively. This makes the M.2 NVMe drive over six-times faster. The form factor of the drive must also be considered, as slotting in an M.2 drive is much easier, in terms of space management and its lack of cabling, compared to installing an SSD. If you have the extra budget and want super-fast speeds for your operating system and key applications (including your favourite games), then the new 970 EVO Plus is a no-brainer.
