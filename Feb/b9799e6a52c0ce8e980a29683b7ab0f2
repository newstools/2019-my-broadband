Mastercard has launched its “sonic brand identity”, a sound architecture that represents the brand. The Mastercard melody, which you can listen to here, comes after the company unveiled new branding – pictured in the logo image above. “Sound adds a powerful new dimension to our brand identity and a critical component to how people recognise Mastercard today and in the future,” said Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer at Mastercard. Mastercard said musicians, artists, and agencies from across the globe – including Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park – were used to create the melody. The Mastercard melody will extend to many assets, including musical scores, sound logos, ringtones, hold music, and point-of-sale acceptance sounds, said the company.
