FNB has launched its new Easy Smart Option bank account for lower-income consumers. The account offers combined legal, medical, and financial advice to customers who earn between R1,000 and R7,000 per month. FNB Easy Smart Option includes 24-hour telephonic professional medical advice from a team of registered nurses who will assist users to manage their medical conditions. This account also offers consumers assistance from qualified financial advisors and legal assistance from professional attorneys and paralegal. Customers will also receive R3,000 of both deposits and withdrawals at FNB ATMs, R15 airtime every month, free card swipes, a free savings account, 10 free online purchase transactions and free balance enquiries on FNB’s electronic channels. “Traditional bank accounts do not always service the range of needs of consumers who earn below and slightly above South Africa’s minimum wage,” said FNB consumer chief executive Dr Christoph Nieuwoudt. “We believe that the combination of a suitable bank account, free and helpful value-added benefits will go a long way to helping consumers with money management,” Nieuwoudt said. The monthly account fee for the FNB Easy Smart Option account is R65, and customers can access medical, legal, and financial advice can be accessed by dialing 0800 611 269.
