Samsung recently launched its new line-up of Galaxy smartphones at its Unpacked 2019 event. We were lucky enough to attend the event and get our hands on the new Galaxy S10+. Inside the Galaxy S10+ box, there are a bunch of useful accessories in addition to the smartphone, including a fast charger, USB Type-C fast charging cable, and USB to USB-C adapter. A pair of high-quality AKG earphones with braided cables are also bundled with the device, making the most of the Samsung GalaxyS10+’s retention of the audio jack. A rigid plastic cover, in case you are worried about dropping the premium smartphone, is the final additional to the package. The Galaxy S10+ we received has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, and comes in an attractive Prism White finish. Samsung’s Infinity-O display offers a large 6.4-inch panel with even smaller bezels than before, and the curved sides of the device make it easy to hold and use in a single hand. The in-screen fingerprint sensor also frees up space on the rear of the smartphone, where the powerful triple-lens camera is positioned. Samsung’s Galaxy S10+ is a great device with its attractive Infinity-O display and powerful camera system, and we couldn’t wait to start using it. Watch our unboxing video of the Galaxy S10+ below.
