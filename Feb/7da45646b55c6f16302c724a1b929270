After a video published in September 2018 by The Verge titled “How to build a custom PC for gaming, editing, or coding” went viral for the wrong reasons, YouTubers who mocked the video were issued takedown requests and copyright strikes. However, The Verge’s managing editor TC Sottek said that it was not The Verge who issued the strikes. “The Verge’s editorial structure was involved zero percent in the decision to issue a strike,” Sottek told ArsTechnica. “Vox Media’s legal team did this independently and informed us of it after the fact.” According to The Verge editor Nilay Pilay, when he learned of the decision by Vox Media, he successfully asked for the strikes to be removed – despite maintaining that the lawyers were justified in issuing the strikes on legal grounds. The PC build video was criticised for having technical errors, such as when host Stefan Etienne installed his power supply backwards, putting too much thermal paste on his CPU, and not attaching his anti-static bracelet to anything. Case law in the area of reaction videos is lacking, with most copyright infringement complaints instead remaining within YouTube’s resolution platform. The original video by The Verge was re-posted online after it was taken down by the publication, and is below.
