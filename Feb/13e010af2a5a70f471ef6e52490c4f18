Logitech has re-launched the “best mouse ever”, the Logitech G MX518. “Over the years, our community has consistently asked us to bring back the legendary Logitech G MX518, which many consider to be the finest gaming mouse of all time,” said Logitech. The “reborn” MX518 has the same shape and feel of the original mouse, but now includes a HERO 16K sensor and a 32-bit ARM processor for a 1ms report rate. “The MX518 also features eight programmable buttons so you can bind custom commands.” The MX518 will sell for $60 in the US, and is available for pre-order.
