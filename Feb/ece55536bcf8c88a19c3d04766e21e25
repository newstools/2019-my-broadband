Smartphones have become the photography devices of choice for millions of people around the world. DSLR and other dedicated cameras are primarily designed for hobbyists and professionals – but for the everyday person wanting to take snaps of their holiday or a family event, smartphone cameras don’t just pass the test, they dominate it. When buying a smartphone, the quality of the installed camera is now one of the most important factors to take into account. However, it can be difficult to sift through the marketing talk to get down to the nitty-gritty of smartphone camera performance. Independent camera benchmarking organisation DxOMark looks to solve this problem by using scientific methods to rate each smartphone’s camera system – providing an objective score at the end of its process. For its smartphone camera reviews, DxOMark analyses the performance of cameras across various components and technologies, such as lenses, sensors, camera controls, and image processing. Scores are then based upon the following criteria: You can learn more about how DxOMark tests smartphone camera systems in the video below.  According to DxOMark, there is no splitting Huawei and Samsung’s flagship smartphones as far as primary camera systems are concerned. The Samsung Galaxy S10+, Huawei Mate 20 Pro, and Huawei P20 Pro all score 109 for their main camera systems. However, according to the benchmarks, the S10+’s selfie camera system blows other smartphones out of the water – scoring 96 compared to the Mate 20 Pro and P20 Pro’s scores of 75 and 72 respectively. The closest competitor to the S10+’s selfie camera’s is the Google Pixel 3, as well as Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 – both of which score 92. DxOMark’s full rankings for primary and selfie cameras, as of February 2019, are below.
