Two employees at Huawei Technologies Inc. in Denmark were expelled following an inspection focusing on improper work arrangements. The company’s offices in Copenhagen were searched on Thursday and four people were initially charged with breaking Danish laws covering residence and work permits, Danish police said. The charges against two of the people were subsequently dropped, a police spokesperson said by phone on Monday. It was a “routine investigation” that Danish authorities “regularly” conduct at work places relying on a high number of foreign employees, the spokesperson said. The person, who asked not to be identified by name citing police policy, declined to provide more details, including the nationality of the workers. The investigation comes as the company is under fire around the world over allegations it could enable spying by Chinese officials after the country passed a law mandating organizations and citizens to assist national intelligence in their investigations. The U.S. has urged European allies, such as Germany, to shun Huawei’s equipment, as telecoms carriers prepare for the next generation of wireless technology known as 5G. There is no evidence that the measures taken in Denmark are related to any concerns about spying. Poland in January detained a Huawei employee and former high-ranking official at Poland’s Internal Security Agency, accusing the two men of conducting espionage activities against Poland. Huawei has said it fired the employee for breaking Polish law, adding that his alleged actions have not relation to the company.
