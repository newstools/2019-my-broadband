Huge Group has released a SENS report announcing that subsidiary Huge Cellular has won its court case against Cell C, disallowing the latter from terminating services it is currently providing to Huge Cellular. “The litigation took the form of an urgent application to interdict Cell C from… terminating the subsidiary companies’ access to the Cell C mobile telephone network,” said Huge Group. Cell C and Huge Cellular were involved in an Enterprise Supply Agreement, which was not extended by the parties, meaning that it was going to be suspended. As part of this agreement Cell C provided Huge Cellular with wholesale airtime, which Huge Cellular used to deliver enterprise telecommunications services to its customers. Termination of the agreement would have seen 16,000 Huge Cellular customers without connectivity. As part of its case, Huge Cellular argued that Cell C should honour a clause in the agreement which allows Huge Cellular to continue using an accumulated number of minutes following the termination of the contract, up until February 2022. When asked to provide comment on the ruling, Cell C said “the judge ordered that the parties take the matter to arbitration, which we will do.”
