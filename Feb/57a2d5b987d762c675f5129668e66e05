MyBroadband has improved its speed test platform by adding a new speed test server at NAPAfrica Durban, which complements its Joburg and Cape Town servers. The latest improvement means that MyBroadband now has speed test servers at all NAPAfrica Internet Exchange points in South Africa. These speed test servers are connected via 10Gbps links to NAPAfrica to ensure there is ample capacity for accurate speeds of even the fastest broadband connections. The new Durban speed test server will increase the accuracy of speed tests in KwaZulu-Natal for both web-based tests and mobile app speed tests. To encourage users to test their speed and rate their ISP, MyBroadband is giving away prizes worth R5,000. Here is what you must do to stand a chance to win: The giveaway will run until 4 March 2019, and the winners will be announced shortly afterwards.
