Eskom announced that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding on Monday 11 February. The rotational power outages will take place from 09:00 until 22:00, with the objective of shedding 2,000MW of power nationwide. Eskom said that while many generating units have been returned to service, other units continue to trip, resulting in a shortage of generating capacity. The power utility advised residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period in an effort to reduce demand. This is the second day in a row Eskom has implemented stage 2 load-shedding. The tweet below details the load-shedding announcement.
