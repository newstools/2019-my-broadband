Engadget reports that Google’s latest Gmail app update is now available to Android users. The update focuses on modernising the look and feel of the app. Included in this makeover is the removal of the old red title bar, which has been replaced by a long search bar. It also uses Google’s newest fonts, and provides a “brighter and more spacious” viewing experience. Users can choose between the traditional skin, as well as “comfortable” and “compact” alternatives to make the viewing process simpler. The update also includes basic new features, such as attachment previews and phishing warnings. Google said that the new iOS version should be available to Apple users by the end of this week.
