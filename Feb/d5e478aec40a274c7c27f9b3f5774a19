Samsung has unveiled its new QLED TVs for 2019, which include a number of new features. In a press release which has since been removed from the Samsung website, the company outlined the improvements it has made to its QLED line-up. These include support for AMD’s FreeSync technology through Samsung’s Real Game Enhancer feature, as well as a dedicated iTunes app. An Auto Game Mode will also automatically detect game input and switch the TV to a low-latency configuration to improve gameplay. All the new QLED TVs include Samsung’s Quantum Processor 4K, which provides upscaling capabilities as well as various smart features. Sizes range from 43-inch to 98-inch models, and both 4K and 8K QLED displays with HDR support will be available. Samsung’s new range of QLED TVs are listed for pre-order on the company’s website, and are priced from $1,199.
