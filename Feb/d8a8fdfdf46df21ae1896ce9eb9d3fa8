Fibre network provider Frogfoot has announced that it will roll out fibre infrastructure in George. Upon completion, 5,486 George homes will gain access to Frogfoot’s fibre network. “The area has been broken down into sectors, with each having its own start date for the infrastructure rollout,” said Frogfoot’s head of sales Shane Chorley. “We are anticipating that the first three sectors will be completed by May, and the greater George phase 1 by November 2019.” The first three sectors that will receive access to fibre are Champhers Drift, and Bodorp Zone sectors 1.1 – 1.3 Chorley said that Frogfoot’s rollout will make it one of the first infrastructure providers to provide the George area with access to fibre. “This will open doors in the area to use fibre for new services, including improved access to CCTV security and online entertainment,” said Chorley.
