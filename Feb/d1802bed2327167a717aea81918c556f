CNBC reports that Apple will release its upcoming video streaming service in April or early May. The new service will offer free, unique content for Apple device owners – while also allowing users to use existing streaming products in the iOS TV app. CBS, Viacom, and Showtime are expected to offer their services on Apple’s platform, but the service will not include Netflix. HBO’s presence on Apple’s platform is uncertain at this point, with discussions reportedly not as advanced as those with the likes of CBS – due in part to Apple not offering HBO the same terms that Amazon has offered the company. Apple’s service is likely to be a big competitor to Amazon Prime Video, which also offers original content and subscriptions to other services. According to CNBC, Apple wants to be paid 30% of every subscription that takes place through its service – double the amount that it currently takes from streaming apps that get sign-ups through the App Store.
