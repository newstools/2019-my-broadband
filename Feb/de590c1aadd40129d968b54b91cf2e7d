Intel recently released new updates for its Linux graphics driver to prepare the system for its upcoming discrete graphics cards, Phoronix reported. The updates reportedly introduce memory region support to Linux graphics driver, which is required for discrete graphics cards that have dedicated VRAM. This feature was previously not necessary for Intel’s graphics drivers, as the company’s integrated graphics share memory with the CPU. At the end of 2018, Intel confirmed it was working on discrete graphics cards and it was set to launch its GPU products in 2020. The company said it plans to launch GPUs for both server and consumer applications, adding that it would consider feedback from the community as it develops its graphics products.
