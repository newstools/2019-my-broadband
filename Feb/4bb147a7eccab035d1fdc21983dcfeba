Motorola confirmed that it is working an a new foldable smartphone, the company told Engadget in an interview. The company’s vice president of global product Dan Dery said that Motorola has been working on foldable devices for a while now. Dery confirmed that the company’s foldable smartphone will launch this year, although there is no confirmed release date for the device yet. He said the company had no intention of being later to market than competitors like Samsung and Huawei.
