Huawei has showcased its new 5G CPE devices at MWC 2019. Powered by the Huawei 5G Balong 5000 chipset, the devices offer a theoretical maximum speed of 4.6Gbps, whereas their expected top speeds on a live network clock up to 3.2Gbps. This means that a 1GB video clip can be downloaded in as little as three seconds, said Huawei. Additionally, these devices use the latest Wi-Fi standard – Wi-Fi 6 – which allows for peak download speeds from the CPE of 4.8Gbps. This is particularly effective for powering Huawei’s HiLink smart devices, as Wi-Fi 6 allows for multi-device access at up to four-times the speed of Wi-Fi 5. Huawei’s 5G CPE devices cover a wide variety of scenarios: Huawei’s new 5G CPE devices are shown below.
