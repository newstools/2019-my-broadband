Eskom has started stage 2 load-shedding on Thursday, due to strain on the grid. The company will implement load shedding from 08:00 until 22:00. This follows several days on consecutive load-shedding from the utility. Eskom added that diesel and water reserves have improved, and this has resulted in only stage 2 load-shedding being put in place today. It added that none of its operations were affected by Cosatuâ€™s industrial action which took place on Wednesday. Citizens are advised to restrict their use of electricity.
