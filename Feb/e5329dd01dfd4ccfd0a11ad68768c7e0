The This Person Does Not Exist website is making Internet users distrust whether photographs of people they see online are real. Every time users refresh this website, they are shown a new, seemingly real image of a person. However, all of these images are in fact not of real people, and are being created by artificial intelligence. Created by Uber software engineer Phillip Wang, the website uses an algorithm called a generative adversarial network (GAN). This particular GAN, StyleGAN, was created by a team of Nvidia researchers and is available on GitHub. This technology uses a database of real faces to formulate new, realistic images of non-existent people. Wang created the website to show the power of GANs and said that the technology is not limited to human faces. “Their research group have also included pretrained models for cats, cars, and bedrooms in their repository that you can immediately use,” said Wang. Wang hopes the website will bring attention to this powerful technology.
