Eskom has stated that it will start stage 3 load-shedding on Wednesday from 08:00 to 23:00. The company said the load-shedding is a result of a number of generating units going down thanks to breakdowns. Eskom added that water and diesel emergency reserves are still very low and they “remain concerned” about the risk this poses. Residents are once again asked to use electricity sparingly. Eskom said it will provide updates on the matter when new information comes to light.
