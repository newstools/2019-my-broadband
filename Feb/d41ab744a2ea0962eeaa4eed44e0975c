The January 2019 MyBroadband ISP report reveals that Supersonic is the top-rated fibre ISP in South Africa, followed by Cybersmart and Cool Ideas. The report is based on 213,776 broadband speed tests which were conducted on the MyBroadband speed test platform and Speedtest.co.za between 1 January and 31 January 2019. MyBroadband’s HTML5 speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to the MyBroadband speed test platform. As part of their speed test, users are also given the opportunity to rate their Internet service provider (ISP). These ratings are then used to rank South African ISPs based on their subscribers’ overall satisfaction. The table below ranks South Africa’s top fibre ISPs based on ratings from their subscribers. The table below shows the price of uncapped fibre-to-the-home products from South Africa’s top fibre ISPs. This pricing comparison was done on Openserve’s fibre infrastructure. The table below shows the average download speed, upload speed, and latency of the top fibre ISPs. It should be noted that these speeds are not only for fibre connections and can be influenced by the profile of fibre connectivity. It should therefore not be seen as an absolute measure of network performance, but rather as interesting additional information.
