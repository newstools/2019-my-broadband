The SD Association has launched microSD Express, a powerful mobile storage format that will offer users speeds of up to 985MB/s. The technology, which is defined in the SD 7.1 specification and is an extension of SD Express, will also use less power, according to the SD Association. The microSD Express technology uses the same PCIe 3.1 and NVMe v1.3 specifications that are currently used in computers to power SSDs. “MicroSD Express gives the mobile industry a compelling new choice to equip mobile devices with removable SSDs,” said Hiroyuki Sakamoto, the president of the SD Association. “SD 7.1 prepares consumers and mobile device manufacturers to meet ever-increasing storage demands for years to come.” This new technology will be backwards compatible with previous microSD technology.
