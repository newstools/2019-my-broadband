Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni has delivered his 2019 Budget Speech, in which he has detailed tax hikes for South Africa. “Fiscal prudence requires some tax changes. We propose additional revenue measures of R15 billion in 2019/20,” said Mboweni. “There will be a slight upward adjustment of the tax-free threshold for personal income taxes, with no change in the current personal income tax brackets.” The tax-free threshold increases from R78,150 to R79,000. This will raise R12.8 billion. Mboweni also detailed how excise duties on alcohol and tobacco, and other hikes, will be implemented in the country. This is detailed in the list below. Mboweni stated that white bread flour, cake flour, and sanitary pads will be zero-rated for VAT purposes from 1 April 2019.
