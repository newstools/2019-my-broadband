The latest P3 Communications research report confirms MyBroadband’s findings that MTN has the best network in South Africa. P3 Communications is a German company which provides technology consulting and testing services for mobile networks. For its latest mobile network quality assessment, the company performed drive tests in South Africa between 24 January and 11 February 2019, using Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphones. It performed 5,200 voice tests and 4,600 data tests per operator in cities (50%), towns (10%), and on roads (40%). The data tests measured HTTP download and upload speeds, web browsing, and YouTube video streaming. In addition to its drive tests, crowdsourced performance data was collected and evaluated between November 2018 and January 2019. The testing route and crowdsourced data maps are shown below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-297818 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Map-640x428.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Map-640x428.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Map-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Map-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Map.jpg 756w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-297820 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Crowdsourced-640x428.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Crowdsourced-640x428.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Crowdsourced-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Crowdsourced-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Crowdsourced.jpg 756w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The P3 Communications network testing showed that MTN reigned supreme in voice and data network quality. The table below shows the scores achieved by the networks for voice and data services, and the breakdown of points in the cities, towns, and roads categories. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-297816 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/P3-640x259.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="259" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/P3-640x259.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/P3-600x243.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/P3.jpg 691w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> P3 Communications’ findings mirror MyBroadband’s network performance rankings, which were released in January. MyBroadband’s network quality testing is similar to P3’s methodology, and includes controlled drive tests and crowd-sourced testing. MyBroadband, however, makes use of a wide range of high-end smartphones, including Huawei Mate 20 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S9, Samsung Galaxy S8, and Motorola Moto Z models. MyBroadband’s reporting further differs from P3 Communications in that only the data network is tested. MyBroadband’s Mobile Network Quality Report rankings for Q4 2018 are shown below.
