A recent MyBroadband poll revealed that ADSL is still a popular broadband connection type for South Africans. While most MyBroadband readers stated that they have fibre at home, ADSL came in second place in terms of primary home broadband connection – with fixed-LTE in third place. ADSL may not offer the high speeds or low latency of fibre, but it can be a capable connection, particularly for applications like downloading and media streaming. Additionally, many users do not have any choice but to use ADSL as there are no competing broadband technologies available where they live. For these users, we have compiled a list of the best uncapped ADSL deals from South Africa’s biggest ISPs. The table below details the pricing of 2Mbps, 4Mbps, and 10Mbps packages, and what type of account is on offer – Home or Premium. It must be noted that these are bundle deals, which include ADSL line rental. The deals do not include a Telkom landline, however, which is an additional R200.74 per month and must be purchased through Openserve. The only exception is the Telkom account, which includes the ADSL and landline rental in the bundle.
