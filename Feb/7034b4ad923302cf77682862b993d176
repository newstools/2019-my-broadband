Rain has partnered with Truphone for eSIM support on its mobile network in South Africa. The operator will use Truphone’s eSIM remote SIM provisioning platform to become the first carrier in the country to service devices with eSIM functionality. Truphone’s eSIM provisioning platform connects to customers using the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max, iPhone Xr, Google Pixel 3, or any other eSIM-enabled device. The company said its commercial model allows mobile operators to rapidly deploy eSIM support without any significant set-up cost and no upfront usage fees. “I am delighted to see Rain joining a rapidly-growing number of operators on our platform,” said Truphone CEO Ralph Steffens. Rain recently told MyBroadband that it was running a number of eSIM devices on its mobile network, which were working “exceptionally well”. The operator said its tests with the iPhone Xs Rain eSIM achieved download speeds of over 99Mbps and upload speeds over 11Mbps, with a ping of 59ms. Rain told MyBroadband that it would launch eSIM support around May this year, and in the meantime it is testing a robust RICA process to ensure that legislation is adhered to. The first devices with eSIM support from Rain will include the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max, iPhone Xr, and eSIM-enabled iPads.
