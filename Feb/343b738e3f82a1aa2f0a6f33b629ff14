Google’s automated iteration of Gmail – Google Inbox – is shutting down, but some of its features will reportedly be tested in Gmail. A screenshot by a Redditor suggests that Inbox features such as reminders, pins, and bundles will be tested in an updated version of Gmail. The bundles feature, which groups mails according to what they’re about, has already been announced by Google as part of upcoming versions of Gmail. Inbox was released in 2014, and was marketed as a more powerful version of Gmail. However, Google announced in 2018 it would shut down Google Inbox. “Inbox by Gmail has been a great place to experiment with new ideas,” said Google in the announcement.
