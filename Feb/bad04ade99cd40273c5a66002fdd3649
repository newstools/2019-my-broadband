Raspberry Pi 3 owners can now install a full version of Windows 10 on their device. The Windows on ARM (WoA) installer is available on GitHub, and can be used to install Microsoftâ€™s operating system on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or B+ boards. Previously, Windows IoT Core was the only Windows operating system available on Raspberry Pi devices. This new package offers functionality similar to the standard desktop version of Windows 10. The installer available on GitHub is designed for simplicity and ease of use, and requires bundled binaries and the WoA core package. To install Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi 3, users can download the Windows 10 ARM image, WoA installer, and core packages. They can then run the WoA installer and import the core package to deploy Windows 10.
