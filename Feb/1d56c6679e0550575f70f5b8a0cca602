Microsoft has begun testing a Windows 10 update, codenamed 20H1, that it only plans to roll out in 2020, reports The Verge. Microsoft usually releases updates twice a year and an update is already scheduled to take place in April – making Microsoft’s work on this 2020 update unusual. Little is known about what features Microsoft is testing. “Some things we are working on in 20H1 require a longer lead time,” explained Microsoft’s Windows Insider lead Dona Sarkar. The upcoming April 2019 update, however, is expected to include a new “light theme,” the separation of voice assistant Cortana from Windows’ search feature, and an integrated Microsoft Office app. The previous Windows update, released in October 2018, has been Microsoft’s least successful one to date.
