A leak by Evan Blass has revealed a pearl white version of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S10+ smartphone. The image also all but confirms that the Galaxy S10+ will come with a triple-lens camera – and it shows the flash positioned next to these lenses on a camera bump. Additionally, the lack of a fingerprint sensor on the back of the device points to the rumoured embedded sensor within the screen. The Samsung Galaxy S10 is expected to come with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet, an Infinity O display, a headphone jack, Wi-Fi 6, and a more powerful battery than the S9 range. The top-of-the-range S10+ will reportedly cost €1,499 – more than the iPhone Xs Max at €1,449. This version is rumoured to offer 1TB storage and 12GB RAM. The official Samsung Galaxy S10 launch is happening on 20 February, and the range is expected to start shipping on 8 March.
