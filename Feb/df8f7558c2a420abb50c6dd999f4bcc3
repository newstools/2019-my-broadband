MultiChoice Group listed on the JSE on 27 February 2019, with its share price starting at R95 when the market opened. When the markets closed at 17:00, the share price had moved to R106, which left many asking: Is MultiChoice Group – code MCG – a good investment? JSE representatives at the listing event said there was phenomenal interest in the new share, and MultiChoice Group CEO Calvo Mawela was understandably positive about the potential of the company. “We are Africa’s best entertainment platform,” said Mawela. “We have the opportunity to grow this business into the future.” Naspers announced in September 2018 that it would separate its video entertainment business and list it separately on the JSE. “The new company will be named MultiChoice Group and will include MultiChoice South Africa, MultiChoice Africa, Showmax Africa, and Irdeto,” said Naspers. “Listing MultiChoice Group via an unbundling aims to unlock value for Naspers shareholders,” it added. Speaking to MyBroadband, Mawela said that MultiChoice is a good long-term investment for buyers, thanks to its South African unit which is cash-generating and profitable, and its African operations which are showing good growth. “In the past two years, we have grown by 3 million subscribers. That is phenomenal in the pay-TV industry,” said Mawela. The success in Africa is, in part, attributed to MultiChoice employing local shareholders and employees in its business operations. For example, in Kenya, the business is run by Kenyans. This ensures that the decision makers understand the country they operate in and the required go-to-market strategies. Shareholders can also interact with local governments to meet any regulatory requirements. Mawela said that MultiChoice’s investment in over-the-top streaming services like Showmax will also hold it in good stead going forward. “With OTT being at an infancy stage, we have started as pioneers to start Showmax and DStv Now. We looked at the opportunities, we invested in them, and we will continue to invest in them,” he said. As broadband penetration increases in Africa, Showmax and DStv Now will grow, he added. The company’s content offering is another pillar of strength, and Mawela stated that what they provide customers is “unmatched” – particularly when it comes to sports channels. “This is a good opportunity for anyone who wants to invest in a company that is consumer-facing in the African market that has a good growth story,” said Mawela. In terms of more near-term rewards, the MultiChoice Group CEO said the paying of dividends has already been decided on will take place in 2020.
