Google is developing a new feature for Chrome called “Never Slow” mode, which aims to make the browser faster on certain websites. A new commit to the Chromium source code outlines the purpose of the feature, which is to limit the amount of resources loaded depending on the user’s connection. This browsing mode restricts resource loading and runtime processing to ensure that the browser never runs slowly. The experimental flag for the commit reads as follows: Enables an experimental browsing mode that restricts resource loading and runtime processing to deliver a consistently fast experience. WARNING: may silently break content! Once this feature is implemented in an experimental version of Chrome, certain data will not be loaded if it exceeds a size threshold, which will make page loading faster. There is currently no information on whether this feature will be implemented in a stable release of Chrome.
