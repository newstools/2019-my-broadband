FNB announced that customers who use FNB Connect will benefit from data rollover changes and the ability to transfer mobile data. The company said its MVNO would align with ICASA’s new regulations for mobile operators, which are set to come into effect on 28 February. These regulations also call for data depletion notifications and out-of-bundle data usage by default prevention. “We are providing an option for a free rollover of data near the expiry date for use in the following month,” said FNB Connect CEO Len Pienaar. “Customers who are on FNB Connect can also transfer data to one another, which is a major benefit for households.” FNB Connect customers will receive depletion notifications when their data usage is at 50%, 80%, and 100%, and will be requested to provide consent before being charged out-of-bundle data rates. “We believe that the combination of free data rollover, data transfer, depletion notices, and consent on out-of-bundle usage adds significant value to FNB customers.”
