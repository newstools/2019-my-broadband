OLX has released its list of the best-selling second-hand cars on its platform in 2018. “We looked at the fastest-selling, the most wanted, and most listed ads nationally and provincially and found some interesting insights,” said Nicole Depene-Sander, marketing manager at OLX. According to OLX’s data, the Ford Ranger was the fastest selling car in South Africa for 2018. Additionally, more Volkswagen Polo and Golf vehicles were sold on OLX than any other vehicle last year. Other used vehicles that were highly sought after in 2018 included the Toyota Corolla, BMW 3 Series, and Toyota Hilux. TransUnion has predicted that the used car market could see growth in 2019. “At a dealer level, there are indications that the market is swinging toward used vehicles, which tend to have a larger margin than new vehicle sales,” said TransUnion. TransUnion also said that financing institutions are financing over double the number of used vehicles as they are new ones. The best-selling second-hand vehicles on OLX are detailed in the graphics below.
