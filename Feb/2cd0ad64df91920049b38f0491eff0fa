MTN has filed an application in the South Gauteng High Court to force a former employee to pay back R53 million she stole. In 2017, it was reported that Ruth Moshabane – an accountant at MTN – defrauded the company of over R23 million. Moshabane appeared in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in 2017 after being arrested on 11 April that year. She faced 16 counts of fraud, which took place between 2011 and 2017, and included accusations of transferring money from MTN to her personal bank account. This was done using fictitious requisitions, and was eventually picked up by the financial intelligence centre board. A report by the Sunday World has stated that MTN will now pursue compensation from Moshabane for the crimes. This includes interest on the money taken, and MTN’s legal costs. The report added that the total stolen by Moshabane was much higher that the R23-million figure reported in 2017 – and sits at over R53 million, according to court papers. The papers further detailed how Moshabane started her fraudulent transactions with a single transfer of R60,000. This evolved over the years, and in 2017 she was transferring over R1 million per month to herself. “MTN’s legal representative Jarrad Knoetze of Webber Wentzel Attorneys said no settlement had been reached as the matter was still in an infancy stage,” stated the report. Moshabane did not reply to requests for comment, added the report.
