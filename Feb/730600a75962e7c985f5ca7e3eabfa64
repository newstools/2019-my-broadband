South Africans received a rude awakening to the state of Eskom and the national power grid when load-shedding kicked in this year. Daily power outages are a great inconvenience, especially if you forget to charge your smartphone before the power is switched off. Many smartphone batteries are not able to last through a load-shedding period under heavy use, but higher-end models boast impressive battery life – of which the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is a good option. It is a powerful device with a large battery and unique features, making it a good companion during power outages. The Mate 20 Pro boasts a 4,200mAh battery and fast-charging capabilities that allow Mate 20 Pro owners to charge their batteries to 70% in just 30 minutes. Even better, if your friends have smartphones which support wireless charging, you can charge their devices from your Mate 20 Pro’s battery by simply placing them on the back of your smartphone. The Mate 20 also offers a premium smartphone experience unmatched by other 2018 flagships. The device boasts the latest version of Android with an EMUI 9.0 interface, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and an impressive triple-lens camera system on the rear. Huawei also altered the design to implement a curved bezel-less screen with a notch at the top for the array of front-facing cameras that allow for improved facial biometric security.
