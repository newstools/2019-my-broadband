Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi has announced its first 5G smartphone at MWC in Barcelona, just days after Samsung announced its own 5G smartphone. The Mi Mix 3 5G is an update of the 4G version of the phone released last year, and features the same small sliding mechanism that housed the previous version’s selfie camera. After launching the original Mi Mix 3 as a 5G smartphone, Xiaomi was criticised when it was discovered that it only offered 4G functionality, and the full 5G version would only launch in the first quarter of 2019. The updated, 5G version of the phone includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor – an upgrade on the original Mi Mix 3’s Snapdragon 845 chip. It also includes the Qualcomm X50 5G modem, 256GB of storage, and a 6.39-inch display. Xiaomi said the Mi Mix 3 5G smartphone’s pricing will begin at €599, and should fully launch in May.
