The latest leaked information on Samsung’s Galaxy S10 shows that the device will be thinner than the previous model, the S9, while boasting a larger battery. A leak from IceUniverse suggests that Samsung has refined its design to reduce the S10’s thickness to 7.8mm – compared to the S9+ at 8.5mm. The information also suggests that the Galaxy S10+ will include a 4,100mAh battery, much bigger than the 3,500mAh battery inside the S9+. Samsung’s Galaxy S10 and S10+ smartphones are set to launch on 20 February, and leaked press renders show that they will sport Samsung’s Infinity O screen design with a front camera embedded into the display. The new smartphones are expected to start shipping from 8 March 2019, and will reportedly be priced higher than the iPhone Xs Max.
