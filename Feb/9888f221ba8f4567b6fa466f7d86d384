ICASA is investigating Vodacom’s proposed data bundle rollover charges to determine whether these charges are compliant with regulations. Vodacom is considering charging users up to R49 if they want to rollover their data bundles, following ICASA updating its end user rules for mobile networks. ICASA’s new regulations, which will force mobile networks to allow their customers to rollover unused data when their bundles expire, come into effect on 28 February. “ICASA is concerned that – on the face of it – these charges appear to be aimed at discouraging and/or making it unaffordable for consumers to enjoy the benefits conferred by the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Amendment Regulations, 2018,” said ICASA. The regulator added that it is engaging with Vodacom regarding its concerns, and will “upon consideration of all representations made by Vodacom make a determination as to whether there is a case of non-compliance.” Vodacom previously told MyBroadband it is currently reviewing its charges and “will communicate this on the planned launch date 1 March”. Its rollover charges made headlines this week when the operator published a pricing structure on its website, which it subsequently took down. Bundles with a validity of more than one day would incur the following rollover charges, dependent on the remaining data in the bundle (bundle size remaining): Vodacom stated that the charges for the rollover service are charged to a Prepaid and Hybrid’s customer recharge airtime account. The charge for a Contract customer will be added to their bill.
