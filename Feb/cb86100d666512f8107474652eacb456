NetFlorist MD Ryan Bacher has published a video on YouTube apologising for the company’s failure to deliver all orders on Valentine’s Day this week. Hundreds of NetFlorist customers took to Twitter, Facebook, and HelloPeter this week to complain about their orders not being delivered. HelloPeter was flooded with complaints, with scores of people stating that the orders they placed for Valentine’s Day had not arrived. Bacher told MyBroadband that the combination of heavy rain and load-shedding hit it hard on the day. “The combination of the rain and the multiple robots out was a perfect storm. We have never had this in previous years and it caught us by surprise. Our drivers couldn’t get to our pick-up point in time and then, when they did, couldn’t get the orders out in time,” said the company. “We don’t have final numbers yet, but our delivery success rate was in the low 90s as far as we can tell – this is a disaster for the people we let down.” In the video, posted below, Bacher stated that NetFlorist should have been prepared for these hurdles, and it is their fault the deliveries did not reach their destination. He stated that their drivers will be delivering this weekend and next week, and the company will do what is necessary to fix their mistake.
