MultiChoice recently announced its annual price adjustments for DStv, with several packages receiving fee increases. A notable omission from the list of price increases was DStv Premium – which received a “price freeze” for 2019. DStv Premium will remain R809 per month for the year ahead, marking the first time MultiChoice has not increased the price of the pay-TV package. “We understand that times are tough in South Africa, and that our customers are under pressure to make every cent they spend count,” said MultiChoice. As part of its price announcement to DStv customers, MultiChoice advertised its Price Lock package – offering price savings if you sign up for a Premium package over an extended term. DStv Premium Price Lock lets users sign up for R749 per month, as opposed to R809 per month, but they must sign a 24-month contract to take advantage of the discount. “This offer allows you to skip two years of price increase with a fixed monthly payment amount that will not change for 24 months,” states MultiChoice. “This offer includes your monthly subscription, as well as a complimentary Showmax subscription worth R99 per month.” To see whether DStv Price Lock is a good option for consumers, we compared it in three possible scenarios. The first is that DStv Premium is priced at R809 per month for 2019, and MultiChoice decides not to increase prices in 2020. The second is that DStv Premium is priced at R809 per month for 2019, but MultiChoice increases Premium prices by 3% in 2020. The third looks at a 6% increase in 2020. These scenarios, and their associated cost savings, are detailed in the table below.
