WhatsApp Business for iOS is now available in a beta version, WABetaInfo reports. WhatsApp Business is already available for Android devices, but it has taken longer for the app to become available on Apple devices. The iOS beta for WhatsApp Business can be downloaded through the TestFlight portal for devices running iOS 8 and up. WhatsApp Business allows companies to register an account on the platform and access new messaging tools such as quick replies, automated greeting, and away messages, and the ability to choose recipients. The platform also allows users to migrate existing WhatsApp accounts and contacts to a WhatsApp Business account. The app will reportedly be available for download in App Store in the near future.
