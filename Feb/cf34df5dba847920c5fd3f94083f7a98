Facebook CFO David Wehner announced that Facebook’s delayed Clear History tool will launch later this year, CNBC reports. Facebook first mentioned the feature at the beginning in May 2018 at its F8 conference, but at the time there was no confirmed release date for the feature. “Once we roll out this update, you’ll be able to see information about the apps and websites you’ve interacted with, and you’ll be able to clear this information from your account,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post. “You’ll even be able to turn off having this information stored with your account.” Zuckerberg warned that using the tool will impact users’ Facebook experiences – just like when you delete your cookies. “You may have to sign back in to every website, and you may have to reconfigure things.” “The same will be true here. Your Facebook won’t be as good while it relearns your preferences,” said Zuckerberg. When the feature was first announced in 2018, it was seen to be a reaction to Facebook’s data breach problems, such as the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal.
