Solid state drive technology is becoming increasingly advanced, allowing for cheaper and faster drives to be developed. This cost saving carries down to the consumer, with cheaper entry-level SSDs shipping to market each year along with faster high-end drives. The quality and capabilities of an SSD are measured by a number of specifications, including read/write speed, capacity, and mean time before failure (MTBF). MTBF is especially important for determining the endurance and projected lifetime of a solid state drive, and it is also important to note both the random and sequential read/write speeds. SSDs appear in multiple form factors, from 2.5-inch SATA drives to RAM-like M.2 modules. The interface the drive uses determines its maximum transfer speed, with SATA being the slowest and PCIe generally the fastest. Read more about SSD specifications here. Some drives, such as Intel’s Optane add-in-card SSDs, are used for specific purposes such as caching for high-demand enterprise environments, while others, such as the WD Blue SSD range, offer attractively-priced drives to everyday consumers. To help you decide which is the best for you, we have listed some of the best SSDs you can buy in 2019.
