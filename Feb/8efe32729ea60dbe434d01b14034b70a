Huawei has announced that it is preparing to launch its cloud data service in Africa next month. The company said it is working with South African partners to construct data centres in Johannesburg and, at a later date, Cape Town. By launching its Johannesburg data centre in March 2019, Huawei said it would be the world’s first cloud service provider with an operational data centre in Africa. Huawei Cloud has launched over 160 cloud services in 18 categories across the world, and plans to combine cloud and AI technology to launch innovative products in Africa. “If Cloud 1.0 is an era driven by infrastructure resources, then Cloud 2.0 is the era of cloud-native applications, driven by data and AI platforms,” said Huawei Cloud’s Farouk Osman Latib. “With cloud and AI, we aim to provide enterprises, small and large, with one-stop AI platform services, enriching fine-grained APIs, adapting rich algorithms in diverse industry sectors and heterogeneous computing infrastructure so that everyone can use various artificial intelligence algorithms to solve practical problems.” Huawei said it cloud services based at its local data centre would be ready for trial use from next week.
