FNB has seen unusually high volumes of unauthorised debit orders to Procall and Mzansi, said the bank. The bank detected that many of its customers were disputing Procall and Mzansi debit orders via the FNB app and online banking portal. FNB contacted a number of customers to validate the debit order mandates provided by Procall, and customers said they had not given authority for the debit order. “Our investigations have provided sufficient proof that the impacted customers had not provided a mandate for the debit order and as result, the debits to customer accounts were unauthorised,” said FNB Consumer chief executive Christoph Nieuwoudt. “FNB is proactively reversing all Procall debit orders including any associated charges and we are working with the corresponding bank to reverse all Mzansi debit orders.” The bank is also working with the Payments Association of South Africa (PASA) and the South African Banking Risk and Information Centre (SABRIC) on the issue, and said it will be pursuing criminal charges. “We apologise to impacted customers for the inconvenience caused and encourage them to regularly review their bank statements for any abnormalities,” said Nieuwoudt. FNB customers can stop, dispute, or reverse unauthorised debit orders of less than R200 for free on the FNB app, online banking, and cellphone banking. Debit orders that are higher than R200 can still be disputed and reversed via the FNB contact centre or at any FNB branch.
