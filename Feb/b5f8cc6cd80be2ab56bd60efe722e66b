Eskom has started stage 4 load-shedding, due to continued pressure on the grid. Eskom will implement stage 4 load-shedding from 13:00 until 22:00 this evening. “Since this morning we have unexpectedly lost six additional generating units which have put additional strain on the system,” said Eskom. Stage 4 load-shedding calls for 4,000MW to be load-shed from the national grid. Eskom asked users to use power sparingly during this time.
