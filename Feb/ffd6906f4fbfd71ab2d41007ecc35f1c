MultiChoice Group has released its investor roadshow presentation, in which it details what the company has to offer investors. The launch of the presentation follows MultiChoice Group releasing its pre-listing statement in compliance with the JSE’s listings requirements. The group includes the likes of MultiChoice South Africa, MultiChoice Africa, and Showmax, and is expected to begin trading on the JSE on 27 February 2019. As part of the presentation, MultiChoice detailed how it is the leading entertainment platform in Africa. It made the claim by comparing its subscriber numbers – which currently stand at 13.9 million across the continent – against those of StarTimes, Canal Plus Afrique, and Netflix. The data showed that MultiChoice is miles ahead of its competition, particularly against Netflix – which as shown in the graph below is only a fraction of its size in Africa. Netflix subscriber numbers are based on “digital TV research estimates”, said MultiChoice, as the company has not released official figures.  Netflix is a big threat to MultiChoice’s DStv, and the South African company has stated that the streaming service is cutting into its Premium subscriber base. While DStv subscriber numbers in Africa have grown in recent years, its Premium package has lost viewers. This has been attributed to high prices and competition from Netflix. MultiChoice has also revealed its subscriber mix in South Africa, in terms of how many customers are using Showmax and DStv Now. As seen in the graph below, “hybrid and streaming only” DStv Now and Showmax users make up 9% of MultiChoice South Africa’s subscriber mix. The remainder are pay-TV users. It must be noted that DStv Now is available for free to DStv pay-TV users, while Showmax is free for DStv Premium subscribers. The graph below further details the growth of Connected Video streams in the country, which have increased 15-fold since 2016. Connected Video includes DStv Now and Showmax streaming.
