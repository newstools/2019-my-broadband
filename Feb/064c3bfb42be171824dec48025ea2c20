Google may drop the dedicated back navigation button for its upcoming Android Q (10.0) operating system, XDA Developers reports. According to the report, an early build of the operating system shows improved gesture controls which drop the dedicated back button in favour of swiping left on the Home pill. Additionally, the experimental build also no longer allows users to disable the gesture interactions and revert to the legacy three-button navigation system. Gesture controls were first introduced as a system-wide control scheme for Android 9.0, although users have the option to choose the three-button interface if they prefer. The experimental build of the Android Q operating system also enhances the fluidity of app transitions. These features are currently unconfirmed, and Google may change its gesture options before the official release of Android Q.
