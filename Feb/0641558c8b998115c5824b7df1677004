Regulatory filings by Samsung, spotted by Droid Life, show that Samsung’s Galaxy S10 will support Wi-Fi 6 – making it the first smartphone to offer the Wi-Fi technology. Wi-Fi 6 offers significantly improved speeds when compared to previous Wi-Fi technologies, while using less battery power. The Galaxy S10 will also include an Infinity O display with both the front camera and fingerprint sensor embedded within it. The top-of-the-range Samsung Galaxy S10+ will reportedly cost €1,499 – more than the iPhone Xs Max, which costs €1,449 – and offer users 1TB storage and 12GB RAM. The official Samsung Galaxy S10 launch will take place on 20 February, and the S10 is expected to begin shipping on 8 March.
