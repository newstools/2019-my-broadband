Google might launch new Pixel 3 Lite and Pixel 3 XL Lite devices this year, according to filings made with the Federal Communications Commission. The filings point to the launch of budget or mid-range Pixel smartphone variants which could feature scaled-back specifications and lower price tags. A confidentiality request filed by Google will lift on 24 August, which suggest the company could launch the smartphones earlier than its usual Pixel event in October 2019. While the filings do not contain much information on the new devices apart from their connectivity specifications and support for Bluetooth and NFC, rumours have been circulating for months. Leaked information shows that the Pixel 3 Lite could feature a similar design to the flagship models, although they are expected to include a mid-range Snapdragon chips and scaled-back camera systems.
