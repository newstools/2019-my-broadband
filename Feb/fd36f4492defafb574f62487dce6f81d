Samsung has published a press release announcing it will begin replacing its current plastic product packaging with environmentally-friendly alternatives such as paper. By 2020, Samsung hopes to have transitioned completely to paper packaging – and to use 500,000 tons of recycled plastics by 2030. “Samsung Electronics is stepping up in addressing society’s environmental issues such as resource depletion and plastic wastes,” it said. “We are committed to recycling resources and minimising pollution coming from our products.” This move comes after Samsung previously came under criticism for sub-par levels of eco-friendliness, with Greenpeace awarding Samsung a D rating in its Guide to Greener Electronics in 2017. “Samsung has not kept pace with the efforts of Apple to reduce its greenhouse gas footprint and transition its factories to renewable sources of energy,” the report said at the time.
