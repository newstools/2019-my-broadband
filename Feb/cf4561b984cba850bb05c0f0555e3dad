A report by Softpedia News claims that Apple’s 2019 range of iPhones will cost the same as the 2018 range. This means the successors to the iPhone Xr, Xs, and Xs Max will begin at $749, $999, and $1,049 respectively. The most expensive 2019 iPhone would still cost $1,449 – potentially R31,999 in South Africa, depending on exchange rates. The report added that Apple clearly doesn’t believe high prices were the reason for the 2018 range’s poor sales figures, which saw sales decrease by 15%. However, the upcoming range will offer better technology than the 2018 versions, possibly including a triple-camera system with the flagship iPhone Xs Max replacement. This may convince buyers that the 2019 range of iPhones is better value for money – particularly given the reported price of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S10.
