Tesla’s Model 3 is no longer recommended by Consumer Reports due to problems with reliability. According to the report, Tesla 3 owners have identified a number of problems, including body hardware, paint, and trim issues. These problems also include in-car electronics glitches such as screen freezing or odd software behaviour, and glass defects in the rear window. While the vehicle scored highly in Consumer Reports’ owner satisfaction survey, the reports of reliability issues mean that the organisation can no longer recommend it. Responding to the change in recommendation, Tesla told Consumer Reports that the vast majority of these problems have already been corrected. “We take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements any time we hear about issues,” Tesla said.
