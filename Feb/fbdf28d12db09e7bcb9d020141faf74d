Corsair recently launched its latest pre-built PC, the Corsair One i160, which it describes as the ultimate gaming rig. The Corsair One i160 “redefines what you can expect from a high-performance gaming PC”, said Corsair. The i160 packs all the hardware you would expect from a prominent brand making such a claim about their product, including a liquid-cooled Intel Core i9-9900K and a liquid-cooled Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. This is combined with an “amazingly compact, quiet, and stunningly designed” chassis, added the company. Corsair’s LED-lined case measures only 12 litres in volume – essentially two Xbox One consoles stuck together – and the PC conforms to the Mini-ITX form factor. Other standout hardware elements include 32GB of DDR4-2666 RAM, a 480GB M.2 NVMe SSD, and Corsair SF600 80 Plus Gold power supply.  Following the launch of the Corsair One i160, the gaming PC has been reviewed by many international publications. Despite its small size, the PC performed well in benchmark and gaming tests – thanks to its liquid-cooled CPU and GPU. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, the latest flagship gaming graphics card from Nvidia, helped produce solid results when the Corsair One was tested by Tom’s Hardware. The gaming PC achieved the following results when tested by the publication: Corsair’s One i160 is currently available for $3,599 in the US.  <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
