YouTube will no longer allow anti-vaccination videos to run ads, reports BuzzFeed News. “We have strict policies that govern what videos we allow ads to appear on, and videos that promote anti-vaccination content are a violation of those policies,” YouTube said. “We enforce these policies vigorously, and if we find a video that violates them, we immediately take action and remove ads.” As part of this move, YouTube will place an information panel on a large number of anti-vaccination videos that links to Wikipedia’s vaccine hesitancy page, which describes anti-vaccination rhetoric as one of the top 10 biggest global health threats. YouTube’s move comes days after several big companies, such as Epic Games and Nestle, pulled ads from YouTube because they were running on videos where adults were making inappropriate comments about under-aged children.
