Steam has launched its Lunar New Year Sale, offering discounts on hundreds of games. The event celebrates the Year of the Pig by offering generous price cuts on many triple-A and indie titles on the platform. The sale will run from 4-11 February 2019, and buyers also receive R35 off their first purchase of R200 or more. Many games feature heavy discounts, and shoppers can earn tokens for buying titles during the sale. These tokens can be redeemed until 12 February for a variety of rewards, including golden profiles, badges, and additional discounts on your next purchase. Tokens will expire after 12 February, and buyers are advised to redeem any rewards before then. A screenshot of the Steam Lunar New Year highlighted deals is shown below. Game purchases in the office so far include GTA V for just over R200 and XCOM 2 (with all expansions) for under R300.
