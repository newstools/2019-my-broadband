The US Department of Transportation has announced a ban on lithium-ion batteries stored in baggage holds on commercial passenger flights. Lithium-ion batteries will also only be allowed to be shipped on cargo aircraft if they are at a 30% state of charge or less. “This rule will strengthen safety for the traveling public by addressing the unique challenges lithium batteries pose in transportation,” said US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao. The department said this rule will enhance passenger safety by allowing personal electronic devices to be carried as hand luggage aboard aircraft, while cargo shipments of batteries are transported separately. This will not affect passengers who take their lithium-ion powered devices on the aircraft with them, but it will prevent passengers from storing laptops, smartphones, and other battery-powered devices in the cargo hold on US flights.
