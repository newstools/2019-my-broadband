TechRadar reports that the Android version of Opera now allows users to buy cryptocurrency directly through their web browsers. Opera has partnered with Bitcoin exchange Safello to allow Opera users to buy Ethereum from the comfort of their Android devices. Opera users on both PC and Android already have access to a built-in cryptocurrency wallet, but this move takes the browser’s commitment to supporting the cryptocurrency market to the next level. “We think that the next important phase for crypto will come from usage and that for it to reach wider adoption, it has to be easy to buy and easy to use,” said Charles Hamel, cryptocurrency product lead at Opera. The feature is currently only available in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, but given that Safello is an international exchange, the hope is that it will soon be available across the world.
