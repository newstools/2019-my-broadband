I recently applied for my Smart ID card through the eHomeAffairs portal, and was surprised at how well it worked. I booked and paid for my ID application via the Home Affairs website, and selected Standard Bank Centurion – which contains a Home Affairs office – as my application point. Besides an hour-and-a-half wait to have my biometrics captured, the experience was pleasant. The facilities were excellent and the staff were friendly – which is all you can ask for. My application took place on 11 January 2018, and I was told I would receive an SMS when my ID was ready for collection. On 23 January, less than two weeks after I visited the Home Affairs branch, I received an SMS stating that my Smart ID was ready for collection. I waited until that Friday to collect my ID – 25 January – and returned to Standard Bank Centurion. After I arrived at the branch and stated I was there to collect my ID, an employee checked my details and gave me a ticket with a number on it, and asked me to take a seat in the waiting area. My ticket number was called after 15 minutes, and I was instructed to enter the collection section. In there, you are required to provide your thumb prints on an electronic fingerprint scanner, and sign on a digital signature pad. Once my details were verified, a Home Affairs employee handed me my Smart ID with a letter detailing the features of card. And that was it – I had my ID and could be on my way. I also received an SMS right after collecting my ID card stating that it had been collected. Having visited “regular” Home Affairs branches in the past, the process of applying for and obtaining my Smart ID card through the Home Affairs online portal and linked bank branch was a pleasure. Well done Home Affairs for the smooth system and quick turnaround, and well done Standard Bank on hosting the office at your branch.
