Micron and Western Digital have launched 1TB microSD memory cards at MWC 2019 in Barcelona. Western Digital’s SanDisk microSD card offers 160MB/s read speeds, while the Micron card offers read speeds of 100MB/s. The Micron card’s writing speeds are faster, however, coming at 95MB/s – slightly ahead of the SanDisk card’s 90MB/s writing speed. This news comes after Lexar revealed its first 1TB SD card last month, which offers read and write speeds of 95MB/s and 70MB/s respectively. SanDisk’s 1TB Extreme UHS-I microSD card will cost $450 when it becomes available in April, while Lexar’s SD card is already available to buy for $499. Micron has not yet revealed the price of its 1TB microSD card, but it will be available in the second quarter of 2019.
