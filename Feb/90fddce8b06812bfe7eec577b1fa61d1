Last year’s flagship smartphones will soon cede to the new round of devices from Samsung and Huawei, which are set to arrive soon. As these new devices launch with impressive features, their older “flagship” specifications move down to mid-range phones. This means that for those who would rather spend R5,000 on a smartphone than R20,000, the quality of hardware is always improving. Over the years, biometrics, durability, multi-lens camera systems, high-resolution displays, and much more have made their way to mid-range smartphones in South Africa. To show you what is on offer, we have listed the best smartphones you can buy in South Africa for under R5,000 – using pricing information from Takealot.
