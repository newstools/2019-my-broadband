The AA has predicted a big petrol price hike for South Africa in March. “Rising international petroleum prices have resulted in South Africans facing substantially higher fuel prices in March,” said the AA. “The rand-US dollar exchange rate has worked slightly in South Africa’s favour during February, giving savings of up to nine cents a litre. However, this has been shouldered aside by fuel price rises.” The predicted price changes are detailed below. “These price hikes come as toll fees across the country increase tomorrow, while additional increases to the General Fuel and Road Accident Fund levies will apply in April,” it added.
