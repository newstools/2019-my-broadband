The PlayStation Classic is available for 60% off its original $99 price, going for $39 at Walmart and Amazon. The latest price cut comes weeks after Amazon listed the PlayStation Classic for $54.99, amid signals that the retro console is struggling to sell. Featuring 20 games from the PlayStation 1, including Final Fantasy VII and Metal Gear Solid, the PlayStation Classic was marketed as a console that allowed gamers to relive the classics. However, Sony’s retro console has been met with poor reviews, including being labeled as “a mistake” by Engadget, and a “disappointment” by GameSpot. The PlayStation Classic is also incredibly easy to hack, which allows gamers to turn on cheats, emulate NTSC gameplay, and emulate other ROMs. The PlayStation Classic is also competing against other retro consoles such as the Nintendo Classic Mini and the SNES Classic.
