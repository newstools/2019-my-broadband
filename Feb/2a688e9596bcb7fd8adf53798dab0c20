MTN Group has announced that it expects improvements of at least 20% for both headline and attributable earnings per share for the year ending December 2018. This entails at least the following increases compared to 2017’s results: MTN will release its full results on SENS of the JSE around 7 March 2019. It will release an additional trading statement before this, once it obtains “a reasonable degree of certainty as to the likely range within which the HEPS and EPS are expected to be finalised”. For the year ending December 2016, MTN suffered a 77 cent headline loss per share. This was due in large part to a fine imposed by Nigeria on the company for failing to cancel millions of unregistered SIM cards.
