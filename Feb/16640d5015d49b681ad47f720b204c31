WhatsApp has launched an update to its iOS app which enables a new biometric authentication feature. According to the patch notes for the iOS app, users can now require Face ID or Touch ID authentication to unlock the WhatsApp application. This option can be accessed by navigating to Settings > Account > Privacy within the application and enabling the Screen Lock feature. Enabling this means that privacy-conscious users can add an extra layer of security to their WhatsApp conversations â€“ even if their device is unlocked. The feature was launched for iOS beta users last week, and has now rolled out to iOS users across the world. This includes South African users.
