Samsung unveiled its Galaxy S10 range of smartphones this week, revealing four new devices. The company showed off the Galaxy S10e, S10, S10+, and S10 5G at its Unpacked 2019 event, all of which are aimed at the premium sector. While the S10 5G has not been given a local release date, the Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10+, and Galaxy S10e will launch in South Africa on 8 March 2019. South African pricing for the devices is as follows: There are multiple factors which go into the pricing of a smartphone in South Africa, including the base cost the manufacturer must cover, import duties and taxes which must be paid, the rand-dollar exchange rate, marketing and distribution costs, and of course money to keep the brand’s company running and turning a profit. Samsung is no exception in this regard, and this is evidenced when you look at the US dollar pricing of the Galaxy S10 versus rand pricing locally. At the time of writing, the rand was at around R14 to the US dollar, and a direct conversion of the Galaxy S10’s price tag reveals the “real exchange rate” South African will pay thanks to the aforementioned costs. Using the Galaxy S10 (8GB/128GB) as an example, the US price is $899 – while the rand price is R18,999. This produces a “real exchange rate” of R21.13 to $1. As mentioned, this rate does not identify the long list of costs that go into bringing a smartphones into South Africa, but it is an interesting indication of pricing differences in the two markets. The table below shows the US dollar and rand pricing for the Galaxy S10 range.
