Eskom announced that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding from 13:00 today. The power utility said the rolling power outages would run until 22:00. This is the first implementation of load-shedding since 9 December 2018 and is due to a shortage of capacity, the company said. “There is also a need to replenish and preserve emergency water and diesel resources to limit loadshedding possibility magnitude thereof in the following week,” Eskom said. The tweet below details the load-shedding announcement.
