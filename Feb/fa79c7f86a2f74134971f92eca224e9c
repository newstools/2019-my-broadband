Nvidia is making a 3GB variant of the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card, according to a Eurasian Economic Commission listing. The listing details a number of ASUS GeForce GTX 1660 Ti products, which include nine 3GB GPUs and eleven 6GB models. Nvidia seems to be following the same strategy it employed when launching its GeForce GTX 1060 graphics cards, offering two different GPUs under the same label. If this launch follows the same trend, the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 3GB will have less CUDA cores than the 6GB model in addition to less VRAM, making it a notably less powerful GPU than the 6GB model. The listing points to a standard lineup of ASUS-branded graphics cards for the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, including the companyâ€™s Dual, Expedition, Turbo, and ROG Strix variants.
