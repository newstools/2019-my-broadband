Liquid Telecom has announced that MTN will use the company’s 4G roaming service to provide greater Internet access across South Africa. “Liquid Telecom South Africa has secured its first customer MTN to offer 4G roaming to millions of South Africans. This includes LTE services to fuel the growing demand for high-speed mobile broadband. The wholesale roaming service will be made available across Liquid Telecom’s network nationwide,” said Liquid Telecom. Reshaad Sha, Liquid Telecom SA CEO, said “more people than ever will have access to fast and reliable mobile Internet” as a result of the deal. “This builds on our vision to give everyone the right to be connected by bringing high-speed broadband connectivity to all,” said Sha. MTN South Africa CEO Godfrey Motsa said: “This sort of infrastructure sharing deal is good for the industry, as it reduces the need for excessively high capital investment and it is also good for customers, that immediately benefit from even greater access to fast and reliable mobile data.” Liquid Telecom said it has been investing heavily across Africa, where it has the largest independent fibre network at almost 70,000km in length. This is linked to more than 660 towns and cities in 13 countries.
