Sony has unveiled its Xperia 1 smartphone at MWC 2019 in Barcelona. The device boasts a 6.5-inch 4K OLED HDR display, making it the first smartphone in the world to deliver these display specifications. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset and includes 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The combination of a 4K OLED HDR display and a powerful triple-lens camera system makes the device ideal for content creators, said Sony. Sony collaborated with CineAlta to support 4K HDR recording at 24 frames per second on the Xperia 1, and the device has a hybrid stabilisation system to reduce camera shake. There is currently no pricing or release date for the Sony Xperia 1, but it is expected to launch later this year. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297384" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-1.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia 1 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-1-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297386" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-2.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia 1 2" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-2.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-2-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297388" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-3.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia 1 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-3-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sony-Xperia-1-3-595x400.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
