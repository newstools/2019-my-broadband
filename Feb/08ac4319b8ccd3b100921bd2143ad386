The ambitious Mars One project, which wanted to take people to the “red planet”, has been declared bankrupt. Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp came up with the idea, but failed to find the necessary funding to keep the project going. The Mars One project consisted of the non-profit Mars One Foundation and the Mars One Ventures business. The latter was declared bankrupt in Switzerland on 15 January, at which point it was reportedly valued at $100 million. Lansdorp told Engadget that the Mars One Foundation is still operating, but could not do anything of note without additional investment. Lansdorp’s Mars dream is not dead, however, as he claims to be in talks with various parties to “find a solution.” The Mars One project has been criticised in the past, with researchers at MIT suggesting that Lansdorp’s project would result in the deaths of those who traveled to Mars.
