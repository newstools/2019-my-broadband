Eskom has convened an urgent meeting with the company’s executive management and the Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, to investigate recent load shedding. Eskom implemented stage 4 load-shedding on Monday and stage 2 load-shedding on Sunday, following weeks of constant power supply. The company said stage 2 load-shedding was initially implemented on Monday morning, but stage 4 was soon instituted thanks to seven generating units that tripped within a period of five hours. “[A] report on the causes, including all the challenges of the new and old power stations, was much of the deliberations between the board, management, and Public Enterprises,” said Eskom. Eskom said four units have been restored and the remaining three will be online by Tuesday morning. It added, however, that the Medupi and Kusile power stations are continuing to show a lack of reliability and are not contributing meaningfully to the grid. A review of when these stations will be finished has been instituted. Eskom said it will further conduct an in-depth audit of the entire power system to ensure technical problems are understood at a granular level.
