Nike’s $350 Adapt BB self-lacing sneakers are not pairing with the Nike Adapt app properly, meaning their smart functionality isn’t working. ArsTechnica reports that the bug is present on Nike’s Android app and involves the app failing to pair – and therefore cannot tie the shoelaces. Additionally, customers are reporting faulty firmware updates for the shoes, leaving the Adapt BB sneakers completely useless. “Both shoes paired out of the box then during update it crashed… so left me with only my left shoe working,” said a user review. In response, Nike replied: “We are aware of the issue and are actively working on a solution. We apologise for any inconvenience.” Users have suggested workarounds in the interim, such as users needing to perform a manual reset of both shoes.
