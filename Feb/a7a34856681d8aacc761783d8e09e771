Elon Muskâ€™s OpenAI project has developed an algorithm which can create convincing news articles from a short phrase, MIT Technology Review reports. The AI can create realistic news reports on any topic it is given, and evolved from a general-purpose language algorithm which was developed to perform language-related tasks. Once the team realised how easy it was for the program to generate malicious content however, they began to grow concerned over the implications of the technology. OpenAI policy director John Clark said it would not be long before the AI could reliably churn out fake news stories, and predicted that this would be possible in one or two years. Clark said the technology behind the algorithm could prove very useful, though, and may be used to summarise text or improve chatbot conversational skills.
